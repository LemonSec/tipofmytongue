Chloe Messdaghi
MICHAEL: We've got a whole  

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,400
bunch of development talks. In fact, the upcoming 
talk by Chloe Messdaghi and a topic that many of  

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,360
us can probably relate to. Burnout: Destabilizing 
Retention Goals and Threatening Organizational  

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,600
Security. Before we start, I would like to 
take a moment it thank all of our sponsors.  

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,680
We have iNE and eLearn Security, Axonius, 
MongoDB, Juniper Networks, Corelight,  

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,160
Google, We Hack Purple, BridgeCrew. Thank you 
to all of them for making this event possible.
 

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,560
Also, don't forget to check out all the 
other things we have going on. We have  

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,240
awesome villages like the IoT village and the 
mental health village. We have the expo booth  

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,160
that has not only our wonderful sponsors, but 
also there's people who are looking to do hiring,  

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,160
community organizations that you can join.  

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,199
They're not for profits that we support that many 
of you may not know about and be interested in.  

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Different booths have swag, contests and raffles. 
Check out all of these wonderful things.
 

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,680
And now we have our speaker. Someone I'm 
honored to have the opportunity to introduce.  

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Chloe Messdaghi is an award winning changemaker, 
innovating tech and innovation security sectors  

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,040
to meet today and future demands by accelerating 
startups and empowering organizations and people  

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
to stand out from the crowd. She is 
an international keynote speaker at  

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,160
major tech conferences and events and 
serves as a trusted source to reporters  

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,520
and editors such as Forbes and Business Insider. 
Additionally, she's one of business insider's  

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:12,400
50 power plays. And outside of work, co founder 
of Hacking is NOT a Crime. And We Open Tech. So,  

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,800
without further ado, here is Chloe Messdaghi.
CHLOE: Hi, en. And thank you so much, Michael,  

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,000
for the wonderful intro. I'm very touched. 
Thank you so much for that. I'm gonna play these  

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,200
slides now. For everyone, welcome to this burnout 
session. And I want to just put one thing in here.  

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,560
Now, slides I'm gonna talk a lot about how we 
need to be better and how we as an industry can  

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
be better. But there's one part that I left out in 
it, and I wanted to speak on that really quickly.  

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,040
A lot of times when we think of burn out, it is 
when it comes to our companies. The workload and  

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,600
not balancing our personal life. But I also 
want to mention a particular thing, which is  

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,840
our industry. And particularly on social media. 
Burnout doesn't just occur in our work, in our  

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,160
daily life. It also happens when we're on Twitter. 
We are non stop seeing a lot of really concerning  

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,280
things happening on Twitter within InfoSec. And 
it's really important that we keep an eye out.  

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,360
There's so much cyber bullying that is 
happening. And that also leads to burn out.  

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,720
But also, it can lead to people leaving our 
industry. So, we need to do better on that front.
 

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,640
I wanted to bring that up really fast. Because I 
know it's not in the slides. Talking about social  

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,640
media. But I have seen people get burned out from 
it because they're seeing the drama unfolding  

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,760
and just can't believe what they're seeing. 
So, let's try to be better with each other.  

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,000
Because that's how we are as a community. 
And I think this is the time where we need  

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,440
to come together a lot more than ever before.
So, let's dive into the slide deck now. So,  

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,320
welcome to Burnout: Destabilizing Retention 
Goals and Threatening Organizational Security.  

39
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,359
And overall, just think of it this 
way, burnout can be a security threat.  

40
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,040
So, let's dive into that, shall we.
But first, for those that do not know me,  

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,160
Michael did a fabulous job sharing a little 
bit about myself. But I'm the co founder of We  

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Open Tech, and hacking is not a crime. And we have 
been working to get organizations to sign a pledge  

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,240
guaranteeing that they're going to do whatever 
they can to increase the voices of marginalized  

44
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,400
representation in leadership positions. 
Because leadership is the one in charge  

45
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,400
of vision. And in order for us to actually have 
diversity, equity and inclusion, we must have  

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,599
representation at the top. Because there is 
a trickledown effect and that's what we do.  

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,560
I really recommend for everyone to 
check that out. Because we need this.  

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,840
We need this a long time ago. And time's up.
The other organizations you may have heard of,  

49
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,039
which is We Open Tech which is an organization 
for marginalized genders to all come together  

50
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,480
in tech and security. And for allies too. 
Because allies, we're not going to get anywhere.  

51
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,040
It's really to bring a welcoming environment for 
all of us, whatever our gender is, that we can get  

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,480
whatever role we want in life and have the career 
that we should have. Regardless of who we are.
 

53
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,520
Hacking is not a crime is another organization 
that I cofounded with my friend Brian. And we're  

54
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,039
basically trying to change things by challenging 
public perception of the hacker community.  

55
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,920
So, then we can get a change when it comes to 
out of date legislation. Because hackers deserve  

56
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,680
protections, and they deserve rights. And it's 
about time that we've had it. Because it's been  

57
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,760
since the '80s since we've had legislation. And 
it's even before Y2K. It doesn't even add up to  

58
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,840
even today's standards. We need to revisit that. 
Other than that, just giving you the spiel of  

59
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,880
all the things I do. I'm a consultant at this 
time. I basically do product marketing. Mostly  

60
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,159
looking at organizations to help grow and be more 
strategic with their growth internally as well.
 

61
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
I do provide an advice column for Security 
Boulevard called Ask Chloe. Every Friday  

62
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,960
it's a new one. Feel free to ask a question 
so I can answer it. It's also anonymous. Host  

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,479
of the Changemaking podcast on ITSP Magazine. 
If you want to roll up your sleeves with the  

64
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,360
changemakers that are doing the work, this is 
a perfect place for you to learn about them.  

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,200
And if anything else that I'm missing out, 
go ahead and visit standoutintech.com. You're  

66
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,840
not here to learn about me, you're here to learn 
about the industry and what's going on right now.  

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,240
This room may look really familiar to you.
This is RSA conference actually about a year ago.  

68
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,359
We're all in this room. We had absolutely 
no idea what was heading our way.  

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,440
Some of us had doomsday idea. But we didn't think 
it was ever gonna be what we have seen in the past  

70
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,160
year or so. But we were all in this, you know, 
going to events. We were like shaking hands,  

71
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,360
we were giving each other hugs. We were like 
yelling in each other's ears because it's  

72
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,840
noisy and crowded around us. And 
we have no what's going to happen.  

73
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:39,520
That's what happened later on. And at that point 
by the end of 2020, we're just wanting it to end.
 

74
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,400
And even in 2021 at this time, there's this 
glimmer of hope. And we can actually get there if  

75
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,679
we work together collaboratively. Because we have 
to. We have to come together. When we're so broken  

76
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,240
up, we have to come together. But let's also be 
real. To be able to come together, we have to  

77
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,320
recognize that right now we're walking a very 
fine line of just being barely okay and terrible.
 

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,360
And all of us have been dealing with 
burnout at some point this year.  

79
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,159
Okay. Well, maybe not all of us. 
I'm looking at you, New Zealand.  

80
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:27,120
But even New Zealand, even before 2020, we've 
had ongoing issues. And it's been because of  

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,520
our industry. The way that it's set up is not for 
us to succeed. And that's one of the reasons that  

82
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,039
we have to look at this. That this has been an 
ongoing problem before all the chaos in 2020. So,  

83
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,719
it's best that we actually do something 
about it instead of just talking about it.
 

84
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,120
And with burnout, we need to understand that 
we're placing ourselves and our organizations at  

85
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,520
secure risk. And we'll most likely click on a 
link because we're not 100% who we are. And we  

86
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,439
may not patch right or be overwhelmed 
by what is needed to be patched ASAP.  

87
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,240
But let's also be real, sometimes we're seen 
as bots and not as humans. And humans cannot  

88
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,560
handle 24/7 work. It's just be realistic with 
each other. Because we're working all hours and  

89
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,839
we're expected to be on all calls. So, how do we 
even balance a personal life and a work life?
 

90
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Because burnout occurs when we do not practice 
self care. And when our work demands more from  

91
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,680
us and we spend less time on our personal life, 
the balancing is completely gone and stress  

92
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,439
increases. We feel really guilty, 
and we struggle to sleep because  

93
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,040
we feel like we're trying so hard not to drown.
And you may even notice changes on your team such  

94
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,120
as your employs are withdrawn, and become angry or 
sad. Or delays in the email responses or projects.  

95
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,080
This can be seen in remote too. You don't have 
to be present to not see it. And right now,  

96
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,520
working from home and remotely has increased the 
number of work hours. It's also increased this  

97
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:13,280
expectation and really increases the blurriness 
of work time and limits. And some people have  

98
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,839
quit at this point because they cannot handle 
the juggling of work and personal life because  

99
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,520
their company failed them. I want you to 
understand that. The company failed them.
 

100
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Because they couldn't be more flexible. And they 
don't practice inclusion and equity as well.  

101
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,960
And that's one of the things I'll 
just quickly touch on is that  

102
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,480
we are all able to get burned out. But the ones 
that tend to get burned out the fastest are the  

103
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,200
ones that are always seen as the type A. The ones 
that always get their work done on time. And it's  

104
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,600
very hard for them to recognize sometimes when 
they're already feeling burned out. But also,  

105
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,600
when it comes to those marginalized persons inside 
our community, they are striving to be on top of  

106
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,480
everything and will take additional work and 
jobs because it's already hard as it is to  

107
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,920
have that job. Because job security isn't there.
So, that also is a contributing factor to always  

108
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,079
having this off balance lifestyle of life and 
work. Because we're not doing any actual proper  

109
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:28,880
diversity, equity and inclusion at this time. And 
let's be blunt. We haven't had a 9 to 5 job for  

110
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,080
ages. It doesn't exist anymore. And this is a 
contributing factor of why employers are pushing  

111
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,000
employees to work from 9 to 5. And yet they 
still send emails at all hours. They Slack you  

112
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,520
at all hours. And this places you and 
your team at a losing situation because  

113
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,560
they feel obligated to respond. And this 
is why the burnout cycle continues.
 

114
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,720
And for those who are not aware of what burnout 
starts to form and look like, it can be that it  

115
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
used to take a few minutes to respond to an email. 
But now it takes an hour or so. You feel exhausted  

116
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,640
and trapped. And you may even feel empty. You push 
yourself to your breaking point. And where you're  

117
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,640
no longer coming up with ideas. But rather, you're 
taking meds to help with the aches. You're overly  

118
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:26,160
anxious. And that could be over events. Like over 
deadlines, anything. And you can easily cry or  

119
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,680
get angry fast than usual. You may not respond to 
your friends or family when they call or text for  

120
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,239
some time. And then that's when that guilt starts 
entering a little bit because your personal life  

121
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
is slipping, and your life is now your work. And 
you start to feel unappreciated for your work.  

122
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,120
And that gets even worse because you 
then start getting resentful at your job  

123
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,640
and you end up hating it. You start dreading 
your job. And this is the moment where you  

124
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,760
may lose your team members. And sometimes it 
can get so bad that we have people that leave  

125
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,640
our industry because it's left such a bad taste. 
And this is the thing that we have to understand  

126
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,280
and recognize. Because what we have been doing 
is putting employees at a huge health risk.
 

127
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,640
And if you don't believe me, here we go in 
here. So, something to keep in mind is no  

128
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,560
matter how much sleep, you just feel exhaust 
when had you're burned out. You feel also  

129
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,160
emotionally depleted. It can mimic depression. And 
have trouble falling asleep or staying to sleep.  

130
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,959
When we're stressed out and cortisol levels 
increases, it is hard to shut down our minds.  

131
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,720
This causes us to toss and turn, and reduce 
deep sleep or even get enough REM. And when  

132
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,360
we don't get proper sleep, the stress levels 
increase. And mental state can start shifting to  

133
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,000
depression and anxiety systems. When we're 
overly anxious or experience depression symptoms,  

134
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,120
we start to get sick a lot more often. And we 
start having gastrointestinal issues, headaches,  

135
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,800
infections, cold source, rashes, lower immune 
system. When our immune system is low and  

136
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,800
the stress is high, the bones and muscles are 
getting stiff. Your body is on survival mode,  

137
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,240
thinking it's a perceived threat. It can 
even turn into muscle weakness and fatigue.  

138
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,720
If left untreated, this 
increased high blood pressure,  

139
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,480
heart attacks and strokes because there's too much 
adrenaline and cortisol over an extended period.
 

140
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,960
So, overall, clearly burnout is not a joke. 
It's actually very serious. And if we don't take  

141
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,840
care of this right now, we are keep putting our 
colleagues in a huge risk. And ourselves as well.
 

142
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
So, let's start looking at 
the results of our industry.  

143
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,480
Of what happens when the reality of working 
in security. Because the high demand 24/7. So,  

144
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,320
these facts are taken from Dark 
Reading and I'm gonna read them to you.  

145
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,400
Please remember these stats in this research 
was collected priority the pandemic. This  

146
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,600
article did come out in 2020. However, it does 
not reflect what we've gone through too this date  

147
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,240
point. So, please note that these statistics are 
probably much higher than what is being reported  

148
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,080
on the screen or what I'm reading out loud to 
you. 21% of CISOs said they taken a leave of  

149
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:38,400
absence due to job stress. 41% took the step even 
though many report being afraid to take sick days.  

150
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,858
35% neglected to take all their time off. 48% of 
CISOs said their work stress impacted their mental  

151
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,040
health. 45% said this impacted their physical 
health. And 40% of CISOs said that their work  

152
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:59,199
stress impacted their relationships with their 
families or their children. And 32% said that  

153
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,760
it impacted their relationships with spouses or 
romantic partners. 32% said it's impacted their  

154
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,040
relationship with their friends. 23 said they're 
using medication or alcohol to manage stress.
 

155
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
Once again, I want to reiterate. These 
stats are probably a lot higher than  

156
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
what I'm reading right now. And it should also 
be stated that the other reason is that simply  

157
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,920
we're also scared to be transparent with 
other people about the situation that we're  

158
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,760
in. Especially when it comes to mental health. 
We don't really talk about it with each other.  

159
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,319
And this is a problem. Because if we don't talk 
about it, then how does it ever get addressed?
 

160
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:45,120
So, here are some more stats around CISOs. 94% 
of the American CISOs and 95% of the UK CISOs  

161
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,640
reported that they worked beyond their contracted 
hours. On average 10 hours a week or more. In  

162
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:00,000
addition, 83% of American C Suite execs and 73% of 
UK execs confirmed they do indeed expect security  

163
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,680
teams to work longer hours. In other words, we 
are expected to work beyond normal work hours.  

164
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,240
In other words, everything that we're doing, 
we're always gonna be expected to be on call.  

165
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,000
That means there's never a moment to relax. 
Because you never know when you'll be on call  

166
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,400
and it's expected of you. This is not normal 
for most roles. But it is for our industry.
 

167
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,679
Now, the thing to understand is that the 
CISO is your manager and your leader. And  

168
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,920
having somebody who is burned out that leads can 
become very dangerous to employers. This can lead  

169
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,240
to security risk and increasing possibilities 
of managerial issues. Coping with such issues  

170
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,600
can lead to them self medicating on the job 
and making a very    of what is appropriate.  

171
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,600
But once again, this is not the CISO's fault. I 
want to reiterate. The CISO's job is hard because  

172
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,520
whenever there's a breach, they're the 
first to be blamed and the first to be cut.  

173
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,160
It is extremely stressful to have this role. 
And most CISOs only spend one year in the role  

174
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,960
in the first place. Those know once again, 
we have a system that is very, very broken.  

175
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,800
We have an industry that isn't sufficient 
in the long run. And it's never matured.
 

176
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,320
And it's in this industry that it continues to 
fail us. And it runs on people being burnt out.  

177
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,639
And I want to take a moment here. We have 
a foundation that doesn't empower us.  

178
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,840
At all. We have a foundation that 
disempowers us in every single way.  

179
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,399
And there's no wonder we have a rotating door 
and a mental health crisis in our industry.  

180
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,600
And I'm about to show you why it's like this.
 

181
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,679
So, why are we so burned out? Well, of course, 
being in security, we monitor and operate 24/7.  

182
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,200
And sometimes we work throughout the middle of the 
night. And sometimes we cannot sleep well because  

183
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,640
we're always at the edge of our seat. And when 
it comes to security. Because we know attackers  

184
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,960
work at all hours. And we're always worried of 
when that breach will occur. Because we all know  

185
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,160
that if there was a breach, it would be an 
ad hoc style to fix it. Don't believe me?
 

186
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,000
According to the Institute, while response 
planning is better over the years,  

187
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,960
the vast majority of interviews were 
74%. And they're reporting their plans  

188
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,880
are Ad Hoc or applied inconsistently or they have 
absolutely zero plans at all. And additionally,  

189
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,120
more than half, 52% of the security response plans 
said they never reviewed it since it was created.  

190
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,360
Or it had no set time period of 
reviewing or testing those actual plans.
 

191
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,919
So, with COVID 19 and working from home, 
how many of these plans have been updated?  

192
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,919
Yeah. This is one of the reasons why we 
had a 300% increase of breaches last year.
 

193
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,720
And you know what we tend to 
do about it in our industry?  

194
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,880
We don't    we don't think of better 
planning and having less disruption.  

195
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,320
We throw tools at it. Because it's so much easier 
to understand the human element role that plays  

196
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,040
here. It's    it's so    it draws    it just    I 
don't know. As someone who came from outside the  

197
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,360
security world and came in, it is always the thing 
that we do. Which is like, oh, we have a problem.  

198
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,919
Let's just do    let's just throw another tool 
in. The thing is, is that if you don't have a  

199
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,840
proper foundation of understanding the human 
element plays a huge role in security, because  

200
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,679
security is built by humans in the first place, 
how are we gonna be successful? Throwing tools  

201
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,720
at it is not going to be helpful. If anything, 
it's going to make the situation a lot worse.  

202
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,760
Because when we add tools to it, guess what 
happens? It's not in the plan and coordination is  

203
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,680
off and these third party tools. We don't know how 
secure they really are. Are you feeling stressed  

204
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,520
out yet? Perhaps cortisol levels rising? No. Well, 
then I want you to imagine another situation.
 

205
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,639
You know, cruise ship. You know this is 
going to get one of those type of stories.  

206
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,720
But I want you to imagine. You're a part of a 
crew. And you just found out your ship is sinking.  

207
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,080
But you found out after for some time because you 
weren't alerted by your system. And your customers  

208
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,480
are on board trusting you for their safety. 
And your team is scared. And some are actually  

209
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,840
paralyzed by the fear of failing. But they're 
trying their best. But there's one thing you need  

210
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,199
to know. Your crew hasn't slept at all for quite 
some time, and they have a bit of seasickness.
 

211
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,680
I mean, you could actually say that they're 
not exactly 100% state of mind. They're not  

212
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,080
100% charged battery. If anything, you could 
say they're kind of functioning as if they have  

213
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:17,280
burnout. Because it's kind of the same rate and 
scope. Okay. So, now you have the back story.  

214
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,840
That's your situation that you're in. Now, imagine 
your captain pulls out the binder. This safety  

215
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,760
binder that you're like, oh, thank god, there's a 
protocol here. An incident response plan. And it's  

216
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,879
up to date, right? No. Unfortunately, that binder 
that was updated is not on the ship. And you're  

217
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,720
actually having    you are actually using a old 
procedure, but have new features to this ship.
 

218
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,520
Are you stressed out now? Because this is what 
it's like when we're dealing with bad plans.  

219
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,920
And when the human element is not taken into 
account of. It leaves you with a wreckage.
 

220
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,720
The truth is bad actors are everywhere. 
And they attack at all hours. And they drop  

221
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
often, and we constantly need to be up to date of  

222
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,520
what bad actors use. That takes energy and time. 
And this is why we're struggling. We're a part of  

223
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,080
the crew and we don't function well or communicate 
well, and it becomes a really scary situation.  

224
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,480
The reason we're insecure is because 
we know how incredibly important it is.  

225
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,159
But we also need to come to terms that if we work 
around the clock and don't practice self care,  

226
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,960
or even promote employee wellness, what's the 
point of all of this? Because then we could be  

227
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,000
a danger to the organization. As well if we're 
running on low battery and feeling not well.
 

228
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:53,920
And this is why burnout matters. It's not 
just a trendy thing. It's a very real thing.  

229
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,239
And this is why we keep turning to tools 
to try to fix our problem. And not find  

230
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,920
time to plan, prep, practice self care. 
We become that security team that sinks.  

231
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
We won't be able to fix a 
breach fast. And it's scary.
 

232
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,600
And I really want to just reiterate here that, 
please, whatever you do, do not turn around and  

233
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,120
blame your employees for this. And because they're 
not performing as well. Because the majority of  

234
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,000
you, that is what you tend to do. You let go of 
a team member without checking to see what you  

235
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,280
could have done that    that probably could have 
reduced their performance. Because chances are,  

236
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,680
they're probably burned out and feeling very much 
alone. With COVID 19, we're taking care of family  

237
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,640
members opinion on camera daily. Unable to leave 
our homes. Can't see our friends and family. Some  

238
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,920
of us live alone. Some of us put off important 
life events. We've also lost people. We've also  

239
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,320
are seeing our colleagues struggling. We're 
trying to be there. We're always worried about  

240
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,800
our ability to perform and keeping a job. We're 
worried about affording the life that we have,  

241
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,480
and we're worried about COVID. We're worried 
we may not make it through either. We're  

242
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,960
not a machine. We are human. The human element 
created security and runs security. We were all  

243
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,840
struggling with staying okay before COVID and 
during COVID. And I want you to acknowledge that.
 

244
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,000
Except New Zealand. Okay. I'm just going to be 
real with you. New Zealand had it pretty well.  

245
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
And there's a reason why. And 
I want to talk about that.
 

246
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,960
So, how can we lead like the Prime Minister of 
New Zealand? Think about it, she worked with  

247
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,200
people and planned. And when you plan, there's 
less disruption. So, we're going to go through  

248
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,200
a couple of investment things. So, here's the 
first investment. Listen. Take action together.  

249
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,440
In other words, be strong, be kind. Ask your team 
what they need. It's so simple, right? Whenever  

250
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,680
people are like, how can I do better? Ask your 
team. Don't ask me. Ask your team. They're gonna  

251
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,720
tell you how to be better. Because they live in 
that environment. They know that environment.  

252
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,080
They are in there every single day doing the job 
they're supposed to be doing. They're hearing from  

253
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:30,159
their colleagues. They know how to do better. 
You just have to ask and listen. And not just  

254
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,600
listen also, I just to want to reiterate this. 
Take an action. When we listen to each other and  

255
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,320
strategize together on how to improve the team and 
our department, it reduces stress for everyone.  

256
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,439
Because stress happens and we're not being 
listened to. Or we feel uncomfortable to speak up.  

257
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,840
Your colleagues may share that certain tools 
aren't needed. Or that there's a tool that  

258
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,199
does like five things all in one that is better. 
And they may share what is missing on the team.
 

259
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,320
Perhaps less meetings are needed as well. 
By working together on what are the issues,  

260
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,200
we could collaborate together on how to 
reduce the issues or completely resolve them.
 

261
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,840
Investment number 2. Plan together. Strategize 
together. With collaboration and listening,  

262
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,840
working together with the team to make strategies 
revisit your security response plans. Make it up  

263
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,720
to date. Revisit that plan every time a new tool 
is added or removed or there's a team member  

264
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,520
change or environment change and so on. It is so 
critical that by creating and making solid plans,  

265
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,639
it helps speed up your recovery. Reduces 
the stress of when a breach occurs.  

266
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,280
That there's a plan to follow that's up to date. 
You owe it to yourselves and your colleagues,  

267
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:56,320
your organization, your customers. I mean, look at 
what New Zealand did. They planned. Not only that,  

268
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,840
they strategized together. They had 25 deaths. 
You know how about we have had in the US?  

269
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:10,480
Over 560,000 deaths in the US. Because there were 
people that didn't to want to listen to the people  

270
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,600
around them that knew how to do better. And 
they didn't want to take action on how they  

271
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,399
could do better. I know that's controversial 
what I just said. But it is the truth.
 

272
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,240
Because we have to work together. We have 
to listen to each other. We have to do that.  

273
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,800
Otherwise, we're gonna fail all together. 
So, keep your ego in check on that one.
 

274
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:42,960
Investment number 3, encourage self care. When 
dealing with burnout, taking one week off from  

275
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,880
work or anything related to work provides recovery 
for burn out. And I want to say for like a mild to  

276
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
moderate burnout. If you have severe burnout, 
that could take two weeks or more. But that one  

277
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,960
week does help you recover slowly. So, if your 
employee is burnt out, allow them to take time  

278
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,560
off. And a lot of times we don't want to take time 
off because we worry about our team members when  

279
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:16,000
we're going. Or we're more nervous of the thought 
we're going to walk into when we come back. When  

280
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you take time off, it helps a lot because we have 
a lot more clear space in our head so we're able  

281
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,560
to take it on a little bit better. So, it's really 
important that we always encourage self care  

282
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,879
and taking time off and being flexible. That 
also means looking at work hours as well.
 

283
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,640
And lastly, you should probably make sure to 
have one day per week where you have absolutely  

284
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,720
zero meetings. And this allows your colleagues 
to catch up on any items or projects. For  

285
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,400
investment number 4, be kind and respect 
boundaries. Please be kind to one another.  

286
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,800
It is so frustrating to see throughout a pandemic 
where people are being cruel to one another.  

287
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,000
It's not    when the whole world seems like it's 
in chaos, that is the time where we need to come  

288
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,200
together. We put our egos to the side or behind 
us. And we start thinking about how our actions  

289
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,760
impact others. It's important that we understand 
that what we say and what we do can impact another  

290
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,000
individual. So, think it over before you take 
an action. It's so important that we do this.  

291
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,840
Because we need to be kind to one another. Like 
seriously. It shouldn't be like this sometimes.
 

292
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Because from what we have learned, is that when we 
work together and understand how we impact others,  

293
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,800
we are then starting to practice empathy.  

294
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,680
And empathy is certainly missing at our times. 
In our industry. But by listening and being there  

295
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,280
for one another, it remind us that there's people 
who care for each other. Because we cannot assume  

296
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,480
how one person is doing just by how they look. 
Or how they're doing on their performance.  

297
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,080
You could be a high achiever and be in a really, 
really hard place. So, it's really important that  

298
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,199
we don't know what each other is going through. 
But we can always be there for one another. And  

299
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,600
try to understand. So, instead of going at 
someone, refrain from that. And think before  

300
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,639
you speak or act. Because you really don't 
know how that will impact another person.
 

301
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,960
So, as New Zealand shares their be kind message, 
it's because there's an element that we need  

302
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,920
to stick together to protect the world together. 
But also, know that being kind is respecting work  

303
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:49,280
boundaries such as 6 feet distance and a mask.
So, what can you do right now? Okay. So,  

304
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,639
this is what I would love for you guys to do. Take 
a screen shot of this, or take a photo of this.  

305
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,200
Share it with the people around you. Share it with 
your employer. Share it with your boss. Share it  

306
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,200
with your colleagues. Because this only takes 15 
minutes to do all these things right now that you  

307
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,960
see on here. Set up a weekly one on one for 15 
minutes with each employee. If you're a manager,  

308
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,160
you should be doing that. And then 
after that one on one with them,  

309
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,200
don't have any more meetings with them. Just 
do it once a week for up to 15 minutes. This  

310
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,160
is how you build a relationship. This is how you 
build trust. Because when you're micromanaging,  

311
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,920
which was a really big issue throughout the 
pandemic for many folks. Because there's this  

312
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,280
belief that if I don't see you in the office, then 
I don't think you're working. So, micromanaging  

313
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,200
has been very high up there in a lot of complaints 
these days. So, do this instead. Set up a weekly  

314
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,120
one on one for 15 minutes with your employee.
And on that, talk about the products that are,  

315
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,719
you know, on the roadmap. And also, what are 
the items to prioritize? Make it a conversation.  

316
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,600
Be there for your employee. This is 
a great way how to start a trust.  

317
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,160
Now, the next thing you could do is make a 
Monday or a Friday a no meetings day. The  

318
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,320
reason I say Monday or Friday, because it 
doesn't really impact the week that much.  

319
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,760
Because usually a Monday or a Friday falls 
on a holiday. So, it doesn't hurt as much.  

320
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,240
So, making one of those days as a no meetings 
day is great. Because that could be that day  

321
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,680
that everyone uses to conquer any projects that 
they're behind or their emails. I don't know  

322
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,160
about you, but I like interesting a zero inbox 
person. That would help a lot for the folks.  

323
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,280
The next is set up a meeting with the 
team to explore ways to improve together.
 

324
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,440
This is important. If you don't have an incident 
response plan or it's out of date or you don't  

325
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,720
know if you have one, now is the time to talk 
about that. Meet, discuss. What tools do we have  

326
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,720
right now? What tools do we need? What tools 
do we not need? What things do we need on our  

327
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,880
team? How can I be a better manager? How can I 
be a better leader for our department talking to  

328
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,080
other departments? What can I do to make things 
better? Because as a manager, it's your job  

329
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:12,480
to be a coach, a mentor. It's not your job to 
dictate how things should be. It's about working  

330
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,080
together collaboratively and making sure that 
your team can thrive by pushing them up there.
 

331
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,360
And also, the last thing that you can always do 
is create an unanimous survey. And I mean that,  

332
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,000
anonymous. And there might be not everyone 
who wants to respond because they're worried  

333
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
if it actually is anonymous and they're worried 
something is going happen. You want to try it,  

334
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,920
but you can't enforce it. You need to build trust. 
And trust is shown over time through actions.
 

335
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:51,920
Now, lastly, remember, when we work together and 
listen to each other, magic does happen. And when  

336
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,960
we work together making sure people get personal 
time off without the fear of taking time off,  

337
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,160
we're then becoming collaborative. 
And when we collaborate, we reduce  

338
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,680
the stressful items that hold back the 
team from thriving. When we focus on  

339
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,600
balancing work and personal life for 
everyone, that's when we no longer  

340
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,720
have this dumpster fire. And burnout 
is no longer a security concern for us.  

341
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:22,000
Because we know we are human, and we know that the 
human element rules the world that we live in.
 

342
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,520
And whenever in doubt, just remember. If 
New Zealand can plan so well, so can you.  

343
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,080
Because in all of us, there's a Frodo who is on 
a journey to get rid of some malicious threat.  

344
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,279
So, quick overview over this whole 
talk. If you spaced out at all.  

345
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Turnout does place you and your team at a huge 
risk. Not just mentally, but physically as well.
 

346
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,080
The best way how to actually deal with burnout and 
reduce it is to collaborate to form strategies to  

347
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,319
improve the team by asking your team how to do 
better and listening and taking action. Start  

348
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,760
making plans and revisit secure response plans. 
Seriously. We need to do better at that. And I  

349
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,400
know we don't really have enough time sometimes to 
go into a response plan and try to make it better.  

350
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,280
But we have to do this. We owe it to ourselves 
and everyone around us who are impacted by it. It  

351
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,400
will help us. Because if there is a breach and we 
have an incident response plan that is up to date,  

352
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,440
we're gonna be feeling a little bit better. 
Because we will know that we have everything  

353
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,440
covered as much as we did have it covered.
And most importantly, promote self care by  

354
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,480
being kind and respectful to boundaries. Please 
respect one another, you guys. Please be nice to  

355
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,640
each other. It is so important that we do that. 
Because we're in this community together. We're  

356
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,480
a small community. And it    whenever something 
happens to someone, it does impact other people.  

357
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,560
So, we have to be aware of this. That our 
actions and words do hold value. And can  

358
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,880
also impact another individual positively and 
negatively. So, we must do better as ourselves.
 

359
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:12,320
I just want to say thank you all so much for 
attending this talk. And if you want to ask any  

360
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,840
questions, I'm here. I do have over time. So, I'm 
going to stop sharing now my screen and answer any  

361
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,840
questions that you guys may have.
MICHAEL:  

362
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,760
So, haven't seen many questions. That was    that 
was actually a wonderful talk. There was a few  

363
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,080
things you mentioned in there that I noticed 
a lot of people, you know, personally related  

364
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:44,377
to. Especially the zero inbox. Yeah. That    
that's like a myth as far as I know. So   
 

365
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:48,320
CHLOE: Yeah. There are strategies 
to get there. But I have to admit,  

366
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,160
how I do    this actually might be a good skill 
for some other folks that have issue. So, what I  

367
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,600
do is I open my emails. Every time I get an email, 
I open it. If it's something that's going to take  

368
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,440
longer than a couple minutes to respond, I have 
to review or look up or something, I star it. So,  

369
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,960
then I have a zero inbox at all times. But I 
go back to the star items when I have more time  

370
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,680
throughout the day. This helps me don't get 
overwhelmed. Because I'm a type A person. I have  

371
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,279
to answer emails. So, it's one thing. One way how 
to go about that, you still have that zero inbox  

372
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,120
thing. But just note that it's not the unread. 
It's also knowing what to prioritize. That's  

373
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:38,400
gonna help you out with that zero inbox idea.
MICHAEL: Another thing that you    actually,  

374
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I'm going to take that into consideration. I have 
a tendency to star too many things. But another  

375
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,080
thing you mentioned that I really liked was you 
were    you were saying that about how companies,  

376
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,240
you know, how they use tools and things. And I 
mentioned it in chat that they tend to when they  

377
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,600
have these breaches, you know, they want to add 
a red team. And these are things that are very  

378
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:08,720
costly when, you know, the real truth is, if they 
had took, you know, took the time to, you know,  

379
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,400
pay attention to their employees and offered, 
you know, some sort of service, which would be  

380
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,360
a lot cheaper, they could probably avoid that and 
   to some degree    and it would be a lost more  

381
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,560
cost effective to them and a lot more healthy 
to them and the people that worked for them.
 

382
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:34,160
CHLOE: Yeah. It's like this constant situation of, 
I always think of like firefighting in some ways.  

383
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,799
Where we're so into putting out the fire that 
we don't do preventive work. Because we're like,  

384
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:48,000
well, I don't see any return of investment. So, I 
don't need to add money to this. But however, oh,  

385
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,320
my god, when there's a breach. Suddenly, oh, 
here's all the money in the world. And you're  

386
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,680
like, where was this money before? We could have 
avoided this situation. I mean, as someone who  

387
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,480
worked in like marketing and PR, I feel like it's 
better to do preventive work over reactive work.  

388
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,360
Because a breach is gonna happen. No matter what, 
a breach is gonna happen. You don't know when.  

389
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,840
But being prepared helps a lot.
MICHAEL: Definitely, definitely. I agree.  

390
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,920
We do have a question. Somebody wanted to know, 
they said, how do you support employees in staying  

391
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,440
offline when they're on PTO? I made it clear I 
don't expect people to be online. But some still  

392
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,840
carry their laptops around on their days off.
CHLOE: Yeah. It's one of those things where     

393
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,839
it's a tricky thing. You can't really tell them, 
stop responding to messages. But I have to admit,  

394
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:49,280
I remember last year I took my first vacation 
in two and a half years for one week. And the  

395
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,120
first day I was responding to emails. And then my 
manager is like, stop responding. You're on your  

396
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:04,160
time off. I'm going start telling people to stop 
writing to you. It just hit me in that moment. Oh,  

397
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,879
wow. I felt like I was a workaholic in that 
moment. So, the trick is, when you're talking to  

398
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,560
your employees about taking time off, remind them 
that is a good time to disconnect. Meaning like,  

399
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,040
you know, this might be a good time for you 
to turn off your devices, get off of social  

400
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,360
media for a bit. Or just get away from InfoSec 
in general and don't try to study for a cert  

401
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:37,600
test. Do something for yourself. I want to learn 
to play guitar, paint. That's a good question.  

402
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:44,640
We have to be encouraging them to understand 
that it's okay. We have to be reinforcing them,  

403
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,600
it's okay for you not to respond. You're on your 
time off. But do remind them that they should  

404
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:56,960
put in their calendar that they're going to be 
away. And also have that out of office message.
 

405
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,720
And the trick for that for everyone who 
is concerned about that, I'm going to  

406
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,959
tell you something that's easy to do. First 
thing when you're about to take your break,  

407
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,480
make sure you have your out of message scheduled. 
Your message. Now, you want to make sure in there  

408
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,320
that you state one or two days after the date that 
you come back. So, say if you are coming back on  

409
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,840
the 14th, you're gonna say, I'm coming back on 
the 16th. This helps you so much because no one's  

410
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:32,480
expecting you to respond until after the 16th 
then. Also on your calendar, take the whole day,  

411
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,960
the first day you come back, block it. Completely 
block it. Meaning no one can set up any meetings  

412
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,400
with you. You just have that day for you to 
respond to emails and catch up on what jobs you  

413
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,960
need to do. And when you come back on your first 
day, also make sure that you look at your emails,  

414
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,480
kind of get a sense of what's going on. But then 
what you're gonna want to do is message your  

415
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,040
teammates and ask if there's any pressing issues 
that you need to respond within the next 24 to 72  

416
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,800
hours. So, then you can also draw your attention 
to that. This helps you be on top of everything.  

417
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,200
Gives you about two day period of catching up. 
And without having any impact or stress on you.
 

418
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:21,200
MICHAEL: Very true. I personally    one of 
my main worries when it comes to taking time  

419
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,600
off is can I afford it? You know? And questions 
like that. Instead of, you know, realizing that,  

420
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,320
you know, regardless of whether I can, you know, 
quote, unquote, afford it, my mental health is  

421
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,600
more important because it will affect me more 
long term than, say, a short term problem that  

422
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,720
I could, you know, fix in other ways.
CHLOE: Exactly.
 

423
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,759
MICHAEL: Go ahead.
CHLOE: Exactly. It's like  

424
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,960
that completely. If we don't take off, you're 
gonna start failing a little bit more in work.  

425
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,600
And the last thing you want to do is lose your 
job. So, always put your mental health first.
 

426
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,400
MICHAEL: We have another one. How have you 
successfully communicated the value of self care  

427
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,040
business cultures to higher ups? In my experience, 
culture trickles down from the executive level.
 

428
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:18,000
CHLOE: Kate, I love you. I don't know you. 
I think. But I have to admit one thing to  

429
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,520
you. You are completely right. When it's the 
executives, they're the ones that set the vision.  

430
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,600
They're the ones that dictate how it's 
going to impact the rest of the company.  

431
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:33,759
This is one of the reasons why I strongly 
believe we'll never have DII until we have  

432
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,360
those in leadership positions filled with people 
that are marginalized. You're completely right.  

433
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,680
But the good news is you have a manager. And your 
manager is supposed to be there to support you.  

434
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,560
And it's so important that they support you. If 
you have a boss that isn't gonna be there for you,  

435
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,799
that isn't wanting to coach you, mentor you, and 
see you thrive beyond them, you have a bad boss.  

436
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,360
I hate to break it to you. A good manager is 
someone who is like, so, what do you want to do  

437
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:11,360
for your career? Excellent. I'm gonna help you get 
there if you want me to help you out. You tell me  

438
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,000
what you need from me, and I will be there. That's 
a manager that you want. You want a manager that  

439
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,080
understands be flexible, but also wants to see you 
thrive. That is the job of a boss. And they can't  

440
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,360
really do too much other than go to the executive 
teams and say, hey, we have this problem. I have  

441
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,800
been there before. I go to an executive team. We 
have this problem, we need to fix this. And it  

442
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,000
gets ignored because they're thinking of profit.
They have to understand that  

443
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,520
sometimes you don't see the profit 
immediately. It takes time to show it.
 

444
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
MICHAEL: Definitely, definitely 
agree. And, you know,  

445
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,080
when I read that question, I personally 
can relate to that because, you know,  

446
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,919
a lot of companies, it always    you would go 
to a meeting, and you would hear whatever the  

447
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,240
higher ups are telling you about safety and 
this or that. And, you know, and that goes,  

448
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,240
you know, for most things at businesses. But 
having a business that actually, you know, can  

449
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:17,359
reverse that process and let it flow in the other 
direction and pay attention to what the employees  

450
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,080
are saying and the problems that they're having. 
You know, that's    that's just as important.
 

451
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,680
CHLOE: Yeah.
MICHAEL:  

452
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,399
Well, that    let's see here. We... 
I'm trying to read through these.  

453
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,480
Yeah. It seems like a lot of people can relate 
to this. And I know    I know personally. Yeah,  

454
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:50,080
it's a big thing. I'm one    one of those people 
who I can't say no. So, I end up agreeing to this  

455
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:57,279
and to that and to this and to that. And before 
I turn around, all I have are deadlines. And  

456
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,200
I look at the calendar for today and    oh, 
no. And so, here I am at 2:00 in the morning  

457
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,960
still working. And then, oh, I'll take a day off 
to catch up. Well, that day off, like you said,  

458
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:18,320
is meant to not work and to relax. And I just 
   you know, I really do    I really can relate.  

459
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:25,360
And I feel like a lot of people in here can too.
I personally have been following Chloe for quite  

460
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:34,720
some time now. She has a very    a very avid 
interest in people. All people. And I really  

461
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,200
like how, you know, she goes for it and tries 
to not only change the opinions and the views of  

462
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,120
people that are, you know, you know, higher up in 
government all the way down to the average person  

463
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,880
so that we can all relate to each 
other and have better mental health.
 

464
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,880
CHLOE: Thanks, Michael.
MICHAEL: Yeah. One last question we have is how  

465
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,200
can you set those boundaries after you have been 
doing it and is now    and it is now expected?
 

466
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,439
CHLOE: That is a great question. 
Hi, Miki. I would say that...  

467
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,799
that's a really good one. I'm going to 
be honest. There's going to be times when  

468
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,800
your employer is not going to be happy that 
you put down boundaries. But the thing is,  

469
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,600
I want you just to know that if you have other 
team maybes that have similar boundaries,  

470
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:35,680
this maybe a good thing. Having kind of 
like a All Hands in for your team or having  

471
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,040
those like weekly one on ones with your manager, 
it might be a good time to reiterate like, hey,  

472
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,040
I just to want to let you know. When you send 
me a Slack message after 5 p.m.? I'm not gonna  

473
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:54,320
respond to it. If it's something urgent, I would 
prefer that you text me. That's gonna let me know  

474
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,280
that I need to respond to it. Because I'm 
gonna be off of Slack during my off hours  

475
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,680
so I can do all the things that I want to do. 
And I don't want to be attached to my laptop.
 

476
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,720
That's kind of how the way I've done it in 
the past. Which is like I'm gonna be offline.  

477
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,839
I'm always offline at this hours. But if it's ever 
an urgent thing, text me, call me to let me know.  

478
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,320
I think that's one way we can do it. Always give 
them one thing to note. Like this is my    this  

479
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,520
is my boundary. I'm not gonna respond during 
this time. But if there's something urgent  

480
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,080
during those non work hours, you can do this 
instead. I think that's really helpful for  

481
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,799
everyone. Because let's be real, I feel like all 
of us want to be off Slack and Discord for an  

482
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:46,000
hour because we just need to turn off our minds.
MICHAEL: Yeah. Definitely. I personally have  

483
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
learned a lot from this. And I'm gonna try to 
apply a lot to them. First thing I'm going to do  

484
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,960
is get on my phone and unpin Discord and Slack. 
They're pinned. I can't turn them off. I think  

485
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,440
   are we out of time? Do we have 
time for one more question? Or is  

486
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,920
   I don't know. I think the cutoff is...  

487
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,831
okay, yeah. We're out of time.
