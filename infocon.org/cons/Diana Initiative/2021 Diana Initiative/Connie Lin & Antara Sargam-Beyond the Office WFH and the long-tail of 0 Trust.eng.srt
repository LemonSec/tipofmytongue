and uh mentioned that if you haven't

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
checked out the career village do do so

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
they're doing resume review and mock

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
interview and all that awesome stuff

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
so today we have connie

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
and tara joining us from google and

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
their talk is titled beyond the office

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,800
work from home and the long tail of zero

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,879
trust very interesting stuff and the

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,760
stage is yours

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
hello everybody i am anthra

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
and i have my co-presenter here with me

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
connie

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,440
so today we're going to be talking about

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
the building blocks of a zero trust

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
model like a xero trust security model

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
and google's own version of it called

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
beyond corp

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
we will also go over how this model

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
enabled google to safely send our entire

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
workforce to work remotely during the

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,640
covert crisis and also what adjustments

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
had to be made along the way

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
so before we go deeper a little bit

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
about me i'm currently working as a

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
security engineer in google's enterprise

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,080
infrastructure

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,560
focusing mainly on access control

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
prior to joining google i completed my

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,400
in information security from johns

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
hopkins university

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
and in my free time i just love

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,840
exploring new music charming with my

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
friends and also volunteer my time to

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,960
educate the underprivileged kids

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
i'll pass it over to connie to introduce

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,479
herself

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,600
yep hi everyone i'm connie uh i am also

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
a security security engineer at google

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
working currently on vulnerability

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,360
management but for the last um

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
two three years i worked on access

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,479
control with entera and before google i

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
worked in security automation and

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,360
detection

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
and graduated from drexel university

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
with the bsms and information systems

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
uh during quarantine i've been doing a

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
bunch of different things including

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,400
learning how to make kimchi and

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
perfectly bothering my cat and uh trying

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
to grow a plant horde

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
and

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
i don't know watching it slowly

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
shrink in size but

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,239
uh

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,120
yeah um now we'll go into the talk

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
so for

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
an overview of the talk uh we're gonna

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
cover why beyond corp

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
what is beyond corp how to build it

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,800
yourself and the long tail

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
so

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,440
now um i guess i'll start with yb encore

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
some of you might be wondering why our

72
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,200
zero trust initiative is caught beyond

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
corp um corp is the pseudonym for our

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
corporate infrastructure so around 2009

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,239
we realized that our existing

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,640
infrastructure was flawed so we embarked

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
on this over a decade-long journey to

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
reimagine our infrastructure so we

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
wanted this new thing to be more secure

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
enable folks to work outside of our

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
existing physical locations and we made

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,040
it

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
we ended up making all of our internal

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,920
apps publicly accessible so we ended up

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
naming this thing beyondcorp

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,799
um also to clear some things up we now

87
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
have a product uh called beyondcorp as

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
well and it takes a lot of the lessons

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
that we've learned in um from this

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,159
journey

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,080
and tries to make that solution more

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
accessible for um other people so this

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
presentation is not about that product

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
product called beyond corp but it is

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
about the why how and challenges of

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,920
implementing zero trust yourself

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,399
so um with that let's dive into the why

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,760
so

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
what google had before was a fortress

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
model also known as a perimeter defense

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,360
model in many ways this is still the

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
industry standard

103
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
and in this fortress model you basically

104
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
take all your valuables all your your

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,080
servers your clients any other

106
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,519
infrastructure that you need to make it

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,959
happen so that's like network devices or

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,399
um

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
other glue and you put them in one big

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
pile and then you

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
build a big strong wall around it so at

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
the end of that you have all your

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
goodies on the inside of this wall which

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,759
you consider your trusted zone and then

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,960
you have all the bad things on the

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
outside of this impenetrable wall

117
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,400
and

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
that's the untrusted zone so the only

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,400
way to cross between these two zones

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
should be via a guarded entry point

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
and this is typically done using vpn

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
technology that lets you pass the

123
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
firewalls

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
so this is

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
definitely a bit simplistic of a picture

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,880
um

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
as an industry we you know we found some

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
shortcomings on this model so we started

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,800
adding multiple layers of walls moving

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
to you know the casino model with

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
concentric layers of ever increasing

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
security uh or sorry every increasing

133
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,160
sensitivity of the assets inside or

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
dmz's to uh

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
borrow an analogy from the military with

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
demilitarized zones where you might put

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
things that the public needs to access

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
but you still need to push content to it

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,880
from your own corporate services

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,039
but overall this is how most

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
organizations implement their intranet

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
and how google used to do it

143
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
so

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
now let's dive uh into the flaws that i

145
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,919
mentioned before

146
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,160
um the fortress models as i just

147
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
explained relies on this impenetrable

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
wall separating the trusted and

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
untrusted zones this is almost never

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
true in reality that the wall is

151
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
impenetrable we needed to enable

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
productivity which often means allowing

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
outbound connections for people that

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
need to figure out how to exit vim or

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
see memes and email threads

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,919
security is always like a cat and mouse

157
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,160
game so you know malware

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
quickly figured out that uh to

159
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
proliferate and figure out how to like

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
work in such an environment they just

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
needed to have the infected client

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,440
initiate the connection to their cnc

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
server outside of the environment

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
um as well the security of the devices

165
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,800
accessing um corporate data was kind of

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
like an afterthought it's on the inside

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
of this wall right so nothing bad can

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
happen to it it's all trusted

169
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,319
but the machine is also part of the

170
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,160
attack surface if it can reach the

171
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
sensitive data and create a copy of it

172
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
locally so now what happens if the

173
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,919
machine or the

174
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,360
hard drive is ever taken out of the

175
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
perimeter well now we have unprotected

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
corporate data on the wild

177
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,880
we

178
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,720
introduced you know antivirus and

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
intrusion prevention detection systems

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,800
on those hosts but uh it kind of helped

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
cover some of the gaps but didn't solve

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,160
the issue entirely

183
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
so now we have firewalls vpns maybe

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,199
machine search proxy and firewall block

185
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,360
lists host a bunch of like host bay

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
think host based things

187
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,680
and that's a lot of disconnected data

188
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
sources and enforcement mechanisms

189
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
so responding to incidents were um was

190
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
often like a very time intensive

191
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,720
uh

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,599
and laggy process we'd have to get an

193
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
alert investigate parse logs revoke

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
machine certs

195
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,319
um

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,039
to kind of cut off the additional access

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,919
and every one of those steps takes time

198
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,720
to make up for those issues like we said

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
previously the we kind of just doubled

200
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
down at adding more walls or

201
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
trying to like you know kind of

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,199
show up solutions and in those gaps that

203
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,160
we found

204
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,280
but

205
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
you know at google it seems to us that

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
there are some fundamental issues in

207
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,080
this assumption that the model is based

208
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,039
on and just kind of

209
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,479
continuing to patch over it like

210
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
wouldn't solve the problem

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,199
so

212
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,039
in addition to these pre-existing issues

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,919
we also had some

214
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
new changes that were

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
like challenging the underlying

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
assumption of the fortress model most of

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
these things aren't new but they were

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
fairly new about a decade ago when we

219
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
started on this journey

220
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,080
so the first one of those is the

221
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
increasingly mobile workforce this kind

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
of broke the assumption that clients

223
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
were always on the inside of those

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
physical locations that we controlled so

225
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,879
um

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,199
with this mobile workforce vulnerable

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,680
and compromised devices were regularly

228
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
brought in and outside of the perimeter

229
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
and we needed to use the vpn to stretch

230
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,399
the castle wall to those remote devices

231
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,799
on top of that we had a plethora of

232
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,200
client devices used by those this mobile

233
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
workforce so now we had a support new

234
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,159
device types cell phones tablets laptops

235
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,200
on top of

236
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
traditional

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
desktops

238
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,080
and we ran into vpn usability issues on

239
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,839
those types of devices

240
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,000
we needed to make it um

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we needed to make our workforce able to

242
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
work regardless of where they were and

243
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
what kind of device they were using

244
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,120
the third thing was the emergence of

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,800
cloud services and software as a service

246
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
that meant that a bunch of our corporate

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
services were no longer on-prem

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,360
they actually were you know outside our

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
perimeter somewhere

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
in various data centers around the world

251
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
so we had to poke holes in our perimeter

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
to allow those services to function and

253
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,279
that further blurred our traditional

254
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
perimeter and trust domain assumptions

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
um remember when like

256
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
vendor security was a new hot topic in

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
security uh that was like right around

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
when all kind of like target and home

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
depot were breached if you guys remember

260
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
that

261
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,399
um so the last thing that

262
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,200
the

263
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
kind of all that combined to

264
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
lead us to have concerns about our

265
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
security posture

266
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,360
and how much our threat model actually

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
covered our attack surface and our

268
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,399
ability to respond to ever increasingly

269
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,600
sophisticated attacks that we're seeing

270
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
so

271
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,920
in late 2009 we also had an event that

272
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
kind of pushed all of this to its head

273
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
google discovered that we were a victim

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
of a targeted apt attack tied to the

275
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
people's republic of china this ended up

276
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
being named operation aurora and it

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
affected dozens of us-based companies

278
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,959
google wasn't the only one we were just

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
the first to publicly just go disclose

280
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
it in january 2010.

281
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
um as a result we pulled google search

282
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
out of china the first photo is from

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,360
an ad hoc memorial that people made out

284
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
of one of our um the google signs in

285
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
front of one of our china offices

286
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
so this was a huge deal because it

287
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,079
demonstrated that

288
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,680
demonstrated all of our fears about

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,959
lateral movement

290
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
um in the fortress model

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
the attackers were able to

292
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
move around our environment and

293
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,120
exfiltrate source code and were looking

294
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,920
to

295
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,040
target

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
emails of human rights activists

297
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,760
and this was the first big apt attack

298
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
that targeted private entities but we

299
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
knew it wouldn't be the last

300
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,959
so

301
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
all of that led to

302
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,399
a realization

303
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,360
that no matter how many walls how high

304
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
they were how thick where they are that

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
walls don't work

306
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,399
and there would always be a soft

307
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,000
vulnerable center

308
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
so we went back to first principles and

309
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,360
decided to remove the walls completely

310
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
so now i'll pass it on to antara to go

311
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,640
over

312
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,839
what is beyond

313
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,680
court you connie for that history right

314
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
there

315
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,200
so earlier we kept saving our

316
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,959
infrastructure by putting more and more

317
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,640
walls around the perimeter right like

318
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,399
connie just explained

319
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
and it's not

320
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,920
easy to scale and where i also realized

321
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
that walls don't work

322
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
so let's talk about like what is beyond

323
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
corp also known as the zero truss model

324
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,040
but in order to understand zero trust

325
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
let's look at a particular scenario

326
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,079
first

327
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,480
so look at this picture and imagine like

328
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,880
a cosmopolitan city uh and all these are

329
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
employees that are mingling with anybody

330
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
on the street

331
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,240
like if i ask you can you really tell

332
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
who is an authorized user simply based

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,639
on where they stand on the street

334
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
probably not right so think of this

335
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
position in the street as like a node in

336
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,399
the network right

337
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
the point i'm making is that you

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
shouldn't be relying on determining who

339
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
is an authorized user just based on

340
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,839
where they are in the network or which

341
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,079
network uh they come from like for a

342
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,600
reason scoring the status right like

343
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
walls don't work

344
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
so instead we want to identify them

345
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,760
based on their identity and what device

346
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
they have in their back pocket

347
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
and this is the foundational principle

348
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
of a zero trust model

349
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
to put this into words

350
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
there are three core principles that

351
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
come out of this scenario the first and

352
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
foremost is the first principle is that

353
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,480
we no longer determine who you are based

354
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,920
on your ip address

355
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
so in other words right like your

356
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,880
location doesn't matter at all like

357
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
you're coming from a coffee shop or

358
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
you're coming from the inside the office

359
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,240
it shouldn't matter

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
the second is like access to a service

361
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
should only be granted based on what we

362
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,320
know about the user that is you right

363
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
and the device that is initiating the

364
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
connection and obviously there's a lot

365
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
of complexity that goes into determining

366
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
the state of the device and we will talk

367
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
about that a little more in detail in

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
the proceeding slide

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
uh

370
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,720
third and last code security principle

371
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,519
is that device no matter where it is in

372
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,440
the world has the ability to connect to

373
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
our cloud services in a very safe and

374
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
secure manner so in other words like all

375
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
traffic should be authenticated

376
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,800
authorized and encrypted no matter where

377
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
you come from

378
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,040
these foundational principles actually

379
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,000
helped us define our mission statement

380
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
so what were we trying to achieve like

381
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,279
what was our mission when we talked

382
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
about these principles right

383
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
we wanted to completely re-architect our

384
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
infrastructure to move away from a

385
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
perimeter model that is remove any

386
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
privileges that have been granted solely

387
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,399
based on the ip address or like the

388
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,680
location

389
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,720
uh

390
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
to redefine like to put it into simpler

391
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
words like completely remove the need

392
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
for a privileged corporate network don't

393
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,279
trust the corporate internet any more

394
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
than you trust the public internet

395
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,279
or to put it into a more like

396
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,959
understandable and user-facing

397
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,199
definition we wanted to enable every

398
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
googler to work successfully from

399
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
anywhere in the world from any device

400
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,839
and without needing a vpn

401
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
what this in effect means is we are

402
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
putting all of our internal corporate

403
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,519
application out on the public facing

404
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,480
internet

405
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
while still enabling a safe and secure

406
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,320
access and in turn protecting our data

407
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,519
and this in fact is a big deal right so

408
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,000
let's see how do we actually build our

409
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
own zero trust by going over like the

410
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
building blocks of

411
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
the zero trust model

412
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,519
but before we dive deep one thing to

413
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,399
remember

414
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,959
is that zero trust is not a technology

415
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,199
right it's just a methodology and with

416
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,519
it comes a lot of reliance on all these

417
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
systems working coherently in sync so

418
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,279
we'll go in into like what builds such a

419
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,600
model and what was our beyond corp model

420
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
if you look at this this is a very high

421
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
level uh diagram of the four major

422
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,120
components of beyond cup that we're

423
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,959
going to be talking about

424
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,720
and that is identity which is the user

425
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
the context which is the device that's

426
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
initiating the connection the rules

427
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,959
engine which is the central policy

428
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
engine that defines all your access

429
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,519
control

430
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,120
and then you have the enforcement point

431
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
which is basically where all the

432
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,839
connections uh terminate

433
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
let's let's go into each of these

434
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
components a little more in detail um

435
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,959
first and the foremost is the user right

436
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,120
so talking about the user the most basic

437
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
foundational concept is that you need to

438
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
know your users

439
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
so the need to have like a good and

440
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,040
accurate knowledge of your users is very

441
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
necessary now this isn't something new

442
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
in the security world like you obviously

443
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
most companies have an active directory

444
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
with information about the users

445
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
but what's important uh is to be able to

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
track like the entire lifecycle of a

447
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,000
user and that's exactly what we do here

448
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
at google

449
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,639
so in order to provide access to a

450
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,040
particular service you need to know who

451
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,480
actually needs it

452
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
like following the principles of least

453
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,680
privilege which is like a core security

454
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
principle right

455
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
just following that like we have pretty

456
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
fine-grained controls on which user is

457
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
allowed to access what

458
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,720
and we are obviously working on

459
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
improving that every day because scale

460
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,480
so we we track hr attributes about a

461
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
user we check which job function they

462
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,399
belong to and then we provision access

463
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,040
based on these attributes

464
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
we've also strengthened our

465
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
authentication by adding more and more

466
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
security controls so for example abuse

467
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
detection

468
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,399
what so what can we detect about like

469
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,639
the anomalies in these login behavior

470
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,600
right

471
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
we've also

472
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
moved on to replace

473
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,959
otps with security keys for two-factor

474
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,199
authentic authentication and one thing

475
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,759
to remember is these keys are inherently

476
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,440
phishing proof and phishing resistance

477
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,279
and provides a very strong

478
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,600
authentication mechanism so it's it's a

479
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
big win from moving away from otps

480
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,799
um the third most very important thing

481
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,400
we did for strong authentication is

482
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
session length control so we cut down

483
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
the session length making users

484
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
re-authenticate after a certain period

485
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
of time has elapsed so this reduces the

486
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,799
risk of session hijacking credential

487
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,880
theft by ensuring that you know sessions

488
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
that were only on machines actively used

489
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
by the users are actually allowed

490
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
otherwise you can imagine like there

491
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
would be like active logins and

492
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,840
credentials all over the place which

493
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,679
actually spreads out the attack surface

494
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,679
a lot

495
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,480
moving on to the second most important

496
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,559
component of this zero trust is the

497
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,679
device that is initiating the connection

498
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
so we put a lot of effort in determining

499
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
the latest state of the device so if you

500
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,039
remember we moved completely away from a

501
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,440
model of network location trust to what

502
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
we know about the devices and hence it's

503
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,600
very important to understand its latest

504
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,559
state

505
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,720
so like one of the basic prerequisites

506
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,280
is that it probably is used in the

507
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
traditional model as well is to keep an

508
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,039
accurate inventory of the devices

509
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
connecting to your infrastructure and

510
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
obviously this inventory should tie a

511
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,200
device with a particular unique id so

512
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
suppose we use machine certificates

513
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
but what's important in a zero trust

514
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
model is that we are able to accurately

515
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
calculate the trust we have in a device

516
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
based on various attributes so for

517
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,679
example like is the device up to date

518
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
does it have the latest security patches

519
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
does it have the latest config is it

520
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,960
running on a trusted operating system is

521
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,679
just encryption enabled is secure boot

522
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,960
enabled like

523
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,440
what are the security uh health logs

524
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,039
that are we that are being received from

525
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,880
the device like what's its latest state

526
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
etc etc like this is like a very small

527
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
subset of what we actually check for the

528
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
device

529
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
but based on these answers that we get

530
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,400
for these questions we we basically

531
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
assign a trust here to the particular

532
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
device device right so there are

533
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,039
different levels of trust that you can

534
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
have in a particular device from

535
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,360
minimally trusted to fully trusted and

536
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,039
etc

537
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,520
so how do we actually calculate all this

538
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
trust

539
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,520
and we will we'll just go like

540
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,039
this is also pretty high level on how we

541
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
calculate there's a lot of complexity

542
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,039
that goes into this but from high level

543
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,039
if you see this diagram there are

544
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,720
few important components i want to just

545
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
highlight here in the device like cycle

546
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,760
management one thing you see on the top

547
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
the colorful piece which is the device

548
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,799
database

549
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,640
this is the centralized data warehouse

550
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,720
which contains information about devices

551
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
in our corporate environment from

552
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
various several data sources

553
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
so we keep track of devices from the

554
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
time it's procured to its end of life

555
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,280
and every update on the device from tiny

556
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
details about their even like the make

557
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
changes on the device that's updated to

558
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
this particular inventory

559
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
right and then what happens the second

560
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
most important component is the device

561
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
in parent service that you see on the

562
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
right side

563
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
this is responsible for interpreting

564
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,880
facts about the device information that

565
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,559
we are getting that it gets from the

566
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,960
database and then it makes decisions

567
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
about what trust here that particular

568
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
device

569
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,520
should be assigned to obviously

570
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,240
identified by certificate right

571
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
based on all of this information

572
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,559
imagine like if we identify a malware we

573
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,200
have the ability to immediately uh bring

574
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
down the trust level of a service from

575
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
suppose it was a fully trusted and we

576
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,280
identify a malware we can easily bring

577
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,679
it down to minimally trusted or not

578
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,919
trusted and that will immediately stop

579
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,080
uh that device being able to access any

580
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,039
of our services or applications

581
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,760
and

582
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,120
that's a big thing right that's like

583
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,440
automatic uh we are able to bring down

584
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
the trust and stop it from connecting

585
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,679
any further to our services

586
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,919
so all of this trust information about

587
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
the device and the user all of the

588
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,240
information then feeds into the access

589
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
rule engines which was the third

590
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
major component

591
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,679
to be able to make access control

592
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,120
decisions

593
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,240
so as we have a great inventory of users

594
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
and devices and we track its entire life

595
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
cycle it gives us the ability to

596
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,200
configure access control list based on

597
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
this trust data so we define access

598
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,640
policies based on like

599
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,080
what's the state of which user is

600
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
connecting is it the user active what's

601
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
the state of the device is it healthy

602
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,159
etc right and all of this then feeds

603
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
into our rules engine that makes all

604
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,080
these access decisions

605
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,200
um

606
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,360
so yeah it's based on what we know about

607
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,440
the user like i'm just gonna press more

608
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,799
about this point like what we know about

609
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,640
the user and what we know about the

610
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
device based on the trust level

611
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
these rules uh then inform our

612
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,720
enforcement point so

613
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,799
on on the next slide if you see like

614
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,799
think of this enforcement point like a

615
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,280
proxy layer right so all enterprise

616
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,520
applications at google are exposed to

617
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,400
the internal and external clients via an

618
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
internet facing proxy so this is an

619
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,640
internet facing proxy that enforces

620
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
encryption between the client and the

621
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,559
application

622
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,840
and one thing to note is the access

623
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
proxy is configured for each application

624
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,520
and provides some common features such

625
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
as global reachability load balancing it

626
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
also terminates the tls connection uh

627
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,559
for the client access control checks um

628
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,039
and reliability work is like

629
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,080
even denial of service actually so if

630
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
you think about it lot of security and

631
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
reliability work is automatically done

632
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
for a particular service at this proxy

633
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,880
level so bringing up a service

634
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,280
internally is is much faster um that way

635
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
this proxy then basically delegates

636
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
requests as appropriate to the backend

637
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
application after all these access

638
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
control checks are done

639
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,559
so all of google's enterprise

640
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,799
applications are exposed externally and

641
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,960
are registered in the public dns with a

642
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
cname pointing to the applications at

643
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,400
this

644
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,080
internet facing proxy

645
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,679
if you if you look at the diagram again

646
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
so we this is the same diagram the same

647
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
four major components a little more

648
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
deeper with the flow diagrams this is

649
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,360
still a very high level diagram

650
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,000
uh but if you see how all of them come

651
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,840
together on the right you have the user

652
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
database you have the machine database

653
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,559
all of this data feeds into the pipeline

654
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,679
on the top that then calculates trust

655
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
to make secure access decisions right

656
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
and these decisions are made at the

657
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,679
rules engine on the top there

658
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,760
so when a connection is initiated the

659
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,840
enforcement point interacts basically

660
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
with the rules engine to make like a

661
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
holistic access control uh decision for

662
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
that particular connection

663
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
and one very important thing to note is

664
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,039
that all of this information is checked

665
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,960
constantly for every connection that is

666
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
initiated so every connection is wedded

667
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,960
the same way without any inherent trust

668
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,720
in that connection and this is a very

669
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
important point because if you compare

670
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,120
this to the traditional perimeter model

671
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
when a user is

672
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,640
basically authenticated the machine

673
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
might be authenticated with the machine

674
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
search

675
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,240
but check is typically done one time

676
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
and after that user and device are

677
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,559
due to their network location right

678
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,240
which when you compare it to beyond corp

679
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,159
where there is no longer an implicit

680
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,640
trust if you're inside the network

681
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,799
this heavily cuts down lateral movement

682
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,240
if you think about it

683
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
right

684
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
but

685
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,000
it's a complex architecture this is a

686
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,039
very dumb down high level uh view of

687
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,480
that architecture

688
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,520
and with all of this complexity i'll

689
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
take a pause just think about this

690
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,120
architecture but

691
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,840
there comes a long tale uh of this so we

692
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,559
began this work in 2010 and the work is

693
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,880
still ongoing in a way right so i'm

694
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
going to pass it on to connie to go into

695
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,880
the details on the long tail which is

696
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,200
very important

697
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,039
yeah thanks hunter

698
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,360
um so yeah after all you set the uh

699
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
after you said all all those pieces uh

700
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,960
there's still a good amount of work to

701
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
be done

702
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
so

703
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
may the there's a

704
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
couple different themes for a lot of the

705
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,840
work that we've been working on still

706
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,559
one of the the main one is

707
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,960
finishing what we started

708
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
well so for the first one of those is a

709
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,679
privilege networks turn down

710
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
when we first turned up beyond corp we

711
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
hardened our infrastructure we turned on

712
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
public internet access for all of our

713
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
internal applications and we migrated

714
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
our on-premise employees to a new

715
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
untrusted network

716
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
um and this that whole transition was so

717
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
seamless that some of our remote

718
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,679
employees thought that you know that

719
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,600
they were able to access our

720
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
internal applications without a vpn was

721
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
like a security flaw in an accident so

722
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,480
that was kind of a fun story for our

723
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
response teams like getting those

724
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,240
reports of like hey did you guys mean to

725
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
do that

726
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,039
um but

727
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,720
in order to make that

728
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
transition as seamless as it was we had

729
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,440
to keep up the privileged network for

730
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
use cases that still relied on the

731
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
implicit network trust

732
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,000
and

733
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
we've still been working on removing

734
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,520
those exceptions and our almost nearing

735
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,120
turn down

736
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,760
the second part of that is

737
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
we needed to support non-compatible

738
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,480
hardware so removing those privileged

739
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,039
network exceptions means that our those

740
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
exceptions like existed often because

741
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
there were non-supported cases

742
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,480
and

743
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,919
um

744
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,840
in general that meant anything that used

745
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,480
like proprietary protocols weird ports

746
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,039
expected unfettered network access or

747
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,640
had minimal authentic support and an

748
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,080
example of that would be building

749
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,000
management systems they're generally

750
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
expected to just kind of have

751
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,360
open l2 access to whatever they needed

752
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,640
and

753
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
um didn't have too much like

754
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
authentication support

755
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,679
so another example of things that um we

756
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
had to find another solution for was

757
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,720
things that had high throughput low

758
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,240
latency or required peer-to-peer traffic

759
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,799
and that didn't work well with um you

760
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,240
know our setup because beyond corp

761
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,960
relies heavily on an access proxy and

762
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,360
with an access proxy you have to be able

763
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
to direct those connections to that

764
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
proxy um you know enable that

765
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
software to

766
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,120
use our authentic or delegate that to

767
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,480
our service

768
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,039
and also not overwhelm our proxy's

769
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,919
bandwidth or um be able to handle the

770
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,640
the minor latency um

771
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
that

772
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
the you know trip to

773
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,440
the proxy and

774
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,000
that the the trip to the proxy would add

775
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,679
so there's a bunch of things that we

776
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,000
kind of relied on to kind of fix this it

777
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
was um a mix sometimes we changed

778
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,919
fenders for some things we're rolling

779
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,159
out software-defined networking

780
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,960
and

781
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,799
maybe even a little bit of vpn in some

782
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,320
places

783
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,200
um so the last thing is also just

784
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
removing legacy configurations

785
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,720
so i would recommend uh just a general

786
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
recommendation finish your rollouts and

787
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,080
remediations

788
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,720
um you know this is a a pretty complex

789
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,279
environment with a lot of

790
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,000
um different moving pieces

791
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,120
and

792
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,200
so like you know left unfinished

793
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,559
pretty much the environment gets more

794
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,799
fractured and complicated over time and

795
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,080
there's like increasingly few

796
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,159
breadcrumbs or people that know enough

797
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,520
things to enable you to figure out

798
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
what's going on

799
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,000
so for example when we suddenly went um

800
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,559
sent all of our our workforce to home we

801
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,399
ran into some issues because we never

802
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,480
removed a legacy configuration in a

803
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
specific environment that required

804
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
network trust

805
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
and as a result when those services were

806
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,159
like suddenly unreachable out of office

807
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,320
our sres had to like go digging into old

808
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
documentation

809
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,000
and like do some sleuthing to figure out

810
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,080
was responsible and then make a you know

811
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
a kind of like hasty change which is

812
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,600
never what you want in a production

813
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
environment

814
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,520
um so

815
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,080
the second theme of the thing of

816
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,320
our long tail work is increasing

817
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,200
protections for devices

818
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,799
the first thing is that we've increased

819
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,320
the coverage of the security

820
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
measurements that we're pulling from

821
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,399
from devices we went from are you up to

822
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,360
date are you an inventory to collecting

823
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
um data on security agent health

824
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
packages installed patch levels

825
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,120
certificate data user observed or in

826
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,760
inventory as ontario mentioned in the

827
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
earlier sections

828
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,440
all of that was to kind of improve our

829
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,279
confidence and being able to say that

830
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,039
the machine

831
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,559
that we're seeing is the one we think it

832
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,240
is and that machine is a secure one um

833
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
also when things moved off premise we

834
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
had to shift more of our

835
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,399
protections and detections to the host

836
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,600
that was um you know true in the the pre

837
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
beyond zero trust world but also true in

838
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,880
here but i think the main difference

839
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
with you know zero trust is that things

840
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,919
are already moving off premise in the

841
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,159
fortress model so this is kind of us

842
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,960
just

843
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
kind of baking that into the model and

844
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
uh integrating everything so it worked

845
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,240
seamlessly

846
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,399
the second thing that we worked on was

847
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,039
uh tightening the controls on those

848
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,480
um

849
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,640
on the devices so

850
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
a main differentiator as i said with

851
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
beyondcorp is tying those device checks

852
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,559
to access

853
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,399
to data so

854
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,440
um

855
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,520
an example would be like if a patch is

856
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,279
available and

857
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,039
uh we might say that the device has to

858
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,960
be patched in two days instead of five

859
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,000
days and that kind of again improves our

860
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,520
ability to say that the machine that

861
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,279
we're seeing is secure

862
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,600
also our heavy use of chromebooks means

863
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
that there's less data lying around on

864
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,679
devices and just walking around the

865
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,600
world

866
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,840
a third thing is that we have various

867
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
efforts to improve uh certificate theft

868
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,679
including attestation

869
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,919
and that's kind of because the you know

870
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,799
um

871
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,440
certificate is the primary id that we're

872
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,159
using to be able to say that the devices

873
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,440
the you know uh that links all the data

874
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,279
to a specific device

875
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
and that's pretty um

876
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
a difficult one that we're still working

877
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,320
on but

878
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,159
you know we had a lot of other things to

879
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,880
work on and now we're kind of able to

880
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
tackle this piece and

881
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
that you know is pretty crucial for us

882
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,240
to be able to say that the machine that

883
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,960
we're seeing is the one we think it is

884
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,159
so

885
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
the last one

886
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,399
that um we've been spending a lot of

887
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,640
effort on recently is scaling up and

888
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
improving operations

889
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,600
so

890
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,159
we now have about ten thousand access

891
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,799
rules and five to ten times uh our

892
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,559
device measurements than what we

893
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,279
originally had and that's

894
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,120
not something we quite planned for

895
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,720
partially because we had so much to do

896
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,399
already with getting the infrastructure

897
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,039
up and migrating people over so now

898
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,679
we've been fix uh focusing on

899
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,279
easier uh usability for example

900
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,360
access issues were previously very

901
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,600
confusing for service owners

902
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,640
and engineers and end users to kind of

903
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,840
figure out like when they countered them

904
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,919
what to do they were given a confusingly

905
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,720
worded error code and just had to like

906
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
open a support ticket and just like

907
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,720
search and figure out like what does

908
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,399
this mean and what am what am i supposed

909
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,840
to do with this

910
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
uh now we've changed to make those error

911
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
codes more human readable and provide

912
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,559
remediation steps that these

913
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,120
end user can resolve themselves

914
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,279
and that kind of saves end user time and

915
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,200
frustration and

916
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,799
turnaround time

917
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,880
and frees up support personnel to work

918
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,440
on other things the second thing is

919
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,039
making things more self-serviceable um

920
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,120
kind of like with roommating uh

921
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
resolving your own issue access issues

922
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,200
on a similar note we kind of we made

923
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,000
changing access rules easier before you

924
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,320
needed a text editor and to interact

925
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,480
with revision control to make access

926
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,840
rule changes

927
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,679
we had different workflows for different

928
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,039
types of access access mechanisms

929
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,799
that change depending on what

930
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,320
environment you're in

931
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,159
and that made really hard to kind of

932
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,159
like build a mental model of what you're

933
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,240
supposed to do and how it's supposed to

934
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,279
be done

935
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,760
so now we've created a service that has

936
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,200
a nice user

937
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,360
interface that has lots of hints that

938
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,440
allows non-technical folks to more

939
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,679
easily make access rule changes

940
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,000
we are also pulling in service metadata

941
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
and

942
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,320
user group data to kind of

943
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,679
build a measurement of the sensitivity

944
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,600
and risk of a change

945
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,559
and

946
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,320
the exposure of a service

947
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
so now when service owners want to make

948
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,559
a low risk change um they don't have to

949
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,960
get a security engineer involved and

950
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,159
with that we reduce the ticket volume by

951
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
86 and greatly reduce the turnaround

952
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
time for service owners

953
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,159
to manage their own um applications

954
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,960
the last one is reduce and essentially

955
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
manage exceptions

956
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,279
it's

957
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,760
really hard to see the real risk profile

958
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,280
of a service if an exception is

959
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,679
if exception information is started

960
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,320
in

961
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,239
amongst various teams in different

962
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,839
places

963
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,760
undocumented

964
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
if that's the case like it's really hard

965
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,199
to know

966
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,839
what the current environment

967
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,679
looks like and to be able to reason

968
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,480
about like a user or a service

969
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,719
so we've been working on building in

970
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,119
more automatic exploration so that

971
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,119
exceptions kind of solve themselves over

972
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,520
time instead of piling on and growing

973
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,320
so after all that

974
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,879
that's a lot of work already but uh the

975
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
work's not done um

976
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,839
beyond corp right now uh mainly applies

977
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,000
to client-to-service communications we

978
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,480
still heavily rely on perimeter defense

979
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,800
for services service communications we

980
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
might have definitely thrown a bunch of

981
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,560
extra walls in there but it's not the

982
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,599
the rosy picture that client to service

983
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,520
communications looks like

984
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,680
and as i said the work is never done um

985
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
beyond corp is a methodology and a new

986
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
operational model

987
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
similar to when you turn on a sim

988
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,960
and then you often have all this data

989
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,720
come in you don't usually just turn on a

990
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,119
sim and walk away you now need someone

991
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,720
to keep it running to improve your

992
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
alerts to add newer alerts

993
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,280
and respond to those alerts so beyond

994
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,960
corp is much the same

995
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
now that we have all this infrastructure

996
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
in place we've been adding more

997
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,720
adding more things and building on top

998
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,359
of it and i expect that will continue

999
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,320
so now i'll pass it on to andrea to give

1000
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,200
our key takeaways

1001
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,079
all right uh thank you connie so

1002
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,240
that was a lot of information i like it

1003
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,240
like it was ten years of history and

1004
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,839
technical stuff that we have been doing

1005
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,119
uh and done in the past but i i just

1006
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
want to summarize like the key takeaways

1007
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
that we want you to go away from this

1008
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,320
particular talk

1009
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,240
and the first and foremost is relying on

1010
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
perimeter defense is risky right you

1011
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,960
don't want to trust

1012
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,720
a particular connection just because of

1013
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,480
the network location because we have

1014
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,400
seen over and over again

1015
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,160
on based on the attacks that we have

1016
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,640
seen that this is not a secure model

1017
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,480
right this is not the best out there

1018
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
there has to be more

1019
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
we want to basically base all our access

1020
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,280
decisions on what we know about the user

1021
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
and the device that they're using these

1022
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,440
are the two major components of a trust

1023
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,119
in a connection type who's the user

1024
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,720
initiating the connection and who's the

1025
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,200
device if you can actually accurately

1026
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,079
calculate that and trust that um it's a

1027
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,520
big win right

1028
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,560
but also this requires a very dedicated

1029
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,800
and ongoing effort so if you're going to

1030
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,680
build your own zero trust model uh in

1031
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,040
your enterprise we would highly uh

1032
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
ask you to require like exact level

1033
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
support and dedicate a team of people

1034
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,720
who are actually working towards this

1035
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,520
right

1036
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,440
and obviously everybody's solution would

1037
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,079
be different right google is a very big

1038
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,800
infrastructure it's a pretty complex

1039
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,880
infrastructure so it took all this time

1040
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,200
and effort but everybody's solution is

1041
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,280
going to be different so right in your

1042
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,040
own model that you have right now you

1043
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
can start incrementally right with

1044
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
whatever information you already have so

1045
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
suppose if you're using vpns you can

1046
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,680
start

1047
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
like

1048
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
pulling in more information about the

1049
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
device start calculating okay what is

1050
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,480
the latest state of the device and

1051
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
maybe authorize and authenticate based

1052
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,320
on that state also like incorporate that

1053
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
into your network that's a big one step

1054
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,680
uh already into the zero trust model

1055
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,480
right so don't let like the perfect bb

1056
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,160
enemy of your progress right google

1057
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
infrastructure is complex then most of

1058
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,200
the infrastructures out there we work on

1059
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
things from like self-driving cars to

1060
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,720
ocean sensors

1061
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
so there's a lot that is being done

1062
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,119
so the long tail that we spoke about

1063
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,040
your long tail could be much different

1064
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,960
and probably not as crazy as google's

1065
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,520
not long-tailed right so

1066
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,359
that's what we want you to take away

1067
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,079
from this like video trust is the next

1068
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,119
big thing

1069
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,320
in enterprise security uh but you can

1070
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,440
always

1071
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
start from where you are in your

1072
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,520
enterprise right journey right now

1073
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,400
um and that sums up

1074
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,960
thank you a lot for listening

1075
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,000
to

1076
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
questions
