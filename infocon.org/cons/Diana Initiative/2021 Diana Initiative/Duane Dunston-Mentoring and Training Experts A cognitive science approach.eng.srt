it's great to see you all uh let's have

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600

very special treat for you mentoring and

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,679
training experts a cognitive science

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
approach by dwayne dunstan

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
just a note before we start from our

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,920
sponsors

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,520
so we would like to thank our sponsors

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000

got sonia's mongodb juniper networks

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
corelight google we have purple bridge

16
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,160
crew

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,840
thank you to all of our sponsors i do

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
apologize for my technical difficulties

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,199
and not being able to show you the slide

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
right so let's move on to the event of

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
today we've got

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
an expert with us today so dwayne is an

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
associate professor of cyber security at

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
champlain college in burlington vermont

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
he has been in the industry for over 24

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
years working in both the education and

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,799
government sectors he focuses on risk

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
management cryptography security

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
education and using technology for

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,520
social change in addition to teaching

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,759
and consulting doing is a member of the

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
vermont cyber patriots program he's

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
completed his doctoral coursework at

34
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,720
northeastern university and has started

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,040
working on his dissertation

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
so i'm really looking forward to this

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
talk today i think that's probably

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,880
enough from me for now i'm going to pass

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,399
it over

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,000
welcome jane

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,280
thanks ariana i appreciate it and

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,759
welcome folks

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,119
first we want to really thank our

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
sponsors for helping to put on this

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,679
event

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,799
and

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
you got a quick rundown of my bio my

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
focus is on cognition and learning

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,799
so i want to go ahead and define two key

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,399
concepts i'm going to use for this

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,679
presentation

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,239
a novice

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,239
so when we're going into something new

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,560
we typically have the the faculties and

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
the

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,599
wherewithal to learn

57
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,920
and those include critical thinking and

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
and problem solving but mimicking is

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
also really important because we have we

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
have naturally learned to mimic what

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,400
other people do and that's who how we

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
become who we are and stay safe as well

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
and an expert when i use the term expert

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
i mean someone that has domain specific

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,120
knowledge in a particular field so they

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
have a lot of knowledge about that topic

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
folks like who do reverse engineering on

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,920
a daily basis or threat intelligence

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
they are an expert because they have

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,400
domain

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,879
specific knowledge about that field

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
this talk is a follow-up from my

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
presentation at diane initiative from

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,360
last year where i talked about a case

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
against google it a cognitive science

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,319
approach and at the end of that

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,560
presentation

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,879
someone just made a comment that really

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,159
stood out to me

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
and when we'll talk about what i talked

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
about was cognitive load theory and

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
cognitive apprenticeship theory and how

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,640
you can use those for mentoring

84
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
novices or for to help someone develop

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
any kind of expertise for example in a

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,360
presentation

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,239
our

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,799
our novice if you will was a windows

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
system admin who wanted to learn linux

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
administration and linux security as

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
well

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,319
during q a

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
somebody stated this does not seem to

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
scale

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
and that's that comment stuck with me

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
and so this is a follow-up to explain

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
how that that statement that someone

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
made and if you're listening today thank

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,519
you for that comment

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,280
uh well i'm going to talk about how

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
these principles still apply in some

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,519
ways but not completely

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,519
because

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
of this thing called the expert reversal

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,080
effect in cognitive load theory the

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
expert reversal effect occurs or means

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
that

108
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,439
methods of learning that apply to

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,799
novices

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
don't apply to experts because that

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
learning could actually be detrimental

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
for them especially if they're in

113
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
college or in some kind of

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,040
training program and they're getting

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
some kind some type of grade for it it

116
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,680
can actually undo the

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
schemas the long-term knowledge that

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,919
they've built up over time

119
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,639
so that statement does have some

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
validity by all means

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,840
so these principles of

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,880
of novices learning can apply to experts

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
in some in some some ways

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
what experts need though are they need

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
coaching and they need feedback and

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
advice

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
on what they want to learn and that's

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
what i want to talk about and there are

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
some cognitive apprenticeship principles

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,360
that apply to this coaching and feedback

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,639
so first of all when you

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,400
look in school you

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
get a grade or you do an assignment you

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
get a grade you get feedback on how well

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,919
you did or how well you didn't do

136
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,680
that's different from advice

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
because when someone gives advice

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,639
they're providing you a response and

139
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
an opinion or on ways to improve your

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,720
performance so if you didn't do well on

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
a test they give you advice on what you

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
can do next time to do even better or

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,479
allow you to resubmit so that you can

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
demonstrate that you've learned from the

145
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
advice that was given so that's the main

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
two differences between feedback and

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
advice one is a response the other is

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,880
more action oriented

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,080
so how do we train experts

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,360
what do mentors need to know

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
generally deliberate practice is what

152
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,840
you want

153
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,840
and i'm pausing there because of the

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
redundancy effect

155
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
um in cognitive load theory you have

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,479
audio which you're listening to me talk

157
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
right now and you're reading something

158
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,560
and your working memory is very limited

159
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
and if i talk and read the slide while

160
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,479
you're trying to read this slide it can

161
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,919
cause you to

162
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,280
not focus on what i'm saying so that's

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
why i get these pauses periodically

164
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
so this deliberate practice

165
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
it's a repetitive

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
willful attempt to change or improve on

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,080
your performance like harpreet's um uh

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,639
presentation on on purple teaming when

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
the teams come together and they find

170
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
weaknesses and a person see that they're

171
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
weak in something they can deliberately

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
set out to improve themselves in that

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
and that's different than just someone

174
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,599
who's a general practitioner a general

175
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
practitioner performs a task and they

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
may refresh their skills but they don't

177
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,400
willfully do something over and over and

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
over to get better and better and better

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
and better at it so that deliberate

180
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
practice is how we train and mentor

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
experts

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,039
and

183
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,400
the the the learning environment

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,199
has to be specific to the person based

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
on what it is they want to learn so

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
that's why it can be sometimes difficult

187
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
to find the right training for an expert

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
because what they need the most help

189
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,919
with may not be available

190
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,039
and some things we're going to talk

191
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
about is ways that we can we can allow

192
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
this to still happen so to use myself as

193
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
an example i just learned excuse me i

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
just got my certificate from

195
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
certification and miters um

196
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
attack cyber threat intelligence

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
now i could download reports

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
threat and tell reports i can download

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
how a piece of malware works and i can

200
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
map that to the miter attack framework i

201
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
can do that if i wanted to

202
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,400
but what i did is i got a mentor who can

203
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
do something different

204
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,520
someone who can

205
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
allow me excuse me someone who can help

206
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,639
me

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
really learn how to apply

208
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,680
the

209
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
miter attack framework to different

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,240
scenarios that's my deliberate practice

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,319
i want to get better at what what i'm

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
doing i did really well with raw data i

213
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
didn't do so well when i tried it out

214
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,400
with the

215
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
threat intel report where it's like a

216
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
lot of details about how the attackers

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,120
or the malware works so i'm asking him

218
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
for help and he's providing me reports

219
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
and then i'm meeting with him so we can

220
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
go over those results together so he's

221
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
not just going to provide me feedback

222
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
but provide me advice on how to improve

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
a specific skill set that i'm not

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,039
developing so if i don't understand how

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,880
a specific type of attack works and i

226
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
keep mapping it or missing it he's there

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
to help me and i can keep practicing

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
that over and over and over until i get

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,760
it

230
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
more than that

231
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,959
is that

232
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,839
the

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
process i want to go through is a bit

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,839
more demanding so

235
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
deliberate practice engages someone in a

236
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
cognitively hard task essentially giving

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
them a really hard problem something

238
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
that's going to require them to really

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,279
uh push them to the to their limits and

240
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,399
so you know if you heard alyssa's

241
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
keynote this morning one thing she

242
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
really talked about is that the mentor

243
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,560
needs to know their their mentees so

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
that they can determine what's the best

245
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
material i can give to them based on

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
their skill level

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
and then the feedback and advice is

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,959
super important so that i can improve

249
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,080
and get better at what i want to do so

250
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
okay dwayne you're doing really well now

251
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
with mapping to mitre now can you apply

252
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,560
this to a

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
industrial control system can you apply

254
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
this to an education organization so

255
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
it's pushing me

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
to to take my skills to a different

257
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
level i'm not just downloading reports

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
and mapping

259
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
just for skill development i'm doing it

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
to become really good at it in different

261
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
different fields so that requires

262
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
repeated practice

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,160
and repeated meetings with my mentor to

264
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
help ensure that i am fine-tuning those

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,399
skills i need the most help with

266
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,240
and when i make mistakes i need to

267
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
want to make mistake my mentor is there

268
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
to help me correct those

269
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
so i don't keep doing the same thing

270
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
over and over and over again

271
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
now some of you may have heard this 10

272
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
000 hours of practice makes you an

273
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
expert but a lot of the academic

274
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
literature is showing that

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
it's not the number of hours

276
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,279
that determines if you're an expert

277
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,680
because i've been this for 24 years now

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,480
and

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
i've got more than 10 000 hours

280
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
but

281
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,720
if your quality of your experience is

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
not very good

283
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,839
then the quantity doesn't really matter

284
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
and so it has to do with people who

285
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
spend the time in deliberate practice

286
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
and the number of hours they spend in

287
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,480
that deliberate practice so if i spend

288
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
a lot of time trying to understand

289
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
industrial control systems and then

290
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
trying to apply the minor attack

291
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
framework to the industrial control

292
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
system

293
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,480
then that is what my expertise starts to

294
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,640
develop from that but it's not so much

295
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
the number of hours because again i can

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
download reports until i retire but not

297
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
do anything with that knowledge so the

298
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
number of hours is not that important

299
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,279
more so than the work i'm doing

300
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
there's also this concept of dynamic

301
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
practice and a good mentor

302
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
who knows their mentee really well

303
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,399
can

304
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
ensure that if i get a really

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
hard problem like if he tells me next

306
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
week okay duane i want you to apply this

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
miter attack framework to an industrial

308
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,959
control system

309
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,240
i don't know much about industrial

310
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,480
control systems so he may say okay

311
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
that's too hard for you so what i'm

312
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,200
going to do

313
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
i will give something a bit easier here

314
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,279
apply this mutter attack to a university

315
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,279
i have some framework to work with there

316
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,959
and i have some knowledge about the

317
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,360
education environment and so it's a bit

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,160
easier for me and then over time

319
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
i can progress to industrial control

320
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
systems

321
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
and it's really important that the

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
mentor allow time for feedback so when i

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,079
present my report next week to my mentor

324
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,600
and he looks at it and says okay the one

325
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,320
you missed these here or you set it as

326
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
this but it's actually this over here

327
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
why did you choose this option and now

328
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
and i can explain i can reflect on why i

329
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
chose that option and then that allows

330
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
time for my mentor to say oh i see why

331
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
but it's actually this here for these

332
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,279
reasons

333
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,120
and so once again

334
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
i'm getting the feedback and i'm getting

335
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,200
advice on how to improve that the next

336
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,480
time around

337
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,720
and if i meet up with my mentor

338
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
you know i don't know

339
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
three times a month for example this is

340
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
theoretically three times a month and he

341
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
sees him not doing well i keep messing

342
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,000
up on that part then he's gonna give me

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
specific

344
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,920
reports that focuses on that weak skill

345
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
that i have but again that comes from

346
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
your mentor and mental relationship

347
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,800
being really strong having a strong

348
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,079
communication with each other

349
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,319
and

350
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
this applies to cognitive apprenticeship

351
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,600
theory

352
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,240
so dynamic practice is cognitive low

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
theory because a cognitively demanding

354
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
task means that i'm not going to do very

355
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,480
well

356
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
and so let's take a step back so you

357
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,959
don't get unmotivated take a step back

358
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
and try this here

359
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
and within cognitive apprenticeships

360
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
what it does the the

361
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
the central

362
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
prince of the central uh thesis if you

363
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
will

364
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
for cognitive apprenticeships is

365
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
a

366
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
cognitive apprenticeship is just like a

367
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
regular apprenticeship like we know it

368
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
you have a master you have a

369
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,800
student

370
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
except it makes thinking visible

371
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
you you provide feedback to your

372
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,279
mentee you allow the mentee to reflect

373
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,800
you observe what the mentee is doing

374
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,639
so that's cognitive apprenticeship

375
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
theory that can still apply to

376
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,439
an expert

377
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,959
so what do we do to

378
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,680
allow deliberate practice especially

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
when

380
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,240
expertise

381
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,199
expert development

382
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,079
it can be hard to come by because again

383
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,399
you go to an advanced training class and

384
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
advanced boot camp

385
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,639
but the problems that are presented to

386
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,360
you

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
are too easy so you don't really develop

388
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
the skill you were hoping to

389
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
and a lot of employee employers

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
want their

391
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
employees employees to take training so

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
they can keep their skills up to date

393
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
and apply that knowledge to to where

394
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,839
they work

395
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,560
so

396
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
something that training providers can do

397
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
those commercial companies that pay for

398
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
that um you know you go to their site or

399
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
they come to your site

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
is provide case studies that you've that

401
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
they've heard about from industry

402
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,199
partners

403
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,040
and recreate those

404
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
and allow

405
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,639
the students to work on those to see how

406
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,399
they solve that problem

407
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
and then after they've worked through it

408
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,120
and and demonstrated their knowledge

409
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,399
then

410
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,399
the training provider can give them the

411
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
report by the

412
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,720
you know fire eye or or mandia for

413
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
example and how they were able to

414
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
uncover whatever the issue was in the

415
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
case of mandion they may have an instant

416
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
response

417
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,600
or a malware infection that's recreated

418
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
in the in the um training

419
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
and then you see their report to see how

420
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
they solve the problem and if you see

421
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
any weaknesses something you didn't pick

422
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,079
up then that's a skill that you can now

423
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,279
incorporate into your deliberate

424
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,079
practice oh i need to

425
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,759
learn more about

426
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,240
interpreting pcaps or network capture

427
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,560
that you can load into wireshark or i

428
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,519
need to

429
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,079
get better at identifying the behavior

430
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
of malware so

431
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,320
case studies can help with that

432
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
deliberate practice for

433
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,519
for experts

434
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,399
also community-driven heart problems and

435
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,160
again when i say hard problems i mean

436
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
something that really requires a heavy

437
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
cognitive

438
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
um

439
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
demand

440
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
to to solve

441
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,000
novel attacks that people experience if

442
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,040
you follow folks on twitter you often

443
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,199
read about these reports of people who

444
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,720
are uncovering these really novel

445
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,279
attacks and something that could be done

446
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,000
is people could put together or recreate

447
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,639
that attack and then and allow people to

448
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,320
work on it themselves to see how they

449
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,040
did

450
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
and then they can read the final report

451
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
because not only

452
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,639
is the person who's doing their uh who's

453
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
who who is

454
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,160
who's attempting to

455
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
uh completely attack learning

456
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,319
but they may report something that the

457
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,439
person who

458
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,760
um submitted the who who recreated that

459
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,000
attack learned so learning can happen in

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
in in any environment really

461
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
for example the height of that project

462
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,039
where they used to post

463
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,439
um the pcaps and the activity of an

464
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,319
attacker and then the community

465
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,679
wrote a

466
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
community people all over the world

467
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,320
anywhere could download that that case

468
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
and then write a report on it but even

469
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,120
more than that is that the honeynet team

470
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
reviewed the reports

471
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
and the top three won some kind of award

472
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
or whatever it was

473
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
but the benefit of it is that another

474
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,679
expert or team of experts is reviewing

475
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
what people did and they post those top

476
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
reports so that other people can learn

477
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,840
from them as well

478
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,760
so what we could create is a community

479
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,080
of a database of hard problems in

480
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
different fields threat hunting instant

481
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
response threat intelligence

482
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,799
reverse engineering and if anybody in my

483
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,080
students our students at champlain

484
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
college can tell you if you don't follow

485
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,760
binary zone

486
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
on twitter you should he gives really

487
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
hard problems for example and people can

488
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,919
recreate those

489
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,200
situations that they've been involved

490
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
with

491
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,480
and post them for public consumption and

492
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
for public analysis as well so people

493
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
who are who are looking for that

494
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
deliberate practice any specific skill

495
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
more than likely will find something if

496
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
they have a broad database

497
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
in which to choose from

498
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,160
and then this concept of work examples

499
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
work examples is probably one of the

500
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
most effective methods for training

501
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
offices that's where the person who's

502
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,960
teaching

503
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
show them step by step how to perform a

504
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
task

505
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,559
instead of saying go google it for

506
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,240
example or

507
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
you know

508
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
no that's not the right report where'd

509
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320
you find the information from show them

510
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
how to do it and in many cases

511
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
experts still need some guidance like my

512
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
fictitious windows admin

513
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,559
needed some guidance on how to transfer

514
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
the knowledge from windows over to linux

515
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
so there's still some aspects of of

516
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
teaching novices that are appropriate

517
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
for export experts but it requires

518
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
understanding the individual experts

519
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
you're working with and what their needs

520
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
are as well

521
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
so thank you folks for attending and

522
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,799
again this was a follow-up from my last

523
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
uh for the last council last year to

524
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
address the the comment about

525
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,400
the case against google it not scaling

526
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
well hopefully this has demonstrated how

527
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,120
you can well one way in which you can

528
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
help experts develop especially if they

529
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,039
start to get bored

530
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,120
or they need to hone a skill

531
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,840
um

532
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,360
you know hopefully we can start a

533
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
project where a database of hard

534
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
problems can be recreated and people can

535
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
can jump in and and work on those

536
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
you're welcome to follow me on twitter

537

currently this month i'm talking about

538
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,080
how to document a system security plan

539
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,480
and i'm using the cis controls to

540
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
explain what you should document based

541
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
on their control so feel free to join

542
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,200

545
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
talked about

546
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,240
for this topic

547
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
all right ariana are there any any

548
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,360
questions

549
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,760
popped up

550
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
hi yes brilliant thank you so much thank

551
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,960
you so much for your talk that was

552
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,120
incredibly insightful in such a short

553
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
amount of time as well so i'm just going

554
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
to look at the audience i

555
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,159
does i don't have any questions for

556
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
dwayne on anything that you've heard or

557
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
listened to

558
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
all right so is there a specific twitter

559
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
account for binary zone

560
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
yes

561
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,200
um he spelled the o it's a zero so

562
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,140
binary zone together the o is a zero

563
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,120
[Laughter]

564
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
cool binary zone right i've put that in

565
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,840
the chat so you should find it there

566
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
cool so another question we have is

567
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,200
there a name for this behavior and how

568
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
to combat it i really want to learn this

569
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
new technology but i'd rather watch a

570
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,120
two-hour presentation than sit down and

571
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,520
use the tech on my own

572
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
well yes um you know in general uh

573
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
people may be intimidated to ask

574
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
questions or not know how to ask

575
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,039
questions so it's good to watch a video

576
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,200
or like go to youtube and learn things

577
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
so that you can kind of do things on

578
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,159
your own first of all or or determine

579
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
what your current skill level is as well

580
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,880
so

581
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
wanting to learn on your own

582
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,159
and watch a presentation there's

583
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,440
absolutely nothing wrong with that if

584
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
that's how you learn that's how you

585
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
learn

586
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
i agree so i don't have anything

587
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,520
audience if you have more questions

588
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
please send them in but i do have a

589
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
question here actually so you talk you

590
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,039
mentioned having mentors and you said

591
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,200
that deliberate practice makes your

592
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,960
progress visible so you've got these

593
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,360
check-in points with with this mentor

594
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
how do you keep that momentum going

595
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
between those visits because i imagine

596
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,440
they're not very regular

597
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
well i just started with this i just got

598
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
my cert like two weeks ago i guess now

599
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
so what we're doing is we meet via a

600
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,480
slack channel and

601
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,080
uh before we agree to meet again then

602
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
he'll he's gonna send me a report to

603
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,919
work on and then i'm gonna map it and

604
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,360
then send it to him before we meet up

605
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
and then we go over it together so it's

606
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
really about setting that next meeting

607
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,799
before we end

608
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,360
in that meeting

609
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,640
brilliant thank you very very much

610
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,840
alright audience i think that's our time

611
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,440
today what i'm going to do is

612
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
i'm going to post in this chat uh linked

613
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,039
to a survey so what we'd what we'd love

614
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,640
to have it's really helpful for dwayne

615
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,720

621

622
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,600
just to reiterate how can we get in

623
