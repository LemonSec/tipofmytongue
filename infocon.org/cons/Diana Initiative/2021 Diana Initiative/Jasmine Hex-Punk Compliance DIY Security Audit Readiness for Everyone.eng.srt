Punk Compliance: DIY Security Audit Readiness
for Everyone

00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:57,489
Jasmine Henry
>> Hi, Lea, thank you for the introduction.

3
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,760
And thank you, everybody, for being here.
I know that there's a lot of amazing talks

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,970
on the Diana Initiative schedule today. And
when given a choice, compliance is really

5
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,350
the most appealing option.
So, thank you for attending this talk. Thank

6
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,690
you to the organizers and thank you to our
sponsors as well. For helping us put on this

7
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:26,920
event. Who am I? I'm Jasmine Henry. I also
respond to Jasmine Hicks. I'm a security director

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,110
at a fast growing Seattle startup. We do not
have a security product so I'm not selling

9
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:40,710
anything. And I also am not claiming to speak
on behalf of the punk movement. I have identified

10
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,600
with counterculture movements since my teen
years. And I've always been somebody who has

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,890
not fit the mold or the standard. I think
that's something that many of us in security

12
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,800
have in common is having felt like an outsider.
And not only have I felt like an outsider

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,201
at times in my life to kind of mainstream
culture, I've also felt like a security industry

14
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:12,079
outsider at any points during my career. It
was really hard for me to break in. Just because

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,890
my pathway is not perfectly traditional. And
either am I.

16
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,450
I faced a lot of rejection. Especially early
in my career. Trying to break into security

17
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:34,488
roles. My undergraduate degree was not in
computer science. And I started off in help

18
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,970
desk. At the time I thought that I would never
get when I wanted to go. It was also 2010

19
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,989
so, the job market was terrible. But I really
felt like I'd failed. And I wish I had been

20
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,420
kinder to myself because I think that help
desk is a great launch pad for a lot of us.

21
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:02,880
I am mentored by an amazing woman CISO, CEO,
and she also started in help desk. And we

22
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,430
both agree that it is an amazing set of experiences
for security people. So, early in my career

23
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,750
I was rejected because I had literally zero
experience.

24
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:20,819
I got into project management. And I got a
master's degree in analytics next because

25
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:28,239
I was tired of hearing that I wasn't technical
enough. After that, I started doing more program

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,800
management. That's also the point in my career
where I started working a lot more with cloud

27
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,960
and DevOps and I did some consulting for a
few years. And I was often rejected because

28
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:51,050
I didn't have premises based networking experience.
And I've gamed it. I'm glad to tell you that

29
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:57,490
it gets easier as you gain more experience.
You face your rejections. And now I get a

30
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:03,150
lot of messages on LinkedIn and Twitter kind
of questioning my qualifications. But I think

31
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,560
that it just goes to show that there's always
gonna be trolls. And it's okay. You know?

32
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,820
So, I'm not a typical person. I don't fit
the mold. But I also drive exceptional results.

33
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,010
Last year I passed three compliance audits
in 6 months. I was hired last year as the

34
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:33,370
first US woman employee at a startup. We had
a little bit less than 40 staff at the time.

35
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:44,460
And several months later we were going to
sign a Fortune 500 customer. And we had to

36
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,780
put security policies and controls automation
into place in order to pass the risk assessment.

37
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,000
I think this is kind of a common pathway for
a lot of businesses and startups where compliance

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,410
and security are really customer driven. And
that's there a hesitation to invest in these

39
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,870
things before the customer is asking for it.
September was the turning point where my focus

40
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,900
fully shifted to security. Shoutout to Rin
Oliver by the way. We were working with each

41
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,840
other then and Rin handled that with a lot
of grace. Please don't miss Rin's keynote

42
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,590
tomorrow at 4:30. A couple months later, it
took the customer a couple months to review

43
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,739
our risk assessment and decide they were going
to sign us up and part of the contract said

44
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,740
that we had to pass three audits on a very
short period of time.

45
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,479
We had to be basically done with the audits
and submit reports by June 1st. So, we started

46
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,181
an audit really, really quickly and we dug
in. I was the only dedicated security and

47
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:55,421
compliance person at the organization at the
time. I had a lot of help. We have an amazing

48
00:05:55,421 --> 00:06:00,889
cloud and DevOps team. Amazing program managers,
amazing engineers. It turned out that we had

49
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:08,139
an employee who was a nationally award winning
pentester in college and high school. So,

50
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,030
he was able to do some pentesting for us,
you know? We made it work.

51
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,789
And in the past few months, my company has
had a series B funding round. And we're really

52
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:26,380
starting to scale. I'm creating a 24/7 SOC
currently. Really scaling controls. Creating

53
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:35,159
a 24/7 capacity for security support and growing
my program. The decision has been made that

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,780
security at my company is gonna own IT. So,
that's another area I'm building. And I'm

55
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:48,789
really excited.
But before I kind of get into talking about

56
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,300
what I've learned on this journey, and how
I am leveling up, I wanted to kind of create

57
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,139
some some definitions around security and
compliance.

58
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,479
Compliance is not security. And that maybe
the only thing that people on InfoSec Twitter

59
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:17,349
can agree on. Audits don't prove security.
Even the standards organizations will tell

60
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,300
you that compliance is a minimum set of security
requirements. Compliance is doing the bare

61
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:31,081
minimum. And that's that's, to paraphrase
the words of the PCI DSS council, compliance

62
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:36,809
is a really valuable business tool, however,
even though it's not the same as security.

63
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:43,750
In my case, I think that my compliance journey
this last year was pretty defining for my

64
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,060
career in security leadership. Which is something
I fought for a decade to achieve. It, you

65
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,331
know, kind of proved me to future hiring managers
and it proved me within my organization. It

66
00:07:55,331 --> 00:08:05,850
was through that I was able to get head count
and own IT. And get funding for my program.

67
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,729
Which I think that security resources, hiring,
is something that's a huge challenge for people

68
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,719
at companies of any size.
Truth is that the security industry is under

69
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,789
resourced. There's no CISO in the world that
wants to get hacked. It's a matter of the

70
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,009
fact that fighting for ed had count is really
difficult for all of us because security is

71
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,620
often seen as a cost center. I'm working to
change that perception, which I'll talk about

72
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:40,750
a little bit later. But yes. Compliance is
really great business proof.

73
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,410
Compliance frameworks are also great for internal
decision making. Again, executives often want

74
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,529
to spend as little as they can on security.
And saying we need this to pass audits is

75
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:58,550
often a lot easier than saying, we need this
to manage risks. Many compliance frameworks

76
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,430
are pretty cut and dry and that's really valuable
for navigating these discussions. And finally,

77
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,660
this one's huge. I think for startups and
small business, compliance, it's an international

78
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,430
mark of security maturity. It doesn't say
that you're doing all the right things. But

79
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:23,500
it shows that you're doing some of them.
So, at my organization, it helped us when

80
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,070
the first enterprise customer and more after
that. I know that our investors looked at

81
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,660
our compliance reports when we got our series
B. And I think it's a real helpful tool for

82
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:46,459
small businesses.
That said, compliance frameworks, again, they're

83
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,820
not the same thing as best practice. There
can be a huge difference. And I think the

84
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,620
difference is getting bigger. Especially as
we've gone away from traditional networks

85
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:04,390
to distributed ways of working. Distributed
systems. Frameworks don't always reflect reality.

86
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:10,439
And at a lot of organizations, companies of
all sizes, that can create a huge challenge.

87
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,660
There's a recent Shinikuni study that says
that 99% of CISOs feel compliance is outdated

88
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:24,130
for the cloud landscape. And it's really challenging
because there's the need to kind of interpret

89
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,990
standards and scope systems that's way harder
than it's ever been. There is a desperate

90
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,190
need for compliance automation, which is a
field that's really popping.

91
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:44,570
And not only are we having to pass more audits,
it's harder to get there. And I think that

92
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,720
the industry desperately needs leaders who
know the difference between compliance and

93
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,620
best practice. And this is the important part.
We need leaders who have the courage to defend

94
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,370
going above and beyond compliance to executives.
And I'll talk a little bit about how I do

95
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,640
this as well.
You know, I think that for a lot of people

96
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,300
here, people who are in security, people who
are breaking into security, people who are

97
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,420
considering going into security, compliance
is probably going to be inevitable. There

98
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:21,649
was a huge shift back in I think it was 2008
in terms of compliance burdens. We can also

99
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:28,890
blame it on Enron. As well as recent hacks.
The compliance department at most organizations

100
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:35,060
is getting bigger. Even at companies like
mine. I'm not in a traditionally highly regulated

101
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:41,369
industry like finance or healthcare. Technology
vendors, software companies, which my company

102
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:48,350
is in that space, we're having to pass more
audits. So, the average CISO passes three

103
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,280
to six audits a year. According to the same
Shinikuni study. Most commonly high tech,

104
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,089
PCI DSS and SOC too. The cost of compliance
when you dig into the studies are absolutely

105
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:08,830
staggering. You know? Numbers vary wildly
depending on who you ask. I think the highest

106
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:16,460
figure I saw was a KPMG study that said it's
10% of operating costs or more for 21% of

107
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:23,020
businesses. We did not spend anywhere near
that much. Which sing important. But it is

108
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,610
still a huge operational burden. And last,
I think this one's also important. If your

109
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,600
organization is sells to businesses, essentially.
If your customers or other businesses, compliance

110
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,250
is increasingly going to be a cost of doing
business.

111
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:46,920
83% of organizations are investing in vendor
risk assessment. I don't want to name names.

112
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,040
But SolarWinds. I think that there has been
things in the security ecosystem. Especially

113
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,860
in the last year. That have made organizations
realize that they really need to be looking

114
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,459
into vendor risks. And that's why, you know,
these audit reports are a highly valuable

115
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:10,040
tool. Because it is one form of proof that
you can give your customers that you're doing

116
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,110
many of the right things. Or doing the bare
minimum.

117
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,980
And in my opinion, my unpopular opinion, compliance
is extremely punk. I think that compliance

118
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,980
is wildly misunderstood. It has a reputation
of being a checklist. It has a reputation

119
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,970
of being boring. I'm not claiming it's the
same as security. But I really feel that there

120
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:43,839
is some kind of resonance between compliance
and the punk ethos.

121
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,240
A interview with Rick Reese who is an amazing
West Coast artist who has a lot of kind of

122
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,140
counterculture and skateboard influenced art
summed up the idea better than I could. I'm

123
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:05,060
going to point to Rick Reese's words. Punk
is subversive in how it rejects commodification,

124
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,829
consumerism and corporate culture. In underground
music, there is a real DIY ethos. If nobody

125
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,730
is going to help me, I'll do it myself. We
speak truth to power. When we're not permitted

126
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,399
to speak, we hold up a mirror. That's why
I think countercultures are really the most

127
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,480
important agents of change. This is the crux
of my talk. I'm here to share my experience

128
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,959
as a security leader at a small business without
a huge compliance budget. Having to kind of

129
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:42,239
DIY compliance audits. And how I succeeded.
But I think that these these lessons are important

130
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,820
for everybody. Especially individuals who
have at points in their lives have felt like

131
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,150
they're on the periphery. Have felt that they
don't fit the mold. Have faced rejection.

132
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:59,949
I think that those of us who choose to not
fit molds or just don't, are important change

133
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:08,980
agents and that the industry desperately needs
us. I think that people who spark change are

134
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,769
what gives me hope for the future. And I think
that compliance is what it is.

135
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,709
But it can be an amazing business tool for
sparking change within an organization. And

136
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:30,819
growing support for security programs.
The first thing I learned, I feel like as

137
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,850
I became a security leader and started my
compliance journey, is that you cannot brute

138
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,810
force executive buy in. I think a lot of us
get to our first security leadership job because

139
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:47,630
we are detail oriented. We are analytical.
We work really hard to prove that we're analytical.

140
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,870
And we come to meetings, and we come to presentations
prepared with data analysis that we've spent

141
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:59,520
8 hours on. We have every industry and internal
statistic to prove our case possible. And

142
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,140
that is not always the most effective tactic,
especially if it's the only one you're using.

143
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,980
There is an amazing Gartner study annually
on CISO effectiveness that asks what are the

144
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,650
top CISOs doing differently than their peers.
And the most recent one said that the one

145
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:21,029
of the top five things that the effect security
leaders do differently is they invest a lot

146
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,839
of time and attention in building relationships
with executives. They meet three times as

147
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:35,660
often with executives. And they meet with
the the marketing and sales team.

148
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:43,649
I have learned to become better at nurturing
ideas. I plant a seed and I water it. I revisit

149
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,810
ideas with executives, and I really focus
on the relationships. And I've learned to

150
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:55,989
create kind of shared interests around common
goals to create support for security in order

151
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,810
to have the budget that I need and the head
count that I need.

152
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,799
I do work closely with our marketing team.
I'm a SME for our marketing team on security

153
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:12,550
and compliance and privacy. And operating
systems and a couple other things as well.

154
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,079
But I collaborate with them, and I help them.
I help them create resources. And they they

155
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,959
help generate internal and external support
for my efforts with press releases about passing

156
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:31,919
audits and security whitepapers and security
website pages. Marketing is a critical relationship

157
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,159
for me within my organization.
I am have always worked closely with our sales

158
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:43,440
team. And in a couple weeks I'm going to do
a training for all of our sales representatives

159
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,200
so that they can sell security. We're gonna
talk about, you know, when during the sales

160
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,379
cycle should you bring up security. There's
evidence that somehow should be down it sooner.

161
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:57,570
How you handle vendor risk assessment requests?
What are the benefits of our product and product

162
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:05,418
features? What are ways that you can upsell
customers on security? I think that's super

163
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:10,609
valuable. Because that allows me in the future
to say, hey, security was a huge part of these

164
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:18,019
deals. I'm not just a cost center. And that's
probably the most important one of the most

165
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:23,019
important things I can do to get the funding
that I need for my program to do security

166
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:32,359
right. Because revenue really matters to executives.
Something else I've done with the, you know,

167
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:39,149
the sales team like I mentioned is I worked
with our rev Ops leader to figure out which

168
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:45,610
of our deals security played a role in in
our audit reports. Right now 20% of our enterprise

169
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,758
customers, or 20% of our revenue, depends
on successful compliance. And that is a stat

170
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,249
I can bring up in these executive meetings,
you know, if there's ever a question of what

171
00:18:55,249 --> 00:19:00,299
value I'm adding. It's a lot. It's a lot of
revenue. It's a contractual obligation to

172
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:07,029
these customers and I think that that's that
was a really important relationship for me

173
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:13,139
for sure.
Something else we've noticed just really quickly

174
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:20,850
is that the customers that are asking about
security are often the customers that we want.

175
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:27,279
I think there's often a Chang challenge where,
you know, not every organization is aware

176
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,350
of security, you know, in this kind of business
to business space. And so, that means you

177
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,799
can educate them. That involves working with
the marketing and sales team again. But you

178
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:45,710
can also learn how to attract the customers
that are ready to have those security discussions.

179
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:53,309
So, again data is not everything when it comes
to winning executive buy in. It is important.

180
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,850
So are relationships. But something I'm doing
is measuring compliance and security using

181
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,090
shared metrics. Metrics that matter to other
leaders in my organization.

182
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,279
Again, I've calculated the ROI of compliance.
I was able to say, you know, here's a super

183
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,509
specific point in time when we broke even
on our audits. Now we're making money off

184
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:20,359
our audits, we're making money off security.
I'm not a cost center. That is a really important

185
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:29,330
kind of metric that I know I worked with RevOps
to define. Something I measure, I try to measure

186
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:35,799
once a month is I use the CIS critical controls
to honestly assess our maturity. And through

187
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,908
that, I was able to finally prove the fact
that our first audit cycle improved our maturity

188
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:48,970
by 30% according to CIS critical controls.
Here's what we need to do next. I think there's

189
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:56,019
a lot of different ways to measure it. For
us, CIS controls is one of the tools that

190
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:02,529
makes sense. We also use OWASP SAMMS, which
is a fantastic tool for benchmarking security

191
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:09,890
maturity. And through a, I'm able show, you
know, here's here's what we've done. Here's

192
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,190
what all the people who are helping with the
audits have voluntarily done to improve our

193
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:24,289
security posture.
If I have hiring needs, as always, I use the

194
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:31,639
same kind of OS, and critical controls tools
to demonstrate how, you know, if we hire this

195
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:37,238
person, this is how it's going impact our
maturity and risk. And I use similar calculations

196
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:43,870
if I'm asking for an expensive piece of software.
Here is how it's going impact risk and security.

197
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:51,408
And I will often show as well, you know, here's
what we could be spending.

198
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:56,450
Another thing I learned is that you can't
force an engineer to do anything. At any company

199
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,109
of any size, compliance is gonna involve a
lot of people. It's gonna involve a lot of

200
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:05,620
collaboration. You're gonna need evidence
to submit to the auditor from the HR team,

201
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:15,500
from the engineering product DevOps teams.
Executives as well. So, in order to be audit

202
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:25,580
ready, you need buy in. And it's really not
wise to force it. You know, I have more authority

203
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,168
than I did at the beginning of my audit journey.
But I don't think that exerting, kind of flexing

204
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:37,169
that muscle of you have to do this, is the
best way to get anything done. I think that

205
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:42,529
it is more effective to lead my influence.
We have not we're not process of formally

206
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:49,149
appointing team champions. But this is something
you can do informally if you don't have that

207
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:55,039
go ahead. Is understand who within each function
at your organization is gonna champion for

208
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,139
you. And really foster those relationships.
Promote shared interests. Again, know how

209
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:07,668
security matters to sales. And make sure they
have the sales enablement tools, the brochures,

210
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:14,259
you know, the FAQs, to sell, you know, your
security benefits. Because that benefits you

211
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:21,179
because you can prove revenue impact. Communicate
value that matters to others. I think that

212
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:28,479
we need all types of individuals in security.
But we really need people who can community.

213
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:34,729
Communicate in terms that matter to the audience.
And communicate to different audiences.

214
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:41,090
Build trust. I think that every security and
compliance leader needs to build trust. But

215
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:48,459
if you're trying to, you know, DIY an audit
cycle on a tight budget, you really need trust.

216
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,859
My organization, a lot of our engineers come
from open source backgrounds. Because we're

217
00:23:54,859 --> 00:24:01,580
in the Android space. A lot of them grew up
on OWASP SAMMs and other OSS projects. And

218
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,658
what that means is that privacy really matters.
It matters to me, and it matters to my engineers.

219
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:15,289
So, I've chosen to be aggressively transparent
about controls and the fact that I intend

220
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:22,960
long term to defend employee and customer
privacy rights. And that actually was a huge

221
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,340
way that I won buy in and trust was being
really, really transparent about my short

222
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:36,590
and longer term, you know, data collection
activities within the context of monitoring.

223
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:43,080
And my privacy values as well.
A fourth thing that I think is a valuable

224
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,389
tool for leading by influence is advocating
for others at all levels of the organization.

225
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:54,620
You're gonna have a lot of tasks that you
need to do to pass an audit. And you can do

226
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,748
them yourself, which I did plenty of. And
you can also delegate. And I think it's really

227
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:10,480
important to consider whether there's opportunities
to get delegate to kind of junior employees.

228
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,969
Maybe recent grads, maybe other people in
kind of junior roles. Is there something you

229
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:23,649
can assign to people that is an opportunity
for them to have a high visibility win? That

230
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:28,610
was a really effective tactic for me. And
I think it's an important way to build security

231
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,379
and compliance experience internally. And
enabled others to get that experience, that

232
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:38,509
on the job experience that you yourself early
in your career needed. And had a hard time

233
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:45,989
getting. You know? Thing many of us faced
a lot of gatekeeping. And it is our responsibility

234
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:54,090
to remove barriers for others. And it's really
great that it also helps you pass audits.

235
00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:00,978
InnerSource is the best source. There is a
ton of documentation involved in audits. And

236
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:07,009
I have been working and will continue to work
to build an InnerSource culture of documentation.

237
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:14,120
The term "InnerSource" was coined by Tim O'Reilly.
It means using open source paradigms for internal

238
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,350
processes. Open source is something that's
super familiar to a lot of our engineers.

239
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,080
So, I think it was a good cultural fit. And
it was also a necessity for us to pass audits

240
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:34,230
quickly. I think that our InnerSource documentation
practice has some work to do to become mature.

241
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,359
But it was it was what we did because we were
resource strapped. We were growing fast, and

242
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:43,678
we had a global team as well. So, we established
a hub for policies and SOPs. For us, we used

243
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,941
Confluence as our Wiki. Removed barriers for
contribution to all. We brought up in kind

244
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:55,980
of the monthly All Hands meeting that everybody
was invited to participate in this policy

245
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:02,239
process. These policies need to work for all
of us. You know? A policy was never presented

246
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:07,260
as a top down thing. And I don't think it
should be. I think that policy should be a

247
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,509
collective effort to figure out where you
need controls.

248
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:20,529
And, you know, there's also an effort of matching
your controls to audit frameworks. I am transparent

249
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:25,809
about decision making. That's a huge part
of, you know, InnerSource policy culture.

250
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:35,970
I will often share kind of v1 proposed things
and collect feedback. I wish I got more feedback,

251
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,450
but getting some is a win. And I put in every
effort I can to reward people who contribute

252
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,309
to documentation. I don't think anybody's
ever thought it was easy to get engineers

253
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:54,210
to document their standard operating procedures.
And things like that. But if you've got a

254
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:01,120
healthy, inclusive policy culture, it is easier
for sure.

255
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,168
Recognition and reward is a huge part of effective
leadership. Especially if you're trying to

256
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:17,899
do audits on a budget. Cause, again, you need
voluntary and cross functional support. I

257
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:23,178
think that any compliance budget, no matter
how big or small, and security budget, needs

258
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:27,859
funds for rewarding team members who are not,
you know, don't have security in their job

259
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:35,230
title. If they're helping security, try to
make room in your budget for, you know, gift

260
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:42,489
cards, courses, other rewards. And be public
about how you recognize people who have taken

261
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:49,009
action, added value and created an impact.
Sorry.

262
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:56,909
I make sometime for recognition in security
meetings. But I've also made a point of getting

263
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:02,409
time in our All Hands meetings with the whole
company. And I use Slack as well to really

264
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:10,629
make sure that I am recognizing people in
public on internally in public. try to make

265
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:17,359
a point of spotlighting people who have, you
know, exhibited great security behaviors.

266
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:23,489
Behaviors who are helping us on our audit
journey. And I'm really loud. You know? We

267
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:28,929
have shoutouts every Friday. I have a lot
of shoutouts. I think that it is important

268
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:35,070
to have gratitude for others. And, again,
you know, recognize people who are contributing

269
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:46,580
voluntarily. And have really, you know, stepped
up and made impact.

270
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:54,080
Communicate constantly. I don't think any
executive ever has complained about the fact

271
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,989
that they are too up to date on a project
status. So, regular compliance project updates

272
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:06,210
and security updates are really important.
Especially if you're kind of in a high risk

273
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:13,179
scenario where you have a tight budget, a
tight timeline, something like that.

274
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:18,749
I think that, you know, kind of weekly updates
perhaps for different audiences, executives,

275
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:24,000
leadership, company wide should be at the
core of kind of a compliance communications

276
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,210
strategy. And even before you kick off your
compliance project and assign tasks out in

277
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:36,379
JIRA and stuff like that, start creating conversations
with individuals from all teams at all levels

278
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:42,070
of the organization. Start talking about your
unified vision for security. How privacy matters

279
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:48,009
to you long term. How you have a vision for
security never being a tool that gets in people's

280
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:52,629
way, you know? Enabling silent security in
every scenario possible. Start having those

281
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:58,509
conversations and define the vision for your
program.

282
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:03,119
Impact of compliance is a huge thing to have
conversations about. Talk about shared values.

283
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,769
You know? Again for me, I brought up earlier
that privacy is something that really matters

284
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:15,580
to a lot of our teams. So, talk about ways
that your vision aligns with the vision of

285
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:22,529
other teams. Automation is another thing that
is a shared value for me and other technical

286
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:26,820
leaders.
And then finally, you know, just be really

287
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,999
transparent about audit deliverables. Give
people opportunities to step up and take on

288
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:42,820
tasks. And be and giving them the opportunity
to own something. And have impact. I think

289
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,279
that a lot of us got to where we are because
we were given opportunities to take on projects.

290
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:54,571
And do things. People trusted us. And as a
leader, whether or not you have leader in

291
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:59,080
your job title, I think it's really important
to do that for others.

292
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:11,749
Lesson 7, again, not selling anything. There
is a lot of open source and premium tools

293
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:17,220
for compliance. Which is really helpful if
you're on a budget. And I think that for all

294
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,330
of us, building out compliance is it's a question
of, you know, what do I want to invest in

295
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:29,369
now? You know, where does investment have
the impact? You know, where is open source

296
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:34,529
a good long term solution? And if I can't
afford to cover this, these control areas

297
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:40,680
with the tool I really want, what can I put
in place that is compliant, it is secure,

298
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,609
and it's not too painful to rip out? I've
used many of the tools on this list. Some

299
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:54,189
of which I source from amazing blog by Jupiter
One. And there's others I have not used and

300
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:01,749
it's a couple of different free things you
can use. Jupiter One is one of several organizations

301
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:08,899
that has a GitHub full of security policies
that you can take and adapt to your organization

302
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:14,549
to pass audits if you don't have a dedicated
compliance team. I'm actually pretty new to

303
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:22,131
discovering Google vSEC. But it's a tool for
you to do assessment on your vendors. Risk

304
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:27,619
assessments. Which is super awesome. I do
not use Wizer Training. I'm aware of it. It's

305
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:35,990
a way to do security training. Communication
should involve a lot of different communication

306
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:49,600
styles. Socio, Wizer is a valuable free tool
in the context of other things. Some of our

307
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,509
HR and administrative processes are handled
through Jira. We do onboarding through Jira

308
00:33:55,509 --> 00:34:04,200
service management, and IT and access requests.
Jira has a free version. For us, we're not

309
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,493
on a free version, we're definitely on a paid
version. But it was a tool that we could add

310
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:17,000
that didn't involve another piece of software
and cost. Netflix Stethoscope is something

311
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:28,960
I'm looking at. It's for device configuration
management. Super cool. Wireguard is a free

312
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,429
VPN. I have not looked into Netflix Dispatch.
I hope to do that just because I'm curious.

313
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:45,080
Bitbucket has a free analysis. Snyk is an
analysis tool with a free version as well.

314
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:53,279
App threat Terraform. All the Amazon tools
for cloud security vulnerability monitoring

315
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:59,640
have free versions to a point. You may need
more than free to pass your audits. But it's

316
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:09,819
a free option to see if they work. We use
hacker guardian is the cheapest that's validated

317
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:23,549
bit PCI DSS council. So, it's an option.
And just kind of, you know, to sum things

318
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:29,420
up, I think that compliance is not necessarily
the goal for many of us. You know? We don't

319
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,039
embark on our security careers or start to
embark on security careers because we really

320
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,440
want to do governance, risk and compliance.
Not all of us. But we end up doing it. And

321
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,930
I think that it can be a really positive thing
because, again, compliance can be a tool for

322
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:51,598
sparking change. And those of us who didn't
always fit the mold are amazing change agents.

323
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:57,130
If I had one request it would be that all
of us in the security industry try to stop

324
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,770
saying that things are technical or not technical.
It's not a binary evaluation system and I

325
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:07,820
don't think it's the most effective evaluation
system. You know? Even when I was in a computer

326
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:14,710
science graduate program, as a woman I faced
a lot of times when I was labeled as not technical

327
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:21,951
enough. Or assumed that I was not technical
enough. And not only that was not true, it's

328
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:28,010
just not helpful. And I think that as we get
to the point in our careers where we have

329
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:34,230
a platform, we have, you know, initiatives,
we have budget. We have a responsibility to

330
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,490
stop labeling others or creating, you know
being gatekeepers by saying that people and

331
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,029
things are not technical. Because that's just
not helpful. Governance, risk and compliance

332
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:52,250
has a reputation of not being a technical
security domain. And it's really not true

333
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:58,849
now that we're trying to scale these kind
of outdated frameworks to our mature DevOps

334
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:05,700
and cloud programs. You know, automation and
controls automation is playing a increasingly

335
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,410
important role in compliance strategies. It's
the only way you can do it when you have these

336
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,230
massive and dynamic cloud environments.
So, I think that this is important to stop

337
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,410
judging, you know, compliance and compliance
people as non technical because it's increasingly

338
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:30,299
not true. And that does not go to say that
people who don't have a background in coding

339
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:34,788
have no role in compliance. Because we desperately
need people who can communicate and document

340
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:42,319
and lead programs and influence and do things
like that.

341
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:48,099
Saying a person is technical does not measure
their impact. And often, effective security

342
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:55,180
and compliance leaders are people who have
impact in different ways. Almost everybody

343
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:02,368
in security leadership roles is a masterful
communicator. Or they probably need to be.

344
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:09,069
You know, again, there is a a need for people
who advocate for others. Who commit to stopping

345
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:15,500
the security industry's gatekeeping problem
as much as they can. You know, I do not have

346
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,369
the same hiring budget by a long shot as people
at much larger organizations. I have a limited

347
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:27,410
number of hires I can make. But I can make
small change even within that tiny head count,

348
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:35,399
you know? I'm currently hiring for a role
that is a security support position to help

349
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,019
people who are in help desk achieve a SOC
analyst role. You know, even if you don't

350
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:46,731
have a huge hiring budget, I think there's
some room to create apprenticeships, give

351
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:54,370
people experience. Things like that. And at
larger organizations, you have the privilege

352
00:38:54,370 --> 00:39:01,400
to make much larger change. And that's something
we can all do.

353
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,900
Effective leaders are relentless about how
they set priorities. If you're doing a budget

354
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:12,210
with you're doing an audit cycle with not
enough budget and resources, priorities are

355
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:18,020
gonna be huge. We need people who are agile.
And we need people who can learn. Learn in

356
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:25,200
real time and help others learn. I think that
Carlota Sage spoke to that this morning in

357
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:34,710
a teen village panel. That knowledge management
is huge. It's about resources and documenting.

358
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:42,320
Documenting in ways that work for others.
And often being kind of an interpreter to

359
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:50,079
help others around you understand as well.
Speaking directly to people who are in security

360
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,980
leadership roles and people who aspire to
them, I think that we have some particular

361
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:04,180
responsibilities. I think that we should see
compliance for what it is. And understand

362
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:09,740
that it's a valuable business tool for sparking
change. I understand that compliance is not

363
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,078
everything my organization needs to be doing
for security by a long shot. But compliance

364
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,519
has been a really helpful tool for getting
the budget and resources I need for security

365
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:25,069
and making security maturity progress. You
know, have the courage to educate yourselves

366
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:30,080
and others on best practices. Have those conversations
with your leadership team. Here's what we

367
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,279
need to do for compliance. Here's what we
should be doing. Educate people in your organization

368
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:44,821
on the difference between security and compliance.
And even more importantly, become a SME. Become

369
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:54,880
a public interest technologist. Join special
interest groups or SIGs. And help create a

370
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,000
next generation of standards that are more
in line with best practices for cloud and

371
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,990
multi cloud environments.
There is no shame in using compliance, you

372
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:12,828
know, as an internal tool for winning buy
in. That's, I think, a highly effect tactic

373
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:22,680
in a resource strapped security industry.
You know, create better open source culture

374
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,490
for compliance so that compliance is not a
barrier to success for small organizations

375
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:34,020
and startups. There is a growing culture of
people who are sharing policy templates, compliance

376
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:41,440
templates, on GitHub. And creating kind of
an open source culture around that. I think

377
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,009
that, you know, if you're taking anything
open source, whether it's code or a template,

378
00:41:46,009 --> 00:41:50,269
you should always validate whether it's, you
know, effective and there's ways to do that.

379
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:56,129
But I'm here for creating a better open source
compliance culture.

380
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,900
And again, you know, give opportunities to
others. You're going to need a lot of help

381
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:10,319
to pass your audits and it is an opportunity
to break down barriers. Really quickly, if

382
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,869
you aspire to security or are considering
a career in governance, risk and compliance,

383
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:22,470
don't give up. You know, don't change yourself
to fit anybody's mold. I'm a security director

384
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:30,069
who does public speaker and I have a neck
tattoo. I'm a first generation college graduate.

385
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:34,340
And I'm here. So, I think that the security
industry needs all types. And that those of

386
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:42,009
us who have had different backgrounds and
think differently are effective change agents.

387
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:46,660
If there was one thing I could change about
my early career, I wish I was not so hard

388
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:57,240
on myself. I was building valuable experience
in help desk and database analyst positions.

389
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,508
And I also wish that I thought a little bit
differently about breaking into security.

390
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:11,450
Five years ago cloud wasn't considered security
work. DevOps who is here to define exactly

391
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:20,558
what security is or isn't? Other than the
sys main domains. I think security involves

392
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,470
a lot of job titles that don't have security
in them. And I think we should all be appreciative

393
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,660
of ourselves and the fact that we're building
experience.

394
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:37,069
And there are ways, it is not as easy to build
GRC experience outside a job as it is perhaps

395
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:43,829
for, you know, pentest your team. But there
are ways. Volunteer, get yourself in the local

396
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:51,859
chapter of OWASP. Open source projects. That's
huge. A ton of documentation and process and

397
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:55,840
compliance and audits, that's something you're
going to build in open source projects. As

398
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,900
a hiring manager, I specifically look for
people coming from open source bang grounds

399
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:06,349
even if it's nothing to do with our organization
or product. They can work in global teams

400
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:16,500
using asynchronous processes and mentor others.
And have a community mindset. Learn Git. Learning

401
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:24,329
Git does not involve any code. But I think
it is it is a valuable tool for pretty much

402
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:31,710
any security professional. Get a free GitHub
account. Build a portfolio on there. You can

403
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:38,510
create templates. And upload those to your
GitHub. Carlota Sage taught me that. That's

404
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:44,210
super valuable. Write. You don't need to write
poetry. Don't need to write huge technical

405
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:51,869
papers and get them published. But work on
your writing skulls and communicate effectively

406
00:44:51,869 --> 00:45:00,370
to different audiences. There's a lot of different
ways to do that. Any questions?

407
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:08,538
LEA: Yeah. We actually had a couple people
post questions during. So, I'm going to go

408
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:14,349
ahead and read the first one to you. There
are quite a few companies coming out with

409
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,789
compliance solutions. Are you looking at some
of these? And if so, do they look like they

410
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:22,490
will help?
JASMINE: Sure. So, I do have strong opinions

411
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:29,720
on that. And when I was putting together this
presentation, I really tried to be as agnostic

412
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,230
toward any paid solutions as possible. I'm
not trying to sell anything. I think a lot

413
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:41,619
of compliance is process and people in leadership.
And that matters more in, you know, in the

414
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:47,190
real world than paid tools. That said, we
do use a compliance automation solution that

415
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:57,069
I am extraordinarily happy with. Like love.
It's called Jupiter one, it's a sophisticated

416
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:06,430
cloud inventory tool and I compared it to
a lot of different things. And I love talking

417
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:13,660
about compliance software. Email me, hit me
up on Twitter, LinkedIn, and ask me questions.

418
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:19,759
Let's talk. Great question.
LEA: Nice. The next question that came in

419
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:28,710
during was, any advice for a customer defrauded
by a rogue actor internal to a massive corporation

420
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:34,829
who needs to get the audit committee of said
Corp. to take them seriously?

421
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:43,050
JASMINE: I don't know that I actually I apologize.
Could you possibly share the text that have

422
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,190
over Slack, so I pick sure I understand?
LEA: Yeah. I can do that.

423
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,630
JASMINE: Thanks so much.
LEA: Yeah.

424
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:54,200
JASMINE: I'm pretty sure I have never been
in that situation personally.

425
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,631
LEA: Did you get the Slack?
JASMINE: I did. Yeah. I'm looking at it right

426
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:09,579
now. Thank you. That sounds like a really
challenging situation. I'm really, really

427
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:15,480
sorry that happened. I am not a lawyer. I
would probably, you know, if it's an issue

428
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:23,270
of fraud that you're dealing with from a vendor,
I would probably talk to your legal counsel.

429
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,060
Because they can dig into the specific contract
and relationship and give much better and

430
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,538
more prescriptive advice.
LEA: That's always good advice in my opinion.

431
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:38,690
Talk to legal. And the other question that
came in is, could you please explain more

432
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:47,460
about volunteering in standards organizations.
JASMINE: Sure. So, there's a lot of different

433
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:59,240
standards. Some of which are put together
by employees. PCI DSS, you know, has employees.

434
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:05,118
They also have industry subject matter experts.
So, there's different ways that standards

435
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:12,900
are put together. However, there is ways to
get involved with different standards organizations

436
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,630
with varying levels of experience. Joining
an OWASP chapter would be a great example

437
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:26,000
of that. And my mind just completely went
blank because I'm absolutely exhausted. But

438
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,029
there is yeah. There's different ways to do
that as well. OWASP SAMMS is another project

439
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:37,940
you can get involved in. It's basically software
development life cycle skirt. There's different

440
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:45,760
open source contribution positions you can
take with that. I am not totally sure if MITRE

441
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,990
has volunteer positions or just employees.
But I would look at different standards you're

442
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:57,000
interested in and figure out if they have
chapter meetings, if they have conferences,

443
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,240
if they have open source projects that you
can contribute to. As one, you know, way to

444
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:13,640
influence the future of of these standards.
LEA: Yeah. Totally. I don't see any additional

445
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:20,940
questions. Just the last call for questions.
And if not, please fill out the survey. Please

446
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,819
visit the expo hall because we're about to
go on break. And looking forward to seeing

447
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:30,799
everybody back on the stages I guess in just
over an hour. Thanks so much, Jasmine, really

448
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:33,141
appreciate it.
JASMINE: Thanks so much, Lea. Take care!

449
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:34,141
[Lunchtime!]
Next on stage 1 at 2 p.m. Pacific: Honey,

450
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:35,141
I m Home! (Customizing honeypots for fun and
profit!)

451
