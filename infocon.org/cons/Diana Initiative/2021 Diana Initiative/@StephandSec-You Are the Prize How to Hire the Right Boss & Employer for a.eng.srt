00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,840
career growth and search environments.
STEPHANIE:  

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,080
Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for attending 
my talk. Today I'm going to be talking about  

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:16,080
how you are the prize. How to hire your boss and 
employer for a more fulfilling career. But first  

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm going talk a little bit about myself. I have 
been in the tech industry for about 8 years now.  

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,000
8 years this summer, exactly. And I have been in 
the security industry or space for about 5 years.  

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,120
Two of those years I was doing support and 
the last three, a security practitioner.  

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,000
Before getting into security, I was in 
technical support, doing anything from  

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,080
Linux administration on a junior level to help 
desk to network administration. I've kind of  

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,039
touched a couple things in my career in tech.
In addition to that, what I do in my 9 to 5,  

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm a writer. I've written blog posts and 
articles for different people. I have tend to  

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,640
hung my hat on the writing thing for a long 
time. I'm a LinkedIn Learning instructor.  

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:16,480
I have a course out now on social engineering from 
my perspective. And I'm a podcaster. My current  

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:25,519
podcast his recently shut down. I love to do pod 
costs and love those interviews. I'm a speaker,  

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,200
as is evident by today. I'm a speaker and I 
have been doing this for the last couple years.  

21
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,399
And I'm a psychology enthusiast. I take a lot 
of time reading a lot of material and books  

22
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,760
on psychology subjects. It's a pet project of 
mine to accumulate as much information as possible  

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,960
because I feel like getting to note human beings 
and how they work definitely make life a lot  

24
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,560
easier when it comes to navigating this life.
So, that's little bit about me.  

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
Today we're gonna be talking about a few 
different things. We're gonna be addressing  

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,799
where we get it wrong when it comes to the job 
hunting and interviewing process. How we have  

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,880
certain problematic mindsets that could kind of 
deter us or remove us from our journey to job  

28
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,519
satisfaction. Then we're gonna dive into what you 
should before applying to a job period. The things  

29
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,920
that you should think about and address before you 
even reach out to different jobs for employment.  

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,519
We're gonna dive into the interview process, 
which is never fun, never a breeze. However there  

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,640
are some mind shifts that you can make that will 
make this a lot easier than you probably intend.  

32
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,880
And then we're gonna dive into a few 
resources that I have found very,  

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,600
very valuable on my own journey and things 
that you can take forward with when it comes  

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:56,959
to this process of hiring the right employer.
So, first, we are talking about where we went  

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,760
wrong. Before I go into this, I kind of want 
to talk about the inspiration for this talk.  

36
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,160
So, I've had over 20 interviews in the last 8 
years for nine different companies. I know. That's  

37
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,360
a whole lot. I definitely had a goal in mind 
when it came to my career and I like to hit  

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,920
the ground running which is why I definitely 
took my time to explore different companies,  

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,840
different environments and get to know myself 
better and who I was as a worker. But in this  

40
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,560
process, you kind of learn a lot about how things 
go naturally. And the mindset shifts that we all  

41
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,080
need to make in order to go through this a lot 
less painfully and a lot more confidently.
 

42
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,720
So, when I was in the interview process, 
I always had this anxious feeling of,  

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,920
will they pick me? Won't they pick me? 
Do thing I'm a viable or valid candidate?  

44
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,080
Are they excited about me as much as I'm excited 
about them? Always externally based. Always  

45
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,520
wondering if I were the right fit for the job.
So, after some time and after things that I will  

46
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,760
discuss today, some of them being mindset 
shifts, some of that being networking and  

47
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,400
meeting different people who kind of exposed 
you to different truths, I began to take my  

48
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,400
power back in the interviewing process. I began 
to think of things in a different light which  

49
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,159
is what I'll discuss today. And a lot of that 
is also attributed to meeting Keirsten Brager,  

50
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,640
who has also done a keynote two years ago 
I believe for The Diana Initiative. So,  

51
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,840
following in her footsteps. But she definitely 
taught me a lot about the interviewing process,  

52
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,799
how I should be myself, what I should tell 
myself, the affirmations I should give myself  

53
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,440
in order to move confidently and as confidently 
as others in this space tend to be.
 

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,600
So, all of these things kind of have informed 
my experience. And definitely has informed the  

55
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,920
way that I think about the interviewing 
process today. No matter how I stack up,  

56
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
no matter what skills I have or the years 
of experience I have or what certs I have,  

57
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,320
I definitely have a different mindset when it 
comes to considering myself in the space and I  

58
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,840
think that doing so helps you to be the perfect 
advocate for yourself in those spaces as well.
 

59
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,920
Interviews tend to be a very, very big shift 
in dynamic when it comes to authority level.  

60
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,920
So, sometimes we can get very intimidated, 
especially when we are anxious and just  

61
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,480
thinking about them picking us. And not really 
thinking about it the other way around.
 

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,359
So, this is the inspiration for this talk 
and why I decided it might be something  

63
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,720
that might be helpful to a lot of people.
So, in order to help me illustrate what I'm going  

64
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,000
to be talking about today, I am going to introduce 
a fictional character named Sage. Sage is going to  

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,120
help me illustrate the ways in which you can 
make these changes and the ways in which you can  

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,160
kind of understand better the concept 
that I'm going to be discussing today.  

67
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,479
So, who is Sage? What is she about? We're 
gonna get into that in the next slide.
 

68
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,320
So, Sage, right? This fictional character 
that I've come up with just for the purposes  

69
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,760
of this keynote. Sage has worked in 
cyber security for about 5 years now.  

70
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,600
And Sage hasn't had the best luck when it comes to 
roles. She keeps kind of brushing up against the  

71
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,640
same    the same feeling of, I don't know what's 
wrong with me or the roles I'm getting. But I'm  

72
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,039
just not satisfied at all. I feel like it's not a 
big fit    not a good fit. And she's kind of made  

73
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:52,080
a lot of mistakes in the hiring process and hiring 
the right boss and employer. So, at this point,  

74
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,159
Sage also has a very severe case of imposter 
syndrome and wants to move on to a new job. So,  

75
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,360
there's a couple things here that I think is 
familiar for all of us when it comes to job  

76
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,840
hunting. A lot of us are really eager to move into 
new spaces. There are some of us who are a little  

77
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,239
bit more chill when it comes to job hunting, but 
most of us, by the time we're looking for a job,  

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,600
we kind of want to get out as quick as possible.
So, Sage here is kind of worried because she feels  

79
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,400
like a fraud, like many of us feel. And so, she's 
kind of wondering what are my job prospects? What  

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,199
is this process going to be like? How do I get 
into a different position or a different company  

81
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,919
where I can experience higher job satisfaction? 
All of this is running through her head. So,  

82
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,000
I want you to keep Sage in mind because I'll be 
bringing her up throughout this presentation.
 

83
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,719
So, where do we get it wrong? Back 
to the major point of this section.  

84
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,520
So, I talked about mindsets before and what that 
would look like. And sometimes where we get it  

85
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,400
wrong is how we think or perceive the situation. 
So, when it comes to the job hunting or interview  

86
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,600
process, a lot of times we are operating from a 
survival mindset. So, like I was describing Sage  

87
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,320
is in a position where she has imposter syndrome, 
she doesn't really feel confident in her ability  

88
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,520
to do what she has been paid to do this 
entire time. And she also has a severe case of  

89
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,439
   she also wants to move to a new job, sorry. She 
also wants to move to a new job and a new role,  

90
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,160
and she has outgrown the role. And we'll discuss 
later on the specific reasons. But all we know is  

91
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,719
she has a survival mindset. She's ready to go, 
ready to leave. There's another mindset that  

92
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
seems good on the nose, but if you dig a little 
deeper, it can be a little problematic depending  

93
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,320
how you are proceeding with this mindset. That is 
the ambitious mindset. When you think about that,  

94
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,440
you think about the overachiever, and we'll 
dive into that in a few slides as well.  

95
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Having a "Pick me" attitude. That phrase 
is coming up again. We're definitely going  

96
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,280
to be talking about that shortly. Focusing on the 
value we bring to the table before the interview.
 

97
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,680
So, a lot of this is important. And something 
that we have been taught. Everybody's been taught  

98
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:28,239
to look at the requirements and see where you fit. 
Everybody's been taught to stack themselves, their  

99
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,800
resume, against the requirements and see if that's 
even a thing. However, we all know there is some  

100
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,880
people who end up applying anyway and getting the 
position because a lot of job reqs tend to be wish  

101
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,200
lists. If we're being 100% honest. And 
so, another thing is imposter syndrome and  

102
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,360
lack of confidence. That definitely gets 
in the way of us confidently picking  

103
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,000
the right job environment for us moving forward 
and the right roles. And this GIF here as one  

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,280
of my top shows, Schitt's Creek. Here's it's 
talking about, you're clearly very desperate.  

105
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,400
And I feel like a lot of these mindsets, a 
lot of these things makes us come across at  

106
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,560
desperate which puts us in a position to be taken 
advantage of. And that's not a position of power  

107
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,920
and definitely not a position we want to be 
in when it comes to hiring the right boss.
 

108
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,960
So, the ambitious mindset. That is one of the 
mindsets that I mentioned in the previous slide.  

109
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,440
So, right here we are thinking about this 
lovely GIF on the left side where it talks about  

110
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,280
"I must achieve." Like this person is a 
show stopper, overachiever, definitely  

111
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,000
goal oriented. They're joining the company for a 
specific reasoning and nothing other than that.  

112
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,960
Any job at any pay as long as it's aligned with 
their goals. The problem with this is there's a  

113
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,360
potential for some sort of disappointment.
Sometimes you may overachieve. You may work  

114
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,520
very hard and then realize that there's no 
promotion path. Or they restructured everything  

115
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,040
in the department, and you are no longer in line 
for the promotion or the job that you wanted.  

116
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
Or they outsource an entire department. These 
are things that have actually happened to me.  

117
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,119
And you end up having no path at all forward and 
your job is pretty much rendered a dead end job.  

118
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,560
So, when you go into it only thinking about the 
end in mind, I think it tends to create a problem,  

119
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,400
because, yeah, you might ignore a whole bunch 
of stuff to get where you're going because  

120
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,079
you're thinking of the end in mind. But you 
end up burning yourself out because of this.  

121
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,400
And burn out does not help for anything. We 
end up working worse. Our mood is affected,  

122
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,240
the people around us are affected. So, it's 
definitely not something that we want to do.
 

123
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Also, the ambitious mindset kind of still has 
a "Pick me" attitude even though it's kind  

124
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,600
of manifesting differently than the survival 
mindset. You're definitely still wanting to be  

125
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,440
picked. You do extra things, pick up extra shifts, 
volunteer for extra things because you want people  

126
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,400
to notice. You want to look good, and you want 
people to put you up for different promotions  

127
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,000
and jobs and things like that. So, the ambitious 
mindset is a great mindset to have. I would never  

128
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,840
tell anyone not to be ambitious. But it can 
cloud our judgment when it comes to hiring the  

129
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,240
right employer. We definitely have to keep that in 
check when it comes to looking for the right fit.
 

130
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:44,320
And then when we have the survival mindset. So, 
when it comes the survival mindset, Sage is in  

131
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,840
survival mode, which is I got to get out of here. 
I actually don't care where I go. I don't care  

132
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,800
about the specifics of the job I work. Sometimes 
you will do something completely different than  

133
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,520
you have ever done before because you need to get 
out. Whether that be a bad boss or a toxic work  

134
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:08,160
culture or no work/life balance. Or you're burnt 
out and there's no release or relief from that.  

135
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,160
There are so many reasons why you enter into a 
survival mindset. It could also be that people are  

136
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,959
leaving like flies, the workload is crazy. So many 
different reasons. When it comes to the survival  

137
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,760
mindset, it puts you in the mode of I got to get 
out of here and I got to get out of here fast.  

138
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,520
You're essentially running away from a job rather 
than running towards another job. At this point  

139
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,720
you're not operating in your best power either. 
And this is kind of worse because you are going to  

140
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,880
potentially put yourself in a really, really bad 
situation just because you're running away from  

141
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,360
a not so great work environment.
Now, of course, not talking specifically about  

142
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,640
situations where the environment is particularly 
abusive or harmful to you, only talking about  

143
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,240
environments where it's uncomfortable to work 
there and you would rather go into another one.  

144
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
This person also has a "Pick me" attitude.  

145
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,640
However, it's more like a save me attitude because 
you want to be saved from your work environment.
 

146
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,160
You are very, very over it. And I've also been 
there as well. I know a lot of us can relate.  

147
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,920
And at this point, you will take anything. And 
so, because of that, you end up giving a lot  

148
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,520
of leverage to the interviewer and probably 
ending up less happy than you were before.
 

149
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,680
So, this pick me, pick me attitude that I have 
been talking about. I wanted to dive into that  

150
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,280
a little deeper as well. When it comes to this 
pick me attitude, it's all about what can I offer?  

151
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,120
You know, what can I offer them? How do stack up 
to them? How do they see me? It's a lot of anxious  

152
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,080
and nervous energy. You're going in kind of with 
kind you have like a desperation clouding over  

153
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:08,480
you. And also, clouding your judgment. You end up 
missing red flags because you're not listening for  

154
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,400
them. You're more concerned about how do I look 
to you rather than how do you look back to me?
 

155
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:23,040
And it's just this sense of, I'm not the prize. 
The job is the prize. Which the job is the prize,  

156
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
but I think what we're talking about here and 
what we're going to discuss here is how to make  

157
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
that equal. The job is the prize and so are you. 
So, this is kind of a very dangerous mindset, just  

158
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,760
like the other ones. It accompanies both mindsets 
and just something that we want to make sure that  

159
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:50,160
we are not engaging in. So, keeping this in mind.
So, now we're diving into the portion of the talk  

160
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,280
where we talk about before you apply. 
Now, I will be very honest. The first  

161
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,560
four or five jobs that I've had in my industry 
I did not properly prepare from the mindset that  

162
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm talking about today. I mostly thought about 
what I would get out of the job in terms of the  

163
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,480
ambitious mindset and whether or not they would 
take me. So, I didn't do a lot of this prep for  

164
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,800
many jobs. And I ended up experiencing 
many difficulties as a result of that.
 

165
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,119
So today I'm really hoping that some of this hits 
home. One of the first things that you should do  

166
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,760
before you apply is reflect. You need to take some 
time thinking about certain questions that will  

167
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,320
help you narrow down the search, number one. 
And help you weed out any companies that just  

168
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,720
don't align with what you're thinking about. So, 
when you reflect, you think about past jobs, past  

169
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:52,240
bosses, past positions. And you ask yourself, what 
worked? What didn't work? And what was missing?
 

170
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,640
So, when you think about what worked, you have to 
really consider, okay. I liked aspects of the job,  

171
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
hopefully. We're hoping you actually liked 
something about the job. Think about those things  

172
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,320
you liked and why you liked them. Think about 
why they worked, if it was a flexible schedule,  

173
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,040
think about the purpose in your life that it 
brings. What doesn't work is very important  

174
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,600
and probably something you don't need to write 
down. You can probably rattle it off if you're in  

175
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,600
survival mindset. Which is I know what I didn't 
like. I know what I didn't want any more of or  

176
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,399
I know what I was struggling with. So, that's 
something to reflect on and take note of as well.  

177
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,200
And then what's missing. What was neither there, 
but you would like there? It wasn't at your  

178
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
current job or wasn't necessarily a pitfall, but 
it's something that you would like in general and  

179
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,760
something that you learned about or something that 
you just appreciate an employer moving forward.
 

180
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,560
So, once that reflecting is done and thinking 
about the past and really diving into  

181
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
what it is that's    what it is that    that 
you need to improve upon when it comes to this  

182
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,640
new job, getting clear on what your wants and 
needs are. So, this kind of surpasses what went  

183
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,520
wrong or what went right and what's missing. 
It's more about like in general what are your  

184
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,200
wants and needs as a person? What are your wants 
and needs in your career? And then really getting  

185
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
clear on what those things are so that you can 
find an environment that aligns with that.
 

186
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,920
And think about the career that you want. 
So, this kind of plays into the ambitious  

187
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,360
mindset. This is where it's a strength rather 
than a weakness. Think about the things that  

188
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,360
you want to accomplish in your career. Think 
about the direction that you want to go into.  

189
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,680
And this is another reason why survival mindset is 
dangerous because you are not taking any of this  

190
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,880
into account. You just need to leave. But there's 
a lot of things mentioned here that will help you  

191
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,040
determine what's a good fit moving forward and 
what isn't. When you walk into the interview  

192
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,399
process, you'll be completely clear because you've 
done this work. So, don't skip out on this.
 

193
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,040
So, here's some things to consider. And might 
be slightly outside of the scope of this talk.  

194
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,920
Meaning that I would want to spend a lot more time 
on it than I have today. But something to consider  

195
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,240
heavily when it comes to the    basically 
the journaling or the documenting of your  

196
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,480
past experiences is your mental health. You need 
to take into account where you are mentally. So,  

197
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,880
if you're severely burnt out, that's going to 
affect your work and you need to worry about  

198
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,720
recovery. A lot of people believe that once 
you leave the environment that burnt you out,  

199
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,040
that you will all of a sudden be cured and your 
burnout will immediately dissipate, and you'll  

200
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,159
be able to move on and go back to normal.
Unfortunately, I have some bad news for  

201
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,080
you. It doesn't work like that. Your body is not 
a machine. As much as we work with machines, you  

202
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,960
are not one. And because of that fact, there are 
just simple limitations that you will experience  

203
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,520
as a human being. And one of those is that it 
takes time to recover from burnout. Especially  

204
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:13,120
considering how long you were probably burnt out. 
So, when you take all that into account, mental  

205
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,959
health is something you really need to take time 
and assess yourself for. Not to say that if you're  

206
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,760
not in the best position that you can't work for 
someone else. That will be up to you and your  

207
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,240
doctor to determine. But to say, you'll be 
careful about the types of jobs you sign up for.  

208
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,280
If you know you're burnt out, going into a 
fast paced environment is probably going to  

209
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,000
lessen if not completely remove your recovery. 
And so, that's probably not the best fit for  

210
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,680
you at this time. You may want to consider that 
flow. If you have struggled a lot with depression  

211
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,200
and you've needed time away for whatever reason, 
you need to consider these thing when is it comes  

212
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,560
to the work environment kind of helping with those 
things. Do they offer mental health benefits?  

213
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,800
Do they have any kind of leave that you can 
take advantage of in case something happens?  

214
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Do they have good health insurance so that 
you'll be able to cover those things?
 

215
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,200
So, you have to think about it, of course, from 
a medical perspective as well. But mostly here  

216
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm thinking about where you are mentally. 
If you're having panic attacks all the time,  

217
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
you're having a lot of symptoms of burnout, you 
need to take that    you need to take that into  

218
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,280
consideration when it comes to looking for a 
new job and the right employer to move to next.
 

219
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,320
The next thing is your life goals. You really 
have to think about your personal goals.  

220
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,399
As much as we like to say that work is work and 
personal is personal and they don't mix, it's  

221
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:46,000
just not true. Again, we are human beings, and we 
are human beings who show up to work. And as such,  

222
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,200
we do need to consider our outside lives when it 
comes to choosing what our 9 to 5 is going to be.  

223
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:01,200
9 to 5 is 40 hours of every week. 40 hours. And 
you spend another eight times seven, so, 56 hours,  

224
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,440
sleeping. If you're getting the right sleep.  

225
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,040
And so, that doesn't leave a lot left in the day. 
Or in the week for you to do anything with. So,  

226
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,080
if you're gonna be spending 40 hours plus 
anywhere, you want to make sure that place aligns  

227
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,160
with your life goals in some way, shape or 
form. Whether that be work/life balance,  

228
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,440
compensation, benefits, proper career trajectory, 
any travel included, side work, you name it.  

229
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,720
Those things need to be factored in when 
it comes to this job search as well.
 

230
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,280
Who you are definitely matters. That will help 
you when it comes to conversations about culture,  

231
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,520
team fit. Those types of things. Even the way 
that you and your manager's relationship will be,  

232
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,560
learning who you are and taking stock of 
that and practicing self awareness about that  

233
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,200
will help you tremendously when it comes to 
understanding if the person you're talking to  

234
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,320
is a fit for you or if you're a fit for 
that environment or not. Trust me on this.
 

235
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,399
Also, your purpose. If you have one, I believe 
everyone has one. Whether chosen or you feel like  

236
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,720
it was some other calling. If you have one and 
it's tied to work, it's definitely important for  

237
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
you to take that into consideration when it comes 
to considering who your next employer is going to  

238
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,560
be. So, if I feel like I was meant to speak and 
I am talking to an employer who is not a fan  

239
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,840
of me speaking, that's going against 
what my purpose or calling is.
 

240
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,560
And therefore, is probably not the best 
fit. I will probably not be happy there  

241
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,919
over the long term. So, these are all things to 
consider when it comes to this process as well.  

242
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,560
But unfortunately I don't have time 
to dive deep into the examples of  

243
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
each of these. Just wanted to highlight them.
 

244
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:57,360
So, now we're back with Sage. Our example for 
this talk. So, this is Sage reflecting on the  

245
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,080
past. And I wanted to give some examples of what 
that looks like just in case you were kind of  

246
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,439
stuck or you hadn't considered certain things. Or 
to just get the juices flowing in terms of your  

247
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,560
brainstorming on these questions. Because 
they can be very big questions, especially  

248
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,639
when you're not happy at a position. All you 
can think of is what went wrong. You might not  

249
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,840
have any idea what went right. So, hopefully 
this will help. So, when it comes to what went  

250
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,199
well in her previous roles. She had a very 
flexible schedule, which she loved. She has a dog,  

251
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,160
so, she enjoys being able to sleep in a little 
bit, play around with her dog. Go into work,  

252
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,399
you know, do something, go back home. That kind of 
flexibility was definitely great for her. She had  

253
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,160
lots of autonomy. Which was very important to her 
because she's the type of person that can come in,  

254
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,480
be told the general idea and then take names. She 
doesn't need someone to hover and micromanage.  

255
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,040
And has had problems in the past with hovering 
and micromanaging. The environments with autonomy,  

256
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:06,080
she did her best work. And great benefits. Who 
doesn't enjoy that? She had great benefits at  

257
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,679
her previous employers. So, that's another 
thing that she experienced that went well.
 

258
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,280
Now, what went wrong for Sage is basically 
the fact that she had strained relationships  

259
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,760
with her boss. Particularly in the very last 
position that she left. There were lots of  

260
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:33,280
office politics which she is severely uninterested 
in that she felt forced to participate in.  

261
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,520
And then her position had no promotion path. 
Unfortunately for    fortunately for the company,  

262
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,960
I guess, and unfortunately for Sage, they ended up 
outsourcing the department she wanted to move into  

263
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,639
which rendered her promotion path basically 
void. So, that definitely puts a new stress  

264
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,320
on her ambition mindset. And had her 
eyes kind of darting towards the door.
 

265
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,800
So, when it came to what's missing, she basically 
assessed that she needed a higher salary based on  

266
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,560
what the market value for her position was. 
Definitely needed more of a training budget  

267
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,120
in positions because she hadn't experienced 
that before. But she knows that people were  

268
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,919
able to negotiate that. And leadership 
opportunities. You know? Sage has leadership  

269
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,120
ambitions. She definitely has leadership 
dreams, and she was not able to explore  

270
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,800
those opportunities while at her last role.
So, this is an example of what a reflection look  

271
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:38,320
like. Obviously, your list may be longer. I know 
my lists before have been very terribly long. When  

272
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,080
it comes to the what went wrong side. But also, 
working in tech, I think I've experienced a lot of  

273
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,600
what went well too in terms of just the stuff that 
we experience here in the industry. And what's  

274
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,800
missing? And I think that's an ever evolving 
list. Some days I have a conversation with a  

275
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,240
colleague or a friend in the industry and then 
I come up with another what's missing. So, these  

276
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,560
are examples of how you can do that process with 
yourself and what that would look like on paper.
 

277
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,639
So, when it comes to Sage's needs and wants. 
Right? We're breaking it down a little bit further  

278
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,720
so that she can identify what does she absolutely, 
absolutely need? And cannot do without. And what's  

279
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,960
more of a want. Something that she would like to 
have but isn't necessarily a deal breaker for her.  

280
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,640
And when she broke that down, she basically came 
up with this list. Education reimbursement. She  

281
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,480
would love to go and get her master's degree. 
But she is not 100% sure yet. Therefore,  

282
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,560
she doesn't hold it against companies 
if they don't have tuition reimbursement  

283
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:47,600
or any kind of education reimbursement.
She also would love remote work capabilities.  

284
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,760
Like I said, she has a dog. She's very 
excited about her dog. Very excited about  

285
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,960
time spent with her dog. And working from home 
sometimes helps her concentrate in ways that she  

286
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,840
might not be able to manage in the office. So, 
that's definitely something she wants from a job.  

287
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,800
Great company culture is super important to her. 
She wants to be able to be herself at all times  

288
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,840
and she wants that to be accepted.
So, she noticed that she thrives  

289
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,399
in a great company culture as well. And 
equity. She wants to be able to own a stake  

290
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,000
of the company that she joins. However, 
this list to the left is kind of like,  

291
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,640
hey. This is what I would like. So, anybody that 
has this would probably be at the top of my list.  

292
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,000
But if I'm getting down to crunch time, money's 
running out and I have to make a decision, then  

293
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,760
I wouldn't necessarily discount an opportunity 
because they don't have these things. Because  

294
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,000
you're not a tree. You can definitely move away 
from wherever you join if you need to. But you  

295
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,800
have to really assess all parts of the equation 
to be able to make that informed decision.
 

296
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,280
When it comes to her needs, they're a lot more 
ironclad, a lot more solid. Higher salary,  

297
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,840
she needs that. Great insurance. She has 
suffered burnout before. She wants to make  

298
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,480
sure there's support for her in the event that 
it happens again, depending on the way things go.  

299
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,200
Promotion path is a need because for her 
in an ambitious mindset, she definitely,  

300
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,160
definitely needs a lot of incentive to keep going, 
keep overachieving. And one of that is knowing  

301
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,840
that there is a path forward. Work/life balance, 
super important to her. She has a life outside  

302
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,360
of work and she wants to maintain that. Flexible 
schedule, like I mentioned before. Very important  

303
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:42,080
to her for multiple different reasons. One of them 
being her pup. And adequate PTO policy. Meaning  

304
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,639
that she has a number inside her head of what are 
appropriate amount of days to get off of a year.  

305
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,480
And will not budge on it. So, these are examples 
of what your wants and needs list might look like.  

306
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,920
For Sage this works for me. I need education 
reimbursement. I like to train. So, that's more  

307
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,520
important for me. But for Sage, she's like, 
that might not be that much important to me.  

308
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,840
So, depending on what your journey is with that, 
that will decide what your needs and wants to look  

309
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,399
like. Your list must    might be longer. It 
should be. Or shorter. Which I don't think so. But  

310
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,040
having this list definitely helps you 
when it comes to the interview process.
 

311
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,880
So, ultimately, what does Sage want out of a 
career? Which is the last section of reflecting or  

312
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:37,120
of kind of like getting clarity that you'll need 
to do. Sage long term wants to be a Chief Officer.  

313
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,239
She wants to be either a chief security officer 
or a chief information security officer. So,  

314
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,640
she wants to go all the way to the proverbial top. 
In the short term, she would like to be a manager  

315
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,960
or a lead. And for her here short term is anywhere 
in the next 5 years. And she wants to stay  

316
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,560
in cybersecurity. So, she is committed to this 
industry. Other career goals that she has, CISSP  

317
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,760
is a goal of hers. Master's degree is a tentative 
goal of hers. Contribute to an open source project  

318
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,000
and deliver a technical talk. Now, these are all 
typically common goals for people. Of course,  

319
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,240
depending on personality and values, some of 
these might not even be on your list. Some of  

320
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,360
these might. But they tend to be what I commonly 
hear in terms of what people have as goals.
 

321
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,640
And then she has her personal goals here. She 
wants to travel more and learn a new language.  

322
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,600
So, somehow that doesn't seem related to what 
she does in cybersecurity. But you honestly never  

323
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,000
know. You never know who will need what. And there 
are positions where you can travel. Where that's a  

324
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,760
regular part. Especially if you're in consulting 
or something like that. That's a regular. And,  

325
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:55,280
of course, the world is not currently undergoing a 
pandemic. Those things are things she can consider  

326
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,240
or think about when it comes to deciding which 
   what new employer is a great fit for her.  

327
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,480
Adding personal goals, though it seems unrelated. 
You just may never know what positions or  

328
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,840
what are opportunities pop up and what would align 
with your personal goals as well as your career  

329
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,360
goals. So, it's super important to consider 
this as you're moving along your process.
 

330
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,320
So, what is an interview? Before 
I say what this definition is,  

331
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,040
I want to explain myself. I definitely 
enjoy a good definition. I enjoy getting  

332
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,680
clarity on what a word means and especially in 
a conversation when introduced to a new word,  

333
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,640
I will immediately look it up to make sure you 
have a solid understanding what that word means.  

334
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,600
I love words. Such that it's only right that I 
have a definition here in my keynote. What is  

335
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:56,080
an interview? It is simply a meeting of people 
face to face, especially for a consultation.
 

336
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,560
I thought this definition was great. For multiple 
reasons. It is a meeting. So, something super cas.  

337
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,320
Meetings can be pretty formal, they can also 
be informal. But there's no distinction here  

338
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,040
whether it's formal or informal. Just that it's 
a meeting of people face to face in person. In  

339
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,080
these times sometimes face to face is through 
a machine. But especially for consultation.
 

340
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,759
So, I kind of like this definition because it 
talks about to from a perspective of consulting  

341
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,080
rather than a perspective of I'm up for 
judgment or I'm up to prove my worth.  

342
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,199
I'm consulting you and the job that you have 
available. And you're consulting me on if  

343
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,799
I'm a fit for that job. That's the exchange 
that happens in the interview process. So,  

344
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,120
before    so, I wanted to get that definition down 
before we dive into the next section of the talk  

345
00:34:53,120 --> 00:35:01,839
which discusses the interview process.
So, interview prep.  

346
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
When it comes to the interview process, it's 
super important to prep beforehand. A lot of  

347
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,760
us do it. Sometimes that means reading books 
on technical topics, making sure you brush up  

348
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,960
on subjects that are mentioned in the job rec 
requirements. A lot of different things. But  

349
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,360
people don't really talk about when it comes to 
looking at this from the lens of hiring your boss.  

350
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,400
You might have some different questions to write 
down. Some different prep activities to do before  

351
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,080
the test. I mean, before the interview. 
So, when it comes to the interview process,  

352
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,840
we tend to work or focus more on our technical 
aptitude or our technical ability to do the job.  

353
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,040
Which is a part of it. And definitely 
still should be a part of it.
 

354
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,759
But we should also pivot to what can this job do 
for me? And does it align with any of the things  

355
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,080
that I took the time to get clear on before this 
interview? So, the things that you should do,  

356
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,240
or things that you should add to your interview 
prep is writing down questions beforehand. We've  

357
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,640
all been told this. We've all been told this. At 
least I have a bunch of times from like college  

358
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,400
prep classes in high school until I don't even 
know, maybe a couple years ago, I've definitely  

359
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,040
heard, and I know everyone has heard is write 
down questions to take. However, the idea has  

360
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,040
always been write down a question to ask because 
it looks good. Not necessarily because it's  

361
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,080
some information that you need to make your own 
decision when it comes to you getting an offer.
 

362
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,120
So, I wanted to kind of call that out. Because 
I might have been the only one that didn't  

363
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,319
understand that. I could have. But with the 
conversations I've had, I don't think that I  

364
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,240
am. Some of us do not think about it from the 
perspective of, oh, wait. I've done this. I  

365
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,959
actually could ask questions that will help me 
know if this job is a good fit for me. And I  

366
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:00,240
will tell a story, actually, about the first time 
I ever prepared for an interview in this way.
 

367
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:08,799
I ended up going up for a security position. 
My second one ever. And at this point,  

368
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:20,320
I was exhausted. I was tired, exhausted, worn 
out by leaving jobs and having to do so regularly  

369
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,120
because I wasn't a fit for the environment. And 
I kind of am decisive about this kind of thing.  

370
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:34,080
So, at this point, I knew myself very well. 
I knew what I expected from a job very well.  

371
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,640
And I knew what would help me be a better worker, 
at least from what my failures had been. And I  

372
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,160
also knew what would contribute to burnout because 
I had already experienced burnout before getting  

373
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:55,359
into security. And I was uncompromising 
on what I wanted out of a job situation.
 

374
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,400
So, when I went into this interview process, I 
was very clear. I had done what I had just    what  

375
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,920
I've just told you and I really had taken stock of 
the ways that I was    I needed to improve on my  

376
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,480
own self as an IC. But also, I thought about the 
ways in which my job environment, my relationship  

377
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,600
with my boss, various different things, company 
culture. How that affected my trajectory as well  

378
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,160
and how that affected my experience as well 
and how that affected my job satisfaction.
 

379
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,200
So, given all of that, I took that, and I came 
into this interview. And I kind of didn't care  

380
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,160
whether they said yes or no. Whether they wanted 
me or not. I was, for the first time ever,  

381
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:44,160
more concerned with whether or not I wanted them. 
Whether or not I was interested in continuing  

382
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,160
this. And whether or not this is just going to 
be me repeating the same patterns that I had seen  

383
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,799
in the past because of my negligence when it came 
to picking a proper employer for me to work in.  

384
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,440
So, with that being said, these tips are 
definitely going to help because they've  

385
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,600
helped me so much. I have much higher job 
satisfaction than I've ever had before.  

386
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,839
And that's because of doing due diligence.
And also, of the processes that I discuss here  

387
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,160
in this next section. So, when it comes 
to interview prep. Writing down questions  

388
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,120
beforehand is definitely important. And making 
sure those questions come from what your wants,  

389
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:29,040
your needs are, the reflections that you made. 
And your career goals is    is pertinent.  

390
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Writing down red flags and non negotiables, 
also pertinent. It's    it's a different kind  

391
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,360
of energy when you're sitting in the room across 
from someone that is going to either be someone  

392
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,280
in your life for the next X amount of time, 
or someone you never talk to again. And so,  

393
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,320
you kind of feel awkward about certain things. 
You're on the wire. You might not remember  

394
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,040
what a red flag is and what your non negotiables 
are. Making sure it's written down, whether you  

395
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,680
consult it after the interview or right there in 
the interview is definitely something I would do.  

396
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,560
Update your resume, of course. This is a 
no brainer. You want to make sure it's up  

397
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,120
to date and has all the latest information. And do 
something that makes you feel confident. Honestly.  

398
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:19,120
I think for me I wore    I bought a new outfit. 
Because new outfits make me feel confident.  

399
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,560
Especially if I really enjoy the outfit. For me, 
I bought a new outfit. For you, if that's not  

400
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,600
something you're able to do. Maybe playing a game. 
Playing Assassin's Creed makes me feel confident  

401
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,520
depending on what missions I'm doing. Playing 
a video game, maybe talking to a friend that's  

402
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,920
a hype man. Whatever you need to do before 
the interview is important and it's going  

403
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,240
to feed into the energy you bring to the 
space when it is time for the interview.
 

404
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,880
So, here's how Sage's questions for the interview 
looks. What does an average day look like for  

405
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,760
someone in this role? I've asked this question 
many didn't times and it's very important to ask.  

406
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,080
Hopefully you also have skills into parsing 
through certain unsaid information. And what  

407
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:19,120
I mean by that is sometimes someone answers 
verbally one way, but there's other context  

408
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,480
available to you to understand the fullness 
of what they're trying to say to you. So, if  

409
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,680
the person is kind of saying, ah! An average day. 
Super, super breezy. There's absolutely no work.  

410
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,279
But their eyes are kind of shifting or 
they're kind of shuffling uncomfortably.  

411
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,640
They might not mean fully what they say. So, 
trying your best. Of course, don't make up  

412
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,879
story. But trying your best to understand body 
language and see how people answer the question  

413
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,680
is definitely important here. Because what the 
average day looks like is a peek into your life.
 

414
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,080
And when you think about that, when you 
think about the peek into your life,  

415
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,360
you must be very interested in what the answer is. 
If you're currently burnt out and they're saying  

416
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,520
that from the moment you open your eyes to the 
moment you close them at night, you are working.  

417
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,959
You're probably going to say, thank you. But no 
thank you at the same time. But if it's super  

418
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,480
simple work and very light but challenging 
sometimes. Or more balanced. Whatever the  

419
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,720
space may be. Whatever you need at that moment, 
definitely perk your ears up for that information  

420
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,959
because it helps you understand, is this a good 
fit or not? So, great question for an interview.
 

421
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,720
Another question is, what is something you love 
about working here? So, this gives people a  

422
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,759
good chance to highlight something amazing about 
where they work. And if somebody truly loves where  

423
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,760
they work, it will be super easy to answer that 
question. And what I liked about my current role,  

424
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,360
and this is me, Stephanie, not Sage, is that when 
I asked this question to one of my teammates,  

425
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:58,240
his eyes lit up. Actually lit up like    like 
it was Christmas. Which kind of showed me that,  

426
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,359
okay. This person really enjoys working here. 
Now, why is very    is something you have to  

427
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,120
figure out. But for whatever reason, they're 
very happy to be there and that's a good sign.  

428
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,080
So, definitely asking, what's something you 
love? And seeing how they react to that question  

429
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,640
and how they answer is definitely important.
But equally as important is, what's something  

430
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,240
you hate about working here? And I use the 
word "Hate" on purpose. I think people are very  

431
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,520
uncomfortable with that word. So, when I tend to 
use that word in interviews, it definitely shows  

432
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,480
me the reaction. Now, I want to say nine times 
out of ten folks pretty much respond and say,  

433
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,600
I wouldn't say necessarily hate. I would say I 
probably dislike... I've gotten a strong dislike  

434
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,640
once. But for the most part, they're not going to 
   typically people don't admit to deep disdain  

435
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,799
for something in the interview process 
when they're trying to incentivize you to  

436
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,200
join. But it give use a clearer picture. If 
they're kind of dodgy or say something vague,  

437
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,799
there's more to the story. If they answer 
directly or honestly and candidly and you  

438
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,880
can kind of tell, I think it helps so much 
with, okay. So, this person is number one,  

439
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,480
the environment that they're in doesn't make 
them scared to answer this question honestly.
 

440
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,280
But also, number two, this person is informing 
me about something that I wouldn't have found  

441
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,840
anywhere else. So, great, great things to ask.
Another thing to ask is, are there  

442
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,600
any opportunities for advancement or professional 
development? So for Sage, this is super important.  

443
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Because it's a non negotiable for her that she 
has somewhere with upward mobility. If there is  

444
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,480
no upward mobility, she is not interested, it 
doesn't work for her. She's already tried it.  

445
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,840
Got the T shirt. And decided to return it. So, for 
her, that's a very important question. And asking,  

446
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,240
I will say an experience that sometimes you have 
non committal answers of, yes. We definitely like  

447
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,479
to invest in our coworkers    I mean, employees. 
But no specifics to that. I think what I liked  

448
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,600
about my current position, they immediately told 
me about the plan for education, investment and  

449
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:18,319
professional development. It's definitely a topic 
of conversation, still is, surrounding my journey  

450
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,480
with my current company. So, definitely 
something important to ask. And the answer is  

451
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,080
super important here. And lastly, she has, can 
you tell me about who I will be working with?
 

452
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:36,480
Considering that I said 40 hours of the week 
will be spent with these individuals, it is so  

453
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,320
important for you to understand who they are, what 
they're like, what is the team like? How often do  

454
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,680
they get together? Specific questions about that. 
Once you get hired, you cannot change who your  

455
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,319
teammates are. You can kind of help, you know, 
ill wish that they end up leaving or something  

456
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,880
ends up happening. But that is pretty much a wish. 
You will be stuck working with this person for the  

457
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,640
duration of your time or their time. So, getting a 
peek into how that    what that looks like. Also,  

458
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,400
what is the load? Do I have a team of one? Do I 
have a team of ten? How much support will I have  

459
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,680
on a given basis? Definitely important because, 
again, you're considering other thing like mental  

460
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,399
health. You're considering life goals, et cetera. 
You can't have work/life balance if you're the  

461
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,760
only person doing a thing. It's just literally 
hard. I don't know a single person doing it.  

462
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,040
I have tried and failed. Knowing what the team is 
like, what the dynamics are, the size of the team,  

463
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:41,839
asking the questions and seeing the 
responses is definitely important here.
 

464
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:55,279
So, as it pertains to Sage's red flags. 
Sage is over work/life balance not being  

465
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,080
a thing. She really would not like to partake 
in that anymore. And schedule in flexibility.  

466
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,920
She's definitely not a fan of that. For her, she's 
just seen how it just ends up working horribly.  

467
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:15,520
And for me personally, I definitely have seen the 
psalm thing. I think when people are sticklers for  

468
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,160
a specific schedule, I tend to not flourish 
as well as when I'm allowed to come in when  

469
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,799
I am able to. And not to say that I just 
come in at 1 p.m. or anything like that.  

470
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,480
But more so having a flexibility of coming 
anywhere from 8:00 to 10:00 is a really great  

471
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,200
   a really great feature whether it comes it 
when you're creatively your best. When you're  

472
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,240
able to show up your best. And I show up my 
best a lot more often with that flexibility.
 

473
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,799
So, definitely important to consider for Sage 
as well. Probably for different reasons. I  

474
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:57,040
don't know. No training opportunities or upward 
mobility. So, for her, she might not be upset if  

475
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:05,200
you don't have any    any education reimbursement 
as identified in her wants. However, it's a red  

476
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,520
flag for her. If you're not investing in your 
employees, why? What is the purpose of it? Why is  

477
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,640
it just a transaction if I do this work and then 
you reward me by giving me a paycheck? What more  

478
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,200
do you need to invest in your employees or what 
is the reason for you not doing so? Definitely a  

479
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,120
question that needs to be asked, definitely a red 
flag. Maybe something that's not a deal breaker  

480
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:32,400
at the top. But something to consider. One person 
team for Sage does not work. She's not interested  

481
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:39,680
in it. She's good. And as I said before, it is 
because she understands the weight that carries.  

482
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,120
So, she's just simply not interested in being on 
a one person team ever again. And that's a red  

483
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,319
flag for her because she feels that would mean 
over work. That immediately equals over work.
 

484
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,960
Leadership incompatibility. 
Like I mentioned before,  

485
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,000
she has a current strained relationship 
with her boss. So, she would definitely  

486
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,200
not want to move into a new situation where 
there's another strained relationship. So,  

487
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,600
that's definitely something that's going to be 
that if she's interviewing her potential boss  

488
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:17,440
and there's friction or anything weird going on 
there. And lastly, vague answers. Vague answers,  

489
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:24,480
to me, Stephanie, vague answers always signify 
some sort of coverup, or something is going on.  

490
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:32,000
Or they can't speak freely which is also a danger, 
danger! Moment. So, with all the that being said,  

491
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,360
vague answers for Sage, she agrees, is definitely 
a red flag and something to pay attention to.
 

492
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,879
So, an important thing to do is to shift your 
mindset right before the interview as well.  

493
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,920
These are some of the things that you should be 
thinking. Whether you believe them fully or not,  

494
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,040
they should be the energy with which you carry 
when you're going into an interview. It just helps  

495
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,960
you really hit some things topic wise that you 
might not have hit before. It helps you address  

496
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,720
things more confidently. You think of    you 
think more clearly. Not sure if anyone knows, but  

497
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,160
anxiety is actually the worst for our thinking. 
We make the worst decisions when we are wired.  

498
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,480
And that is because our bodies are in fight 
or flight mode, which means I just want to  

499
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,600
survive. I'm not really thinking about the 
consequences or repercussions of my actions.  

500
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:29,520
I'm just trying to get past this moment.
So, when it comes to your mindset shift.  

501
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,880
You should be thinking of yourself as an asset. 
You would not want to think of yourself as trash.  

502
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:42,800
So, the opposite of that is an asset. I am someone 
who is valuable to someone else. Someone has  

503
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,720
paid me already to do this thing. And someone 
will probably pay me again to do this thing.  

504
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,000
Even if your confidence is a little shot on that 
because of whatever feeling that you might have,  

505
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,600
believing this or chanting this to yourself. So, 
so helpful for getting through the moment. You  

506
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,520
don't need to be confident forever. You 
just need to be confident enough for an  

507
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,840
hour or two or three while you do your 
interview and then you can shed the facade.
 

508
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,480
So, here's where fake it till you make it 
definitely shines through. Like I said, someone's  

509
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,600
paid you to do this job before. If this is your 
second time. If this is your first time, you know,  

510
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,920
someone pays you to do a job period before. Which 
is something that you should think about. Doing  

511
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,640
these steps, taking these measures definitely 
help you be more powerful and step into that power  

512
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,240
more. Because you're coming into it proactively 
instead of reactively. So, remembering that you  

513
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,520
have the power in your career, and you have the 
power to accept or deny anything that doesn't  

514
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,040
fit what you'd like is definitely something 
you should think about before the interview.
 

515
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,160
You want to make sure that you and the company 
are getting what you're paying for. So,  

516
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,360
another thing to think about when it comes to 
the interview is just the logical mindset of  

517
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,280
this should be a mutually beneficial situation. 
I should be the worker that you need. And you  

518
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,640
should be the employer that I need. Especially 
if I have the luxury of being able to decide.
 

519
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,799
So, when it comes to that mindset 
shift, I think it's very powerful  

520
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,800
and important to understand that this is a 
transaction. Because it is. Until you get  

521
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,440
the warm and fuzzies from working there for an 
extended period of time. It is a transaction.  

522
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Are you the employer that I can 
stay with, build with, grow with?  

523
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,759
Or not? And they want to see the same thing out of 
you. So, understanding that there is a two side to  

524
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,480
that conversation is very important when it comes 
to shifting your mindset before the interview.
 

525
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,280
So, during the interview. Remember. 
It's a conversation. And a conversation  

526
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,200
happens between two people. It's not 
a monologue. It's not a performance.
 

527
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,000
you're not there to watch and listen and that's it 
and you clap and go home. You are actually there  

528
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,320
to participate in the discussion when it comes 
to your future and their future. So, remembering  

529
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,840
that it's just a conversation help mess so much 
with easing my nerves because it's like, I had a  

530
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,560
million conversations. I have conversations with 
a whole bunch of people. I've had a podcast, so,  

531
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:14,799
I definitely have had conversation there is too. 
So, remembering that helps with me nerves a lot.  

532
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,960
Interjecting politely when you need 
to is definitely very important.  

533
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:26,240
Especially considering that it is your time too.
And if you feel that it is a    maybe if you're  

534
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:32,160
nervous about interjecting or interrupting, 
something you can ask ahead of time is, if I have  

535
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,600
questions during the discussion, how would you 
like me to handle them? Would you like me to wait  

536
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,480
until you're done or is it okay if you interject 
at any moment? Sometimes they'll do the work for  

537
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,720
you. You can interrupt me, I'm going to blather 
along. That's definitely happened in a couple  

538
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:52,080
interviews. But you can set the tone of saying, 
hey, I have a tendency of wanting to interject. Is  

539
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,480
that okay? Would you want me to do that another 
way? Definitely something you could consider.  

540
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,799
Listen for the red flags that we have discussed 
before. Definitely pay attention and take notes.
 

541
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,800
I've actually been able to mentally take notes 
somehow and remember what the red flags were.  

542
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,720
Maybe because they're glaringly obvious to me when 
I do hear them because of the clarity I have and  

543
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,120
what I want. I don't need to write them down. 
But if you need to, take the time to do so. If  

544
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:29,920
you feel uncomfortable about that, you can maybe 
ask if it's okay if you write notes during it. Or  

545
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,400
maybe just try to write the notes after. I do know 
someone who would wait until after the interview  

546
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,920
was done and then write the notes. So, definitely 
different ways you can handle making sure that you  

547
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,320
take note of what the red flags are.
Ask follow up questions for clarity.  

548
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,040
Sometimes you might get a vague answer. But it's 
not because the person is being shifty or dodgy.  

549
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:57,120
But the answer is really big, and you may not have 
the context and it's a really big story. Sometimes  

550
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,080
a quick follow up question can help with the 
context. This is why they don't want to dive in  

551
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:09,279
here or don't feel I need the information. Asking 
questions for clarity is definitely something you  

552
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,120
should do during the interview. And don't think 
about or focus on any of your short comings  

553
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,600
at all. In the, don't let it come to mind, don't 
really worry about it. That's not your job.  

554
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:29,439
In the interview process, your job is to think 
about how does this job help move me forward?  

555
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,720
And how does this job help me with my job 
satisfaction? And how does this job take  

556
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,640
me towards my life goals and my career goals? 
And how does this job align with my purpose?  

557
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,560
You are not there to think about what they think 
about you. That's their job. They will do that.  

558
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,960
They will do that job, they have done that job. 
They have no problems doing that job. They do not  

559
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,280
need your permission to do that job.
So, when it comes to the interview process,  

560
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,800
you have to think about what's in it for 
you. And you have to have this mindset. Only  

561
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,680
during the interview process, of course, 
like, you know, during everything else,  

562
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,080
you can be a human being and, you know, let the 
warm and fuzzies in. But when it comes to the  

563
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:15,840
interview process, you really need to be very 
clear about the fact that you are an asset. And  

564
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,120
that is what you're concerned about so that 
you can get through the interview process.
 

565
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,880
So, what happens after the interview? 
Aside from a huge sigh of relief?  

566
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,600
You reflect on the good and the bad. So, I always 
say that at the end of the interview process,  

567
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,000
you should probably ask the interviewer if 
there are any notes that they have for you  

568
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,160
from what they've heard from you. Whether it 
be, do I need more experience? Do you think  

569
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,720
I should speak up more? Do you think I was 
softer spoken? How was your perception of me?  

570
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,040
Definitely questions you should ask if you can 
find    the one I typically ask is are there any  

571
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:59,840
notes or feedback that you have for me that will 
help me whether    whether with how or without.  

572
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:06,080
I'm always looking to learn. And I would like to 
do so if there's an opportunity here to do so.
 

573
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,080
That is all encompassing, I think. And gets people 
thinking about, well, okay, what was my impression  

574
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,880
or experience about you and then giving you the 
feedback of that. That's definitely important.  

575
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,400
Nothing thing you should do is something 
awesome for yourself. Whether that be take  

576
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,120
yourself out to eat, go out with friends, visit 
friends or family, go somewhere with your dog.  

577
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,320
You need to reward yourself for doing that. 
Interviews are so challenging, they're so hard,  

578
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,880
so daunting. And it takes so much to do them and 
to get to that point that in order to just have  

579
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,280
a good dopamine hit, it's great to do something 
awesome for yourself. Even if it's just as simple  

580
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:53,040
as curling up in bed with a book. Take time to do 
that. And refine your wants, needs and goals. You  

581
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,800
may find some information during the interview 
process that highlights more of what you want  

582
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:04,800
in life or highlights something you don't really 
want in life. It definitely depends on how the  

583
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,520
interview goes and what you learn there. Or you 
may find out that things are not as important as  

584
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,720
you thought they were. And you're willing to make 
certain sacrifices depending on what the job is.  

585
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,320
All those things are definitely on the table when 
it comes to refining your wants and needs. And  

586
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:26,560
then clap for yourself! Because you've done it. 
And it's great. And I feel like it's a lot to put  

587
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:33,120
yourself out there. It's a lot to feign confidence 
when we have imposter syndrome. So, if you take  

588
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:38,799
the time to do it, it should be acknowledged. 
If not by anyone but yourself, so be it.
 

589
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,600
So, what's next for Sage? Where does she go from 
here after going through the interview process,  

590
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:51,440
changing her mindset, refining what she wants and 
what she needs from an employer? What happens next  

591
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,360
for her? So, she's more confident in interviews. 
Learning that it's a transaction and that it's  

592
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:03,200
nothing personal at all based on who she    what 
her worth is or who she is helps her to maintain  

593
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,759
confidence when it comes into these spaces. I can 
be ambitious. And I could also acknowledge that I  

594
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,280
would like to very much leave my current role 
without setting myself up or playing myself.  

595
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,640
And how do I do that? By being more proactive when 
it comes to my approach to it rather than reactive  

596
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,960
and put myself in a bad situation. She's 
more confident when it comes to interviews.  

597
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,800
She has a way higher potential for job 
satisfaction, for higher job satisfaction  

598
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,960
because she's taking the time out to find 
out what she wants and needs and who she is.  

599
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:40,160
Therefore, it's super clear who would not align 
with that, and it makes a lot higher potential  

600
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,520
for job satisfaction in the end of that.
Has greater clarity on internal desires. So, this  

601
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,240
process actually is a twofer. It gives you clarity 
own what journey you want to go on, where you want  

602
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,720
to go. A lot of us, or some of us, don't really 
think we have a plan, are not thinking that far  

603
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,759
ahead. We have a baby goal. But sometimes having a 
huge goal helps us refine what a baby goal should  

604
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:09,040
be and what's not on the radar at all. This helps 
even on the personal level of where do I want to  

605
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:16,720
go and how can I align myself to what I want to do 
in the future. Also, she realizes she's the prize.  

606
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:24,720
Which is a huge deal. I feel like realizing you're 
the prize is the great new relationship when it  

607
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,919
comes to looking for jobs. I think that jobs and 
employers will understand that you value yourself.  

608
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,040
You will understand that you value yourself. And 
they will value you much more because of it.
 

609
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:44,800
So, definitely a great transition for Sage from 
the girl that we knew in the beginning who was  

610
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:51,600
just in a really tough situation and didn't know 
the way out. So, we are done with Sage for now.
 

611
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:58,240
Now we're moving on to resources. So, when 
it comes to this job searching process,  

612
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:04,240
there is definitely some resources that I have 
not mentioned that take a little bit more time  

613
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:12,319
to either build or do. But I still think they're 
important to note in case you need some assistance  

614
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:18,560
when it comes to this process. I'm going to us 
is networking and a book that definitely has  

615
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:28,799
helped me in the ways in which I network next
So, for me. I am an introvert. Though it is  

616
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:35,520
probably not clear because I am sitting in 
front of you keynoting an event. But I am  

617
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:41,360
an introvert and I do not enjoy networking. 
I think that it is a personal hell for me.  

618
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,800
Mostly because there's a bunch of small talk 
and I absolutely cringe on the inside when it  

619
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:55,360
comes to small talk. I'm someone that will talk 
with a complete stranger about, I don't know,  

620
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:01,760
trauma. But I will not want to talk to them about 
the weather. That will immediately drain me. So,  

621
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:06,960
when it comes to networking events, I most 
certainly don't even meet anyone. I sit in  

622
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,360
some corner, and I say, if somebody talks 
to me, cool. If not, then I am completely  

623
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:17,840
fine sitting here. So, as someone who has had an 
ambitious mindset, I definitely had to figure out,  

624
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:24,000
what was the best way for Stephanie to network 
in a way that just went more with my personality?  

625
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,960
And that was the following: Volunteering. 
So, volunteering for stuff. Whether that be  

626
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:37,520
in the past I volunteered for WISP, which 
is women in security and privacy. And they  

627
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,840
provide scholarships for women and non binary 
folks to attend different conferences, be part  

628
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,640
of different trainings and things like that.
And so, I was volunteering with them to be a  

629
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:58,000
lead for DEFCON two years in a row. Or one year. 
It was supposed to be two years in a row. But that  

630
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,840
was my way of meeting a whole bunch of people 
who I'm really cool with now who have helped  

631
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:08,160
me in many ways. Who has definitely exposed me to 
a bunch of people, and WISP definitely exposed me  

632
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:17,200
to The Diana Initiative. I won a scholarship when 
I went to DEFCON. In a lot of ways, volunteering  

633
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,319
can get you access to different people who may 
invite you to the conferences, you might get  

634
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:30,240
a free ticket. You can also volunteer at local 
tech related events in your city or around you.
 

635
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,720
But it's kind of a way of meeting people that 
isn't so cringe because you walk up to someone  

636
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,720
at a networking event. They know what it is. 
It's a networking event. It's obvious what  

637
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:46,000
you're doing. It can be kind of awkward. Whereas 
if you're volunteering, you're doing something and  

638
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,400
you're actually participating in something. You're 
part of something. You have more to talk about  

639
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:57,360
that's not just the weather or the sports team of 
the city that you're in. So, speaking    speaking  

640
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,240
is a great networking opportunity. When you 
have fellow speakers, you definitely get to  

641
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,399
talk to them about different things that can 
highlight different opportunities for you.
 

642
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,720
And I think it's just a great avenue for putting 
yourself out there. Also, a lot of people watch  

643
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,480
a lot of different talks, and you never know who 
is watching. You never know what opportunities can  

644
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,600
come from that. I have had a lot of opportunities 
come from speaking engagements, both free and  

645
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:27,040
paid. And I think that speaking is definitely 
an avenue for that. And you also gain some great  

646
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,800
friends and I have some great friends I've met 
just by speaking in tandem with them or in the  

647
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,640
same conference as well. So, definitely something 
that you can do. Local tech meetup groups. When  

648
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:44,960
things are back to normal and it is safe for you 
to do so, local tech meetup groups are how I met a  

649
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:51,760
lot of people locally which definitely helps when 
it comes to, you know, knowing somebody who knows  

650
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:58,400
the landscape in your city. People can give you 
advice from outside of your city. But it sometimes  

651
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,200
does not work, depending on what the landscape is 
and what the environment is in your city in terms  

652
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:10,480
of industry. So, for instance, Houston's very oil 
and gas centered. You may go somewhere else. San  

653
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,800
Jose is more techie or startup centered. So, you 
would probably have different advice depending on  

654
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,920
who you talk to and where they live. So, knowing 
the people locally, definitely invaluable.
 

655
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:30,080
Security related organizations. That's definitely 
something that you can do to meet people and isn't  

656
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:36,000
as awkward as like a networking event. And 
social media. Social media is a huge one.  

657
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,360
For anyone who is super shy or super reserved 
or does    don't like to meet people in person,  

658
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:47,760
social media definitely helps you get over 
that very quickly. At least it did for me.  

659
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,320
I think I was very, very    not shy    but 
just kind of reserved and kind of like to,  

660
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,400
you know, play the    play the background. 
And then being on social media,  

661
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,440
having a voice and a lot of people appreciating 
it definitely got me out of my shell and I've  

662
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,600
definitely met a lot of people from there. 
And it's the reason why I became a speaker  

663
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,480
in the first place. So, definitely a 
great avenue for networking as well.
 

664
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:22,080
And this lovely book here. Now, I won't spoil the 
book for you. But I want to rave about it. So, I  

665
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:28,880
mentioned Keirsten Brager in the beginning of this 
talk as one of my mentors and one who has helped  

666
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:37,040
me so much with my journey. Meeting Keirsten was 
definitely one of the turning points of my career  

667
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:42,560
and I met her at a time where I was pretty much 
lost. And a lot of what I came to talk to you  

668
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:49,200
about today was inspired by what she told me when 
I first met her and what she said ever since then.  

669
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,720
And a lot of what she said is in this book that 
she's written for women on how to get a six figure  

670
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:02,640
career. That's something that you want. It talks 
about negotiation. She has perspectives from white  

671
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,960
males in the industry, which is very important. 
And how they negotiate. And being the higher  

672
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:15,120
earners, or historically being the higher earners. 
It's definitely interesting to see the energy with  

673
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:21,680
which they carry when they go into negotiations.
And the confidence with which they ask for what  

674
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,399
they're asking for. And what they're asking for. 
I feel like a lot of it is super eye opening  

675
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,600
depending on what you have been exposed to 
previously. So, it's pretty much the best hand  

676
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:36,240
guide for someone who doesn't have the networking 
that I talked about in the previous slide.  

677
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:41,840
So, networking takes time. Getting to know people 
takes time. Building relationships takes time.  

678
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:49,360
This book, however, is available on Amazon. 
And you can simply go purchase it, read it,  

679
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,720
and it will tell you some other steps that you 
can take. Talks about smart goals, CISSP prep.  

680
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,480
So much information in there. It's definitely 
helped. It's something I refer to every single  

681
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:07,040
time I give advice. Every single time I 
am considering moving positions or jobs.  

682
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,839
It definitely has helped me, and I definitely 
think it is something to check out as well.
 

683
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:24,479
So, when it comes to key takeaways. The first 
thing is you are your greatest asset. As much  

684
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:30,160
as you might have people around that you probably 
love or that definitely are assets in your life,  

685
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:37,840
they are not you. And they will not live as long 
as you live or won't be as directly as impactful.  

686
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,760
And what I mean by that is that you will live 
with you, guaranteed, for the rest of your life.  

687
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,840
However, you may not live with the other people 
around you. So, understanding that you are your  

688
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,560
greatest asset is definitely important when 
it comes to hiring the right boss. But just  

689
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,720
moving in the right direction in general.
You have to treat yourself accordingly.  

690
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:07,520
Which means drop the pick me attitude, drop the 
pick me mindset, drop the survival mindset and  

691
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:14,160
don't let the ambitious mindset be detrimental to 
you. And recognize that your greatest asset and  

692
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,200
even if you get rejected, it has no bearing on who 
you are and what you have to bring to the table.  

693
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:25,920
You just have to find the right fit. Number two.
Where you work and the life you have while working  

694
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:34,160
there matters. It's all fun and games until 
you're working 60 hours a week. And make sure  

695
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,399
that you don't end up in situation where that's 
your reality. Knowing that you might have other  

696
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,479
things you might want to do in this life. And 
knowing you have other things you might want to  

697
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:48,319
pour into. Whether that's a family, whether that 
be friends, whether that be traveling. Whatever  

698
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:56,400
makes your soul happy. Making sure that where you 
work doesn't directly impact or negatively impact,  

699
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:02,240
rather, that journey or that goal is definitely 
something important. And last but not least,  

700
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:07,120
knowing you're the prize kills imposter 
syndrome and helps with career happiness.
 

701
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,760
I don't think that there will be a single person 
that says, hey. After watching your talk, I  

702
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:20,480
felt like I was a prize. And then everything went 
horribly wrong after that fact. Me having more  

703
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:27,120
confidence and resulted in my complete and total 
demise. That does not pretty much    that's not  

704
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:33,040
likely to happen. What is likely to happen is you 
step in your confidence, and you own yourself and  

705
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,320
you own where you're at in your skill set. 
And you get further ahead without having  

706
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:44,160
the annoying imposter syndrome in your ear saying 
you can't succeed, you're a fraud, they're going  

707
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:50,960
to find out about you. Something everybody feels. 
Knowing you're a prize definitely helps with  

708
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,680
hurting that imposter syndrome. Not eradicating 
it, it's very hard to get rid of, but at least  

709
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:03,040
affecting it to where you can move in power and 
then help you with career happiness overall.
 

710
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:09,200
Last but not least, I wanted to take the time 
to discuss this because it's very important.  

711
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:17,839
Fire your boss if you need to. That's a 
very important thing to say. As my boss  

712
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:24,080
actually watch this is presentation. It's very 
important because I feel like for me and for a  

713
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:29,920
lot of people I've talked to over my years in 
this industry, a lot of people have struggled  

714
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:36,000
with a strained or harmful relationship with 
their boss. There's even a saying that says,  

715
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:44,640
people don't quit bad jobs, they quit bad bosses. 
And as is such, making sure that relationship is  

716
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,400
good. Knowing that this person is pretty 
much the    the gatekeeper, you know?  

717
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:58,160
The Heimdall, if you will. If you know that 
Marvel reference. The Heimdall to your career  

718
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:05,200
and the only one take open up the way, the 
past forward. It's really important to have a  

719
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,800
super solid relationship with that person. And if 
you're not able to do that, for whatever reason.  

720
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,880
Whether you've tried managing up. Whether you've 
tried different tactics and sought out advice  

721
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,720
and it's just not working, do not hesitate to 
fire your boss. It's time to let that job go  

722
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:29,360
and go somewhere that you're appreciated, where 
you can thrive. Where you can experience happiness  

723
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,920
and not have to worry about the burnout that does 
come from a strained relationship with your boss.  

724
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,520
So, with that being said, thanks 
for coming to my TDI talk.
 

725
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:46,240
You can find me at the following. My email is 
listed here. I'm always on Twitter. Though,  

726
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:52,240
less so in the last couple days while I prepared 
for this. My website, you can find the links to my  

727
01:12:52,240 --> 01:13:00,480
Twitter there or my LinkedIn there. And you can 
definitely find me anywhere @stephandSec. So,  

728
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,440
I hope that you enjoyed this talk. I will be 
available for questions if you've not already  

729
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,799
asked, and I haven't already answered. 
I'm really excited to get talking to you  

730
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,400
about what we've discussed 
today. So, thank you so much  

731
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,839
and I appreciate everyone.
PHOENIX:  

732
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,280
Hi again. That was a fantastic talk!
STEPHANIE: Thank you.
 

733
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:36,240
PHOENIX: It looks like the feedback has been 
fantastic. I haven't captured any questions yet.
 

734
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:43,760
STEPHANIE: I actually have a few. So, I waited 
until the end to address them. I found some.  

735
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:51,679
So, one of them was do you have tips for video 
interviews because it can be harder to read  

736
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:58,400
non verbals over video? And I won't lie. I 
think the last interview process I had for  

737
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:03,440
my current job I had a total of ten interviews. 
Some of them were virtual, some of them were not.  

738
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:10,160
Because I completely onboarded remotely. So, 
facial expressions still give a lot away.  

739
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:15,680
You can't see the tensing, depending on the 
angle of the camera. But facial expressions.  

740
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:22,880
Also, word choice is very important. And tone. 
So, try to listen more for the other cues that  

741
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,720
are not as obvious. Or something that you 
might take for grant when had you're seeing  

742
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,480
someone. You can take in the full picture. But 
I think picking up on tone. How much a person  

743
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:37,919
gives in terms of information. Those things are 
very important and kind of contribute to that. So,  

744
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,000
I definitely understand the challenge    
challenge there. So, don't beat yourself up if you  

745
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,960
miss something. But there's still other cues 
that you could kind of take note of when it  

746
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:53,360
comes to that. So, I hope that was helpful.
PHOENIX: Awesome. One question I saw was:  

747
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,160
How do you deal with retaliation 
when you decide to leave a job?
 

748
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:03,120
STEPHANIE: Yeah. So, the thing about retaliation 
is that person typically doesn't have    now,  

749
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:08,320
granted, there are people that have reach outside 
of the company    but for a lot of these folks,  

750
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:14,719
their power and authority kind of live and 
die in the company that you work for. So,  

751
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:18,560
there are a lot of things that can happen. When 
it comes to retaliation, there's so many different  

752
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,320
actions that can be taken. So, I'm struggling a 
little bit with this answer. But I think one of  

753
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:30,080
the most important things to remember is 
that you can leave at any point in time.  

754
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:37,280
A lot of people will point you towards HR. I'm 
not going to lie to you. I have not had the best  

755
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:42,400
experience with that. Though that is pretty much 
your main option when it comes to the company.  

756
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:50,160
So, I tend to high tail it out of there. I tend to 
leave as soon as possible. And unfortunately enter  

757
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:55,519
into survival mindset. But that's a different 
case. Once your environment becomes abusive,  

758
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:01,520
you really can't do the best for yourself anyway 
under those restraints. That is important.  

759
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,800
Sometimes also having an ally in leadership. 
Especially like a different department than  

760
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,720
yours might be helpful as well. I've had the 
opportunity to move to a different team which  

761
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,640
helped with any retaliation that I received.
But honestly speak, if that's able to go on and  

762
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,480
you have been able to consult the channels 
available to you and nothing is happening,  

763
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:28,160
it's really a dicey situation. 
I advise leave if possible.  

764
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:36,799
I know that was a very dramatic ending, but yeah.
PHOENIX: No, no, no. That's great. Would you  

765
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,920
consider it a red flag if the interviewer 
doesn't give you any time to ask questions?
 

766
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:48,720
STEPHANIE: Yeah. I actually would consider it a 
red flag. Especially considering those interviews  

767
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:54,960
are not short. They tend to be like an hour, at 
least. Or 30 minutes. If they are not interested  

768
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,120
in what you have to say at all or they didn't 
anticipate that you would have something to say,  

769
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:05,280
I feel like that is indicative of what your 
experience will be on staff. You will also  

770
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,800
be muted on staff. And you will probably not 
be listened to. So, definitely a red flag.  

771
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,840
Something that I would definitely consider.
PHOENIX: How much do you talk about your  

772
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,880
side gigs? Like podcasts or blogs during an  

773
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,480
interview? Are they a plus or a distraction?
STEPHANIE: So, funny enough, the job I have  

774
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:32,559
currently is the first time I ever mentioned any 
of my side stuff. Period. I was very nervous about  

775
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:39,680
that because in the past I have not had support 
when it came to having a life outside of work. So,  

776
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,560
I mentioned it because I felt like it was only 
gonna get worse. And so, I needed the employer  

777
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,440
to know that I am active outside of    outside 
of the job. But in the community. I also feel  

778
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,440
like it's important for the employer to know that 
you have network    a network. You have contacts,  

779
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:00,160
you have things that you're doing. Cause it 
helps them understand that you're of value  

780
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,080
because you have other options. You 
have other things to explore. So,  

781
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:11,280
I do mention it now. I won't lie to you, though, 
I waited until I built up a good network and have  

782
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:17,360
more confidence in my skill set before doing 
so. So, protect yourself first always. But it's  

783
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,240
definitely something that I talk about because 
it's going to come up. I'm gonna need time off  

784
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:28,080
or support. My current role would actually 
reimburse or help me with travel when it  

785
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,720
comes to that. Definitely relief when it comes 
to the events that are not necessarily paid.
 

786
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,360
So, I think it's important to mention and 
also hear the response. Even if, you know,  

787
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,519
you keep it on the hush when you're there. Just 
knowing how they feel about that is definitely  

788
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,520
a good indication during the interview process.
PHOENIX:  

789
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,000
How do you handle conflict between different 
teams that negatively affect the information  

790
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,280
security initiatives?
STEPHANIE:  

791
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,760
This is difficult. Because as the security 
   depending on how things are sorted in your  

792
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,040
environment, as a security person, you're 
often seen as the no guy or the no girl.  

793
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,960
And so, there could be conflict that arises 
because of perspective shifts and responsibility  

794
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:21,630
shifts. I tend to work closely with leadership. I 
also tend to like to meet with people one on one  

795
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:29,280
virtually if possible. And kind of cultivate 
a relationship so that they know that none of  

796
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:34,719
this is personal. Most of this is because it's 
my job as a security practitioner to do certain  

797
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,400
things and I honestly would not be talking 
to them about this if that wasn't the case.
 

798
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,400
So, kind of helping to decide, hey, I've got my 
responsibilities. You've got yours. I want to hear  

799
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,799
what your pain points are, and I would love for 
you to hear mine. Is definitely on how you ease  

800
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:55,680
up on the tension on how security can function 
in different IT environments. That's something  

801
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:00,640
I definitely have done. Also, your leadership 
is a good indication of that. If they don't have  

802
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:07,440
good relationships with the other teams, you will 
struggle because that definitely tracks downward.  

803
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:13,120
So, that's something that you need to take into 
consideration as well. If your boss is not able to  

804
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,880
manage relationships with other teams, it's going 
to be challenging. Not impossible. But challenging  

805
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,600
for you as well. So, nothing is think about.
PHOENIX:  

806
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,840
I haven't seen other questions come 
up. But kind of as a follow up to that,  

807
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,960
in your interview process while 
you're, you know, deciding  

808
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,160
who is the right fit for you, how do 
you get a feel for that? Those kind  

809
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:49,120
of dynamics and politics in the interview?
STEPHANIE: So, as I stated before, I'm a huge  

810
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:57,280
psychology nerd. So, 95% of our brain activity 
is subconscious. So, when you think about it that  

811
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:03,519
way, a lot of times you understand a situation 
before you consciously process what's going on.  

812
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,160
So, what I'm effectively saying is, trust 
your gut. I think once you're listening to  

813
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,000
things and paying attention, your brain 
is working in the background and running  

814
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,800
processes that kind of inform your decision. So, 
if your gut is like this is a no, no, no! Run!  

815
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,160
I think you should listen to this. The reason 
why will probably come up later if you spend  

816
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:27,599
enough time reflecting. But I think going with 
your gut is definitely important. Especially if  

817
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,800
you're in any of the mindsets I talked about. If 
you're in survival mindset, you're gut actually  

818
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,840
is helpful. It's just that your perspective is 
off because you're concerned about escaping.
 

819
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,000
So, making sure you think about all 
the things you're escaping from or  

820
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,080
you're running from in those situations and paying 
attention to hearing any similarities between the  

821
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,760
environment you're leaving and the environment 
you're going to. Definitely important.
 

822
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,280
But I think writing a list down of the questions 
that you need beforehand, your non negotiables,  

823
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:03,040
getting clear on that helps with those situations 
because sometimes in the moment you don't  

824
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:09,120
have the ability to finesse a situation 
or even come up with the right questions.  

825
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,160
So, making sure you write them down, prep a 
little bit beforehand and kind of get an idea  

826
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,240
of what kind of questions you're gonna ask and 
what's a non negotiable. Very, very important.
 

827
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:27,360
PHOENIX: Okay. Thank you. It looks like we're in 
the last couple of questions as far as time. One  

828
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:34,320
question that was left was: Do you believe that 
it's visible to interview for an internship  

829
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,719
or accept that with the intention of 
moving to a different department?
 

830
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:45,120
STEPHANIE: This is tricky. This is tricky 
for a lot of reasons. Because I think  

831
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,519
employers have historically    or at least in 
my experience    they've historically counted  

832
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:58,480
that as a bad thing. However, I think that it's 
a great thing depending on what your options are.  

833
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:05,120
But I also think that you should probably try to 
go for the internship that's directly tied to what  

834
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,559
you want to do. It's just an easier move. I think 
I've definitely accepted jobs before thinking I  

835
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,040
would be able to move into a different department, 
especially when I was trying to get into security.  

836
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,760
And that was painful. It was very painful process. 
You might be dealing with politics you don't  

837
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:28,160
understand. We just talked about a question where 
certain teams have friction between them. So,  

838
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:33,280
you don't know what you're walking into when you 
do that. And you're not sure how    it basically  

839
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:40,880
creates uncertainty on your end. I think some 
employers also consider that not great because  

840
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,080
they want to hire you for the position that they 
want. But we're not worried about them today.
 

841
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:51,840
But in terms of your own path, I think it would 
create some trickiness when it comes to moving if  

842
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:58,960
that's not as easy as you would anticipate. So, I 
would probably go for the internship directly tied  

843
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:03,520
to what I want to do rather than the internship 
that's in a different department but gets me in  

844
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,960
the company door. It just doesn't always work. 
But if you've asked during your interview if  

845
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,680
that's something that happens and if it's easiest 
   like if it's simple or easy like in my current  

846
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:19,520
role. They definitely talk about moving teams 
all the time. You can definitely do that. I feel  

847
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,680
there would be no issues there and you can create 
relationships before being able to move. I think  

848
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:29,520
it's actually a great idea. And sometimes working 
a didn't role in the company helps you inform your  

849
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,160
decision when is you get into the new role. So, 
I definitely think that that's important. But  

850
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:38,000
I would ask certain questions before doing 
that. Because that's definitely a gamble.
 

851
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,160
PHOENIX: Perfect. Thank you for your time. If 
there are any    we still have a ton of questions,  

852
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:51,680
but we're unfortunately out of time. Are there any 
closing remarks or last items you would like for  

853
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:58,800
people to take with them before we close out?
STEPHANIE: Mostly that being in a position of  

854
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:06,640
power, even if you don't feel like you necessary 
have power, it actually works. It helps. It kind  

855
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:12,720
of emits this energy around you where people 
just kind of sense that you value yourself.  

856
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:17,280
So, sometimes spending the time doing cheesy 
stuff like writing affirmations or a pep talk  

857
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:22,800
in the mirror. Those things seem like cheesy 
and ineffective, but honestly, they help so much  

858
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,640
for that energy that you're trying to 
cultivate and trying to exude when you're  

859
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:32,480
in these interview processes. So, I just hope that 
this was very helpful to everyone, and I hope that  

860
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,360
moving forward when it comes to interviews that 
you will try your best to get into a position of  

861
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:48,160
power before engaging in those processes.
PHOENIX: Great. Thank you!
