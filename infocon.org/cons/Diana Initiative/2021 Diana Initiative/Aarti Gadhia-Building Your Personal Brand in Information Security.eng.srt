building your personal brand

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
in information security over the next

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,520
40 minutes after i introduce myself

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
further

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,758
i'll share the challenges individuals

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,399
face

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,120
when building your brand there will be

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
some audience participation i

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
love audience participation so

your participation today

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,239
i'll then leverage the concept of the

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,520
golden circle

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
which is why how and what

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,080
if you're not familiar with this concept

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,959
there's a great

62
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,760
ted talk as simon sinek explains it well

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,800
this is all about starting with why why

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
building your brand is important

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,120
i'll then share examples of cyber

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,959
security professionals

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,840
and how they've been building their

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,200
brand and then i'll end it with

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,079
what you can do through five simple tips

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
okay so a little bit about me and about

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,440
my safari

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,040
being kenyan i have to bring the word

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,319
safari into my talks

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
does the slide uh move forward did it do

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,080
you progress

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
so yeah perfect there we go there was a

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,159
bit of a lag

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
so a bit about my safari as i mentioned

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,480
i'm going to relate it to how it is as i

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
built my brand

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,959
my purpose as a change agent is to be a

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,920
voice

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,879
as i've dedicated my entire career to

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,159
break down barriers

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,080
and boundaries for underrepresented

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
groups in stem

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
and in leadership i'm passionate about

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,040
changing

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
the status quo to close the gender

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
diversity gap

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
how i have done this is to stand out to

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,480
lead

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
and she that you heard as kat introduced

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,840
me earlier on

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
she which stands for sharing her

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
empowerment the impact has been

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,799
30 women in cyber security have already

98
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,360
begun

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
the board journey of the last year as a

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,599
result

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
and we've also seen a 50 increase within

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
the organization that i work at

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,760
in hiring individuals identified as

104
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
women

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
when i was honored for my contribution

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
in the cyber security industry by being

107
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,479
named

108
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,479
as one of the top 20 women in cyber

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
security in canada

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
it helped me become a stronger voice

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
and it inspired me to share my journey

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
in the book the rise of the cyber women

113
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
volume 2.

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,880
i currently work for backround and

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
recently was appointed as the board

116

117
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
during my free time i volunteer on cyber

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
security boards such as isaka she leads

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,680

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
i enjoy cooking you'll see my posts

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
about cooking

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
and as you can see in the picture here i

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,479
enjoy riding motorcycles

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,919
so let's try and understand the

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,800
challenges

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,639
and obstacles why isn't everyone

130
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
building their brand

131
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,680
as i began my research about this topic

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,880
i went to individuals and most most

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
individuals say they know the value

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
but what's stopping them i asked my

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
friends i asked

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,320
family and were colleagues

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
what their challenges or obstacles have

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,800
been when building their brand

139
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
and i received these comments that i'll

140
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
categorize it into

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
six categories not enough time

142
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
i haven't thought about it i'm not sure

143
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,520
of the value

144
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
fear of negative criticism don't know

145
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
how to build one

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,039
and imposter syndrome

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
in the survey you can see i didn't

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
see anyone select the fear of negative

149
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
criticism however

150
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,759
just yesterday i did speak to a founder

151
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
and for him he said it was fear of how

152
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
a negative brand could affect his

153
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,800
business

154
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
which is his obstacle to bring to

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,960
building his

156
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,199
brand he said that was the fear that was

157
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,160
coming in the way

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
for him i could actually understand and

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,960
relate to that statement

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,840
but we had a deeper conversation and i

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,240
shared

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
a little bit about this talk another

163
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
interesting

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
point bringing it back to the fear part

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
is that according to research it takes

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
seven seconds to form

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
first impressions so i read that

168
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,680
research and i thought

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
let me let me try it out and experiment

170
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,520
it i have an eight-year-old niece

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
she's staying with me and

172
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,680
i acted three different personas

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,759
and in literally in seven seconds she

174
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
could tell me

175
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,880
which individual she liked best

176
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
and if you think about it in a job

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
interview if the interviewer doesn't

178
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,080
know you

179
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,680
right the first impression is critical

180
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,039
because of those seven seconds when i

181
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,639
tested it out with my knee straight away

182
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
she formed an opinion on each of those

183
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,360
personas and

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
chose one who she liked the most it was

185
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,639
the same person me

186
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
of course and you may not be aware but

187
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,639
with

188
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
every interaction you have with your

189
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,240
network whether this is through a

190
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
conversation

191
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
or through social media or through your

192
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,120
project work

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
you're building your personal brand and

194
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,720
in the interview phase

195
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
if they knew your brand whether um

196
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,720
they knew about you through social media

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,400
or through somebody whatever the case

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,160
may be

199
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,000
that could influence how your interview

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
goes that could influence that seven

201
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,440
second

202
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,720
opinion so this is another reason on how

203
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
fear where i can relate to and

204
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,840
understand how fear

205
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,520
can be an obstacle and again as you'll

206
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,039
see from the survey results in the in

207
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
the pie chart here

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
the top two are not enough time and

209
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
impostor syndrome

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
i've heard a lot about imposter syndrome

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
different speakers talked

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,080
during this conference and in how to

213
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
handle it right and if you see here

214
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:25,759
that's about

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,319
between the two time and impostor

216
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:28,960
syndrome

217
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,279
that's about 75 in those two categories

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,320
the biggest tip that i'd like to share

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,839
to you all is to recognize your obstacle

220
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,799
and to overcome it

221
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,720
i hear the time constraint as a

222
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
challenge

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
from so many individuals hey i'll raise

224
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,800
my hand

225
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,080
i had this excuse a lot and i used it a

226
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
lot of times

227
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
until i missed out an opportunity

228
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,279
and that's when it got me to reflect

229
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
i'd like to highlight the importance of

230
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
investing in yourself

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,080
and i'll cover more details in the talk

232
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,519
as one of the negative

233
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
consequences in not investing time in in

234
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
yourself or in building your brand

235
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,719
could be a missed opportunity

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,600
in my journey other things would always

237
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
come in the way

238
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
i started journaling and through that i

239
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,720
realized

240
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
how much time i spent on things that

241
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,640
were not important

242
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
that's when i was like okay i can remove

243
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
all these other different things

244
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
and i can find time to invest in myself

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,279
now i know getting started is probably

246
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,240
the hardest

247
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
part which is why i'm going to help you

248
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,399
all

249
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,519
i've created a virtual exercise

250
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,920
that will go through and would love your

251
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,800
participation

252
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,160
i don't know about you but i love swag

253
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,959
so i have an incentive so that you can

254
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,640
participate

255
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
if you participate and submit it by the

256
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
end of this talk

257
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
i will have a random draw and will send

258
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:13,920
a

259
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
signed copy of the book and a t-shirt so

260
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
t-shirt and a signed copy of the book

261
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,720
by taking the time to participate

262
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
my hope is to inspire you

263
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,959
and i promise you that once you start it

264
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,279
will

265
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
spark your journey i've included the

266
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,600
link

267
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,720
to a google form in the chat

268
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,640
which i will make sure i can do right

269
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
now

270
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
hopefully you can see it and so that you

271
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
can complete it so

272
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,839
in you can see it in the slide you can

273
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,600
see it on the chat hopefully you can all

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,959
see it

275
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,640
and it of course i'm going to ask the

276
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,519
moderator to repost it if you if it

277
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
isn't coming through

278
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
and i'd like you to open it and fill it

279
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
as we go along

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,920
right so i'll go through these four

281
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
questions

282
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
okay hopefully you should be able to see

283
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,040
the forum yes i can see it in the chat

284
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
okay so let's go through these four

285
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,480
questions and i'm going to help you

286
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
along the way

287
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,480
on this you're investing the next 40

288
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
minutes with me

289
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,519
that time constraint is no longer a

290
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,959
barrier

291
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,000
so the first question is to write down

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
your why

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
think of it as your purpose it's okay if

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
you haven't thought about your purpose

295
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,079
yet

296
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
for me my safari of experiences led me

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
to understand my purpose

298
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
as i didn't want anyone else to

299
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
experience the same roadblocks

300
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,440
so my purpose was to be to become a

301
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,959
voice or to be a voice

302
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,560
became clearer over the years

303
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
connect your purpose to how it will

304
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
better the world

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
for example my purpose is connected to

306
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,760
diversity

307
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
equity inclusive and making this a

308
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,639
better environment making this a better

309
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
industry

310
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
so start thinking about it i'll give you

311
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
examples that will help you

312
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,760
and remember this is about you and your

313
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
purpose

314
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
your why right the second one

315
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,480
as you can see is i'd like you to write

316
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,200
what you're

317
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,560
passionate about then think about how

318
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
you can achieve your purpose using your

319
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
passion

320
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
as you start writing you may notice

321
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,079
things that you didn't think about

322
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,839
i know when i did this exercise on

323
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,880
myself it got me thinking

324
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
and then third as you can see the third

325
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,880
question in the google form

326
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,760
is to write three adjectives that

327
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
describe you

328
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
for example just three that come top of

329
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
mind for example tenacious

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,160
ambitious whatever that you feel that

331
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,959
describes you

332
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,240
focused determined open-minded creative

333
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,160
inspiring reliable leader

334
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
think of all think of three just add

335
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,959
three the first three that come to mind

336
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
these are all examples i went for a

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
leadership course a few years ago

338
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,680
and that exercise for me

339
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,959
to write was all of us as the attendees

340
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,680
was to write the three adjectives and

341
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,800
then to reach out to

342
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,639
10 people in your in my network

343
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
to ask them to write three adjectives

344
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,639
that describe me

345
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,519
and when i did that exercise it

346
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,320
surprised me

347
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
i was so surprised at how i had reached

348
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
out to my family

349
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,639
my work colleagues and friends and it

350
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
came back with all similar adjectives

351
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,360
that described

352
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,680
me i thought it would be different but

353
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,199
they were actually quite similar

354
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,760
between the the different groups i reach

355
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
out to

356
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
and many of us who struggle with

357
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
imposter syndrome this exercise may help

358
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,839
you see

359
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
what you don't see in yourself

360
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,360
and then the last part of the exercise

361
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,720
is to think about

362
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
what you'd like to be known for and

363
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,719
connect it back to your purpose

364
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
right so just start thinking about it

365
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
and like i said i'm going to help you

366
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,199
and inspire you with

367
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,680
examples from other

368
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
industry you know other people or

369
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,120
individuals within the industry

370
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,040
so first let's go with the first example

371
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,399
the first one that's happening today in

372
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,600
this pandemic

373
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,440
the two scientists that you see in the

374
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
picture here

375
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,920
scientists sahin and turesi they're

376
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
known for the brains behind the world's

377
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,639
first

378
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,079
effective coronavirus vaccine pfizer was

379
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,279
the one that reached out and

380
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,519
and worked together with these two

381
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,399
scientists

382
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,880
and their organization that is their

383
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,760
brand

384
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
you know that's what people can relate

385
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
to them as you know when they think

386
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
about the pfizer vaccine

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
if you read this story

388
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
you'll understand that they were not

389
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,160
focused on how to be famous

390
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,279
or how to make money they wanted to

391
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,920
provide

392
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
something for society and that was their

393
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,760
purpose

394
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,040
and for many years they shared a passion

395
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
for cancer research so hopefully this

396
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
as you can see what their purpose was

397
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,199
what their passion was

398
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
right you saw the impact which we'll

399
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,480
talk a little bit more about

400
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
right the second example let's look at

401
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
this example

402
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,079
everyone knows who they are the

403
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,920
anonymous group

404
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
i read an article that shared that the

405
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
media is at a loss

406
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
at how to describe them

407
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,759
one thing for sure that is clear is that

408
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,800
their purpose

409
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,839
is promoting freedom of speech in a way

410
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
that they won't be able to do it

411
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
anonymously

412
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,199
they are a leaderless group and how they

413
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,160
go about their

414
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,320
message is anonymously in a coordinated

415
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
matter manner when you see that mask

416
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,160
immediately you know who they are and

417
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
that's their that's what people

418
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,199
can relate to their brand

419
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,680
so back to the golden circle

420
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
as i talked earlier on let's try to

421
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,079
understand the value and the importance

422
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,639
of

423
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,639
building your brand why should you take

424
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
the time to

425
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
build your brand why is it important and

426
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
what impact does it have

427
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
i loved storytelling growing up i just

428
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
love the storytelling

429
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,320
and i'll explain this through interviews

430
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,920
with women in our industry

431
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
so the first one as you know elisa

432
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
alyssa miller she was the keynote

433
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,720
speaker

434
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
at this conference yesterday great

435
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,640
keynote

436
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
she's currently a baiso business

437
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,959
information security officer for s p

438
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,280
global ratings i reached out to her

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,760
to get her her viewpoints

440
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,959
and as i was interviewing elissa she

441
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,280
shared a story that made her realize the

442
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
importance of

443
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,520
building her brand and impact it had to

444
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
her safari

445
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
a few years ago she applied for a

446
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
leadership position

447
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
she knew she had all the qualifications

448
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
for that leadership position

449
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,120
unfortunately she didn't get that

450
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,400
position

451
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
and the feedback was that she didn't

452
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,960
have management experience

453
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,120
i'm sure many of you can relate to that

454
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
story i know i could

455
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
unfortunately for a long time industry

456
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
leaders believe that some of the reasons

457
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,280
why women

458
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
are not in leadership or board positions

459
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,160
are because we lack ambition

460
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,240
we lack confidence or simply not

461
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,360
qualified

462
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,880
and when you show your hand up sometimes

463
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
you may not get supported you may not be

464
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,400
supported

465
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
sometimes you may even be discouraged

466
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,640
and you may not get what you wanted and

467
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
this is what happened to alyssa

468
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,039
and through this experience she knew she

469
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,320
had to find a way

470
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,879
to turn a no into an opportunity

471
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
alyssa was invited to speak at a

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
conference where she was speaking right

473
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,840
after karen ilizari's talk

474
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
let's jump into the next one uh which

475
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
seat which was speaking right after

476
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,559
karen elazar's talk and i remember

477
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,679
meeting karen

478
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,320
in 2018 at the western canada

479
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
information security conference in

480
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,480
winnipeg

481
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
where she was introduced as the friendly

482
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,240
hacker that was the first time i heard

483
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
someone being introduced as a friendly

484
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,440
hacker

485
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,520
karen is someone elsa always looked up

486
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
to

487
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
and during the interview with alyssa she

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
shared with me

489
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,559
that she saw karen was not afraid of

490
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,080
introducing herself

491
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,679
as a hacker for a long time alyssa

492
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
didn't introduce herself as a hacker

493
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
and i could understand why in fact if we

494
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,039
look back

495
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,960
when you hear the word hacker the first

496
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
thing you know

497
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,120
for many years that used to come to mind

498
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,799
is that they are bad

499
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,360
in fact movies portrayed that as well

500
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,799
where they show someone

501
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
is hacking the system and in the scene

502
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
you see yes i have access

503
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,520
and you get to see you know bad

504
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,360
individuals because they want to steal

505
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,919
and gain

506
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,679
power that's what you see in the movies

507
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,160
right and it's important to share

508
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
that there are two types of hackers

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
ethical

510
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,760
and malicious hackers and the difference

511
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
between the two

512
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,799
is their intention

513
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
karen's talk inspired her audience why

514
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
the world needs hackers

515
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
and to quote from an article where she

516
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,120
shared hackers are hacktivists

517
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,679
oh sorry hackers and hacktivists help

518
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,480
create

519
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
a better world by exposing

520
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,840
vulnerabilities that

521
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,840
push the internet to become stronger and

522
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,960
healthier

523
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
and this inspired alyssa to embrace his

524
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,559
strength as a hacker

525
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,760
alyssa's passion started from a young

526
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
age

527
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

528
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
how she built her brand

529
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
and what she's done so i'll share her

530
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,880
story

531
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
and so as she her passion started from a

532
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,760
young age as she enjoyed exploring and

533
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
deconstructing technology

534
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
to learn more about how it works her

535
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,039
tagline

536
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,880
is do better be better her mission is to

537
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,440
improve

538
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
all aspects of security community and

539
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,120
how she built her brand is through

540
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
speaking engagements

541
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
you saw her yesterday and she speaks at

542
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
so many different

543
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,000
conferences as she focused on her why

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
she began to notice that her brand was

545
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
opening up opportunities for her one

546
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,360
speaking engagement

547
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
led to another and her career also

548
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
progressed

549
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
when you hear alyssa miller or karen and

550
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,799
azaria's name

551
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,440
it's not about what their title is it's

552
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
not about whether they're an

553
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
introvert or an extrovert or it's not

554
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
about what degree or where they studied

555
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,320
or

556
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,840
their location what you see

557
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
is their brand which is built around

558
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
their purpose

559
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,280
and their passion so let's take a deeper

560
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,919
look at the

561
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,039
impact a brand can have for companies

562
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,400
with a strong brand

563
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
it means revenues growth innovation

564
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,000
competition change efficiency innovation

565
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
right

566
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,120
but what is the impact on people

567
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,440
first you're inspiring your audience

568
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
even if one person gets inspired

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
this will help you with your overall

570
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
mission and ultimately making this

571
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,640
a better world could be a world full of

572
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
equal opportunities think about it

573
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,799
karen inspired her audience on why the

574
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
world needs good hackers

575
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
there has been a lot of education and

576
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
awareness in

577
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,240
the recent years and today you can see a

578
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,799
shift

579
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,600
in movies they've evolved they show how

580
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,320
hackers

581
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,640
are leveraged for good purposes right

582
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,080
second it opens up opportunities

583
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,159
for alyssa as she mentioned it opened up

584
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,400
speaking engagements as she's

585
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
been a keynote speaker at many

586
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
conferences

587
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,760
and as you reflect on why your brand is

588
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,799
important

589
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,679
and you begin to build your brand it

590
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,799
will open up opportunities for you

591
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,080
and as you start seeing these

592
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
opportunities remember

593
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,799
your why st you know focus on your

594
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,880
purpose

595
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,799
and as opportunities rise again

596
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,799
don't forget your purpose and keep it

597
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,559
connected to that bigger issue

598
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
or bigger cause

599
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600
at the same time speak up and don't be

600
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,679
afraid of the outcome

601
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
life is like a safari it will be a bumpy

602
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,799
ride

603
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,760
there will be many obstacles for some it

604
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,039
will take five minutes

605
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,720
you know before you see the animals in

606
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
the safari for some

607
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,279
it will take several roads and several

608
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,039
paths before you see it

609
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,840
for some you might find a different end

610
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,679
result

611
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,840
right i don't know where this is going

612
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,279
to take me

613
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,440
but one thing for sure is that i hope to

614
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
inspire you

615
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
to find your purpose and fulfill your

616
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
mission but do it in a way

617
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
where you're not changing your values be

618
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,400
you and be yourself and stay authentic

619
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,360
this will help you be a voice for your

620
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,000
audience

621
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,360
inspire your audience and be the changed

622
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,679
it wasn't easy for alyssa as she faced

623
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,279
many obstacles

624
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,360
it hasn't been easy for me either and

625
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,039
you'll hear several stories

626
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,120
of of the journey we've been through

627
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,840
i know i could have decided to move to

628
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,039
another industry but i didn't

629
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,120
and as you take this opportunity to

630
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,159
build your brand

631
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,840
think about the positive impact it will

632
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,159
have

633
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,440
and lastly to highlight the quote from

634
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,640
jeff bezos your brand is what people say

635
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,360
about you

636
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,679
when you're not in the room none of

637
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,559
these women

638
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,120
are in the room and yet we all agree on

639
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,000
one thing

640
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,919
which is their brand and their

641
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
contribution to this industry

642
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,600
to make it a better place

643
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,080
okay so now we've explained the why

644
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,200
so the next piece i've explained the why

645
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
i've highlighted the impact

646
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,080
next piece is i'll explain how and i'll

647
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,480
share

648
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
an example let's take a look at these

649
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,240
two women

650
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
hillary clinton and michelle obama

651
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,240
both are first ladies served at the

652
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
white house

653
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,080
but both of them have taken different

654
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,120
approaches to building their brand

655
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
how they built their brand is through

656
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
connecting to their audiences

657
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,360
in their own unique way

658
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,240
as part of hillary's campaign i'll give

659
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
you an example

660
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,240
she used her first name just like you

661
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,919
would call a friend

662
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,159
right and that's how she connected to

663
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,039
her audience

664
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,960
she wanted her audience to see her as

665
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,679
that friend

666
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,440
michelle obama she used how she did this

667
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,039
so how she connected and how she was

668
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,640
building her brand and she used social

669
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
media

670
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
to reinvent the role of first lady and

671
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,360
appeal to a young

672
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,480
audience you see her rapping in carpool

673
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
karaoke

674
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,159
she's dancing on the ellen show she's

675
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,120
showing that she's a mom

676
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
now both of them didn't change who they

677
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,240
are

678
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,880
they didn't change their values you

679
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
don't need to have a corporate look

680
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
and you don't need to be the one that

681
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,480
presents on stage to be visible

682
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,840
right you can build your brand to share

683
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,960
several various different channels if

684
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
you're passionate about research

685
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
maybe a blog

686
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,360
maybe write a book if you enjoy public

687
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,400
speaking

688
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,600
cfps like at this conference

689
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,120
if you enjoy video editing social media

690
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
leverage social media at work

691
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,080
it can also be through your project

692
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,360
right like the two scientists or a work

693
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
task

694
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,039
think of it think of ways on how you can

695
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,080
share your passion and

696

697
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
channels

698
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,919
so let me give you examples of three

699
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,440
women in our industry

700
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
who i've been watching over the last 12

701
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,600
months you may or may not know who they

702
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,320
are

703
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,080
but i'll tell you one thing is they've

704
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
been building their brand

705
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,320
and they're making an impact and

706
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,240
bringing a positive change to our

707
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,799
industry

708
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,240
so the first one is

709
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,559
confidence through linkedin actually

710
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,720
that's how i connected confidence and i

711
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
connected with each other

712
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
confidence is the founder of cyber safe

713
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
foundation and she founded

714
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
no go fall maga it was through her work

715
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,480
here

716
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,799
where i saw her purpose to help the most

717
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,320
vulnerable people

718
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,960
and businesses be cyber aware and stay

719
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,039
secure

720
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,600
confidence shared that her passion is to

721
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,720
help people

722
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
securely leverage technology in their

723
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,240
business

724
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,120
in their businesses and personal lives

725
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,600
she's

726
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,159
educating them about cyber hygiene best

727
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,120
practices

728
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
and by training their employees to

729
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,279
increase technical capacity

730
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,559
to defend their organizations

731
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,360
she's educating her audience in a way

732
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,880
that has never been done before

733
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,200
she realized that she was great at

734
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
breaking down cyber security best

735
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,000
practices

736
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,480
and taking complex cyber security

737
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,679
concepts

738
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,559
and communicating in a jargon free and

739
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:44,960
fun

740
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,480
way so she decided to take things a

741
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,840
notch higher

742
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,640
by regularly creating content to teach

743
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,520
these cyber

744
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,320
best practices through a music video

745
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,120
this has had a huge impact on her

746
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,880
personal brand

747
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,440
and created top of mind awareness in the

748
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
minds of her target audiences

749
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
and through this she has had multiple

750
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,600
paid

751
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
speaking engagements it's made

752
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
partnerships easier

753
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
more easier to secure but more

754
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,960
importantly her followers are

755
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
increasingly becoming

756
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,480
more cyber security conscious

757
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,520
it wasn't easy and a major challenge for

758
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
confidence was embracing her personality

759
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,080
differences

760
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,399
you'll see some of her posts on linkedin

761
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,600
she'll refer herself

762
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,520
as nerd and you'll see some of her

763
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,640
videos

764
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
they're phenomenal they're awesome and

765
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,720
during her safari of experiences

766
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,919
she stayed true to herself

767
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,279
it took sitting in as as i share as

768
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,159
you know asked her the question what did

769
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:52,880
you do

770
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,799
and so she said it took sitting in full

771
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,320
awareness

772
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,120
of self and relating her unconventional

773
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
approach to things

774
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,640
and realized this was a positive

775
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,880
differentiator to connect with her

776
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,679
audience

777
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,200
to get the most impact if you google her

778
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,480
video no go fall maga you'll see how the

779
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,039
music video there is educating her

780
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,559
audience about cyber hygiene

781
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,679
when i asked her how she would like to

782
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,320
be

783
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,440
known as when she's not in the room her

784
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
answer was

785
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,279
the woman who used all the tools in her

786
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,240
arsenal

787
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
to help especially the most vulnerable

788
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,760
people

789
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,080
protect themselves from cyber attacks

790
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,159
her tip her advice to building your

791
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,520
brand is to

792
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,799
learn how to speak social media fluently

793
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,520
and think of it as an enabling platform

794
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
to attain your goals share about the

795
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,360
work you're doing

796
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,480
frequently network with like minds and

797
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,720
genuinely seek to add value

798
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,919
to yourself and the world

799
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,640
discover who you are and your cheat

800
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
sheet could be feedback

801
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
and leverage your strengths

802
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
the second individual that i'd like to

803
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,360
highlight

804
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,200
vara varaha i met her a year ago

805
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,559
and i actually met mentor her as well

806
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
pharah studied communication and media

807
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,720
studies

808
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
she wanted to learn coding and maybe

809
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,000
become a software developer

810
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,519
however cyber security and hacking was

811
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,880
really intriguing and she realized that

812
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,399
it is a niche which is extremely

813
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,880
unexplored and therefore that's what led

814
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
her to join the industry

815
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,240
due to her degree in media her passion

816
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,279
was creating valuable content for others

817
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,960
since she came from a non-technical

818
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
background and i know i do a lot of

819
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
talks on there is no cyber security

820
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,640
shortage

821
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,080
there are many individuals i've talked

822
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,360
to that don't have a technical

823
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,320
background

824
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,240
so one of the things for her when she

825
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,679
joined the industry

826
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,159
she found it really difficult initially

827
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,519
to understand

828
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,159
super technical blogs or write-ups about

829
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,279
hacking

830
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,480
as they were full of technical jargon

831
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,880
she knew that she was not the she was

832
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,080
not the only person

833
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,640
facing this problem so she decided to

834
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,760
create a youtube

835
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,159
channel where she would try to simplify

836
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:24,880
the most

837
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,679
technical bugs and make it digestible

838
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,840
for everyone

839
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,559
that itself became her brand and her

840
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,440
purpose

841
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,559
is to help her audience to turn to her

842
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,200
channel

843
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,519
so they don't have to spend hours trying

844
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,640
to understand a complex bug

845
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,840
farah shared that it takes a lot

846
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,880
to push yourself out there i agree

847
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
and be able to entertain or educate

848
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
people

849
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,679
when she began it took her a while to

850
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,159
figure out what direction to take

851
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,559
and had to make some conscious decisions

852
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,480
to give up certain content

853
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,680
ideas which would not fit her vibe

854
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,760
[Music]

855
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,159
through her brand she was offered a

856
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,120
position

857
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,399
as an application security engineer

858
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,159
and i've seen so many individuals who

859
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,000
don't have a technical background or

860
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,080
technical certs and things like that

861
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,200
unable to get a job in this industry and

862
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,240
she shared

863
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,960
that she broke that barrier through her

864
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
brand

865
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,720
it wasn't a concern about not having all

866
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,919
the

867
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,000
certifications and she got this job

868
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,320
offer

869
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,559
pharah's advice is to identify a

870
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,159
struggle or a pain point

871
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,960
that you have faced in the industry you

872
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
may not realize it

873
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,120
but a lot of people are most likely

874
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,159
facing the same

875
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,200
issue i know when i started to stand out

876
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,159
to lead

877
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,080
to get more women on corporate boards

878
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
that's why i did it because i

879
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,799
talked to other women in my network so

880
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,799
try to fill that gap by

881
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,200
bringing and creating value to solve

882
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,039
that problem when i answered the same

883
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:07,919
question

884
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,839
of how she would like her audience to

885
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,679
remember her as

886
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
and she said she would like everyone to

887
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,440
know her as a hacker who tries

888
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,280
to make super technical hacking

889
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
techniques much more

890
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
accessible through her youtube channel

891
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,040
and as you can see she's

892
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,839
got 27 000 subscribers following her

893
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
and they're all she's inspiring her

894
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,839
audience

895
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,839
through her youtube channel

896
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,480
lastly i'm from vancouver so i want to

897
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,520
highlight

898
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,800
local talent here in vancouver canada

899
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,719
i'd like to share selena's safari

900
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,040
like pharah selena also had a

901
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
non-technical background

902
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
she was actually the hr manager at a

903
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
large organization

904
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,160
and she moved from hr to cyber security

905
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,000
where she was part of the sock team

906
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
her advice is to find a mentor or role

907
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,839
models

908
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,839
that you look up to she dedicated time

909
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
with her mentor that helped her build

910
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
her brand internally

911
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
her mentor actually was a sponsor

912
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
because when i first got to know selena

913
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,000
it was actually through her mentor

914
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
and her purpose is to bring in more

915
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,720
diversity into the field by sharing her

916
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,359
story

917
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,359
to kids through volunteering

918
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,760
opportunities with aisaka vancouver she

919
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,440
leads tech

920
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,760
she's passionate about teaching others

921
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,920
to understand the importance of cyber

922
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,200
security and

923
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
what they are potentially exposing

924
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,800
themselves to

925
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,640
from both a work and a personal

926
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,040
perspective

927
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,320
not coming from an i.t background

928
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,640
she always felt as if she were an

929
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
imposter

930
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,800
and was never good enough she thought

931
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,119
that

932
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,000
others would see right through her

933
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,720
gender

934
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,839
also played a role in that people would

935
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,760
tend to question her thoughts

936
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,920
and advice more than her male

937
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,880
counterparts

938
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,800
that's what she was sharing with me as i

939
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,480
chatted with her

940
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,040
over time she's built up knowledge and

941
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,480
confidence to battle these two hurdles

942
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,960
she wants the followers to remember her

943
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
as someone who is genuine

944
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,280
easy to talk to and willing to help

945
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,839
so as you can see there's so many

946
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,839
different ways on how you can build your

947
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,520
brand

948
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,680
and earlier as i shared with you that

949
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,359
google form

950
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,920
with a little exercise right removing

951
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,240
time constraint as a barrier

952
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,640
it's a friendly reminder for everyone

953
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,599
regarding the four

954
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,680
questions in that form to submit the

955
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
google form for the exercise

956
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,119
it doesn't have to be perfect it's

957
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,839
starting point

958
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,079
and of course i want to send the lucky

959
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,119
winner swag

960
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,720
rings the last section of my talk

961
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,920
is what what you can do to build your

962
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
brand through five simple tips there's a

963
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
lot more tips as you heard from everyone

964
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,280
that i shared earlier but i've condensed

965
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
it into five i've summarized into five

966
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,680
tips

967
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,079
the first one tip number one

968
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,119
in the exercise i started off with think

969
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,240
about your why

970
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,960
think about your purpose connect with

971
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,720
your audience through your passion

972
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,079
but focus on your purpose your purpose

973
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,520
should not be about getting that

974
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,839
promotion

975
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,400
focus on how you can solve a problem

976
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,440
inspire your audience to make an impact

977
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,480
that will make this a better place

978
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
the opportunities will follow you

979
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,680
tip number two promote

980
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,760
so promote not only yourself but promote

981
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
others

982
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,720
today i'm promoting these individuals

983
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,800
because we're all contributing to make

984
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
this a better

985
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,359
industry as i shared earlier

986
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,200
you don't need to be a public speaker or

987
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,599
that extrovert to be able to promote

988
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,640
your brand there are many platforms

989
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,079
such as blogs books videos research

990
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,359
social media project work volunteering

991
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,599
many individuals fear bragging or

992
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,040
self-promotion because of

993
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,560
imposter syndrome or humility

994
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,680
for me what helped me with imposter

995
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,960
syndrome

996
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,200
is to always bring it back and remember

997
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
that why

998
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,440
remember why i'm doing this and think

999
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,560
about the change

1000
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,480
you will bring to make this a better

1001
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,839
place

1002
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,359
a great quote i'd like to share from rbg

1003
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,960
that i'd like to quote is fight for the

1004
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,040
things you care about

1005
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,240
but do it in a way that it will matter

1006
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
similarly when you think about

1007
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
self-promoting or bragging

1008
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
do it in a way that it will matter don't

1009
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,160
be afraid

1010
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
the first time will feel weird it will

1011
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
feel awkward

1012
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
but as you continue you'll notice that

1013
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,320
it isn't viewed as bragging

1014
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,480
people will start knowing you for your

1015
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
contribution

1016
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,000
tip number three be

1017
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,440
authentic don't change who you

1018
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,440
are keep your values stay true to who

1019
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,760
you

1020
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,320
are your uniqueness is your strength

1021
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,440
you heard from the stories earlier on a

1022
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,720
great comment

1023
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,800
from elissa that she had shared when i

1024
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
was chatting to her and interviewing her

1025
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,800
is find your weird hence the picture

1026
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,839
find what makes you unique and be

1027
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,640
yourself

1028
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,560
don't feel that you have to look and be

1029
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,480
like someone else in order to build your

1030
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,880
brand

1031
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,680
tip number four

1032
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,240
this is a very important one that i saw

1033
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,839
as a barrier for so many

1034
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,960
dedicated time to invest in yourself

1035
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,880
don't let time constraints get in the

1036
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,440
way of investing in yourself

1037
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,760
you'll be surprised how much you can

1038
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,119
accomplish

1039
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,000
when you dedicate 15 minutes a week for

1040
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,240
self-development

1041
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,440
dedicate time to build your network

1042
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,599
so that so that you can inspire your

1043
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,280
audience

1044
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
it doesn't have to be a larger network

1045
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,960
right as i said even one that you

1046
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
inspire

1047
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,160
right you've seen how each one of us are

1048
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,839
leveraging different channels

1049
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,800
to reach our audience from speaking

1050
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
engagements to being an author

1051
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,240
from creative educational songs music

1052
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,960
video

1053
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,599
to youtube channels building your

1054
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,240
network

1055
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,440
doesn't have to be networking after

1056
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,079
hours

1057
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,720
at a bar with small talk i heard a talk

1058
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,839
earlier on

1059
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,920
where one of the speakers said that's

1060
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,119
not her thing

1061
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,720
so building your network doesn't have to

1062
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,119
be that the pandemic has

1063
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,160
actually helped us think creatively on

1064
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,880
how to network and connect

1065
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,800
it could be through creating a slack

1066
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,040
group within the organization with a fun

1067
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,839
element

1068
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,240
like a scavenger hunt or something that

1069
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,839
you like for example

1070
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,800
pets there's one slide group that was

1071
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,920
created on pets i

1072
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,400
joined it and executives and different

1073
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
people

1074
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,319
we're all sharing our pets but

1075
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,200
indirectly

1076
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,119
that's actually a form of networking

1077
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,640
we're getting to know people who we

1078
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,839
don't know

1079
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,480
with something common hey i could talk

1080
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,280
about my

1081
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,240
pet all day long so we could be

1082
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,680
scheduling a 15 the other

1083
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,599
thing is it could be scheduling 15

1084
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,800
minutes virtual meetup with somebody

1085
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
you know in linkedin for example maybe

1086
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,640
you've been watching their linkedin

1087
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,680
you like their posts you know connect

1088
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
with them reach out to them

1089
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,839
that's what i did with alyssa for this

1090
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,359
interview

1091
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,440
another great way to build your network

1092
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,960
is through volunteering

1093
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,599
opportunities some of the speakers

1094
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,040
talked about that

1095
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,240
for example i saw the conference

1096
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,720
in october for the diana initiative is

1097
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,160
looking for volunteers

1098
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,760
that is another great way to build your

1099
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,880
network get involved at local cyber

1100
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,960
security groups

1101
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,280
if there isn't a local cyber security

1102
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,240
group or

1103
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,040
a local group create one that's what i

1104
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,640
did with she that's what i did with some

1105
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,839
of the other ones

1106
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,680
that i created you'll be surprised how

1107
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,040
many people will jump at it

1108
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,040
right tip number five

1109
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,800
find a mentor and a sponsor

1110
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,359
a lot of talks have uh and speakers have

1111
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,000
talked

1112
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,960
a lot about this

1113
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,359
dedicate that time with them a sponsor

1114
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,920
is someone who is talking about you when

1115
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,800
you're not in the room

1116
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,079
i actually conducted a survey as i was

1117
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,200
curious why

1118
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
everyone doesn't have a mentor or a

1119
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,040
sponsor

1120
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,119
and the results i'll share the results

1121
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,880
of my survey

1122
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,119
i don't have the screenshot but just to

1123
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,640
share some of the numbers

1124
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,440
25 of the respondents said they do not

1125
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
have enough time in the day

1126
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,560
it's a time constraint right

1127
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,599
and 25 said they weren't sure how to

1128
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,520
approach someone

1129
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,160
if you heard yesterday's uh closing

1130
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,280
keynote

1131
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,240
the speaker shared ways on how you can

1132
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,599
find a sponsor

1133
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,720
or find the right mentor there are many

1134
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,319
security chapters

1135
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,640
like isaka or your own organization

1136
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
that will be offering a mentoring

1137
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,720
program

1138
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,760
last year in my own personal journey

1139
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,119
last year i was submitting so many cfps

1140
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,839
and i was working on building my brand

1141
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,240
and

1142
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,079
some were getting accepted others were

1143
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,839
not getting accepted

1144
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,440
i was actually looking for a mentor who

1145
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
could guide me

1146
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,560
in speaking engagements in in getting my

1147
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,040
talks accepted right

1148
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
and the idea was not about getting my

1149
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,880
talks accepted but it was more about the

1150
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
learning side to it

1151
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,240
right because this is something new that

1152
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,720
i was doing last year

1153
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,960
and it was perfect timing it was more

1154
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
just a learning opportunity what could i

1155
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,920
do what am i missing what do i not know

1156
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
and the diana initiative conference

1157
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,200
offered a mentorship program for

1158
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,079
speakers

1159
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,160
i raised my hand i took advantage of it

1160
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,599
right away

1161
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,839
for me it wasn't like i said it wasn't

1162
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,359
about my talk getting accepted

1163
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,240
it was a lot more i learned so much

1164
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,040
about abstract writing from my mentors

1165
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,640
and i can tell you that the sessions

1166
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,680
were so valuable

1167
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,000
also share as i was building my brand

1168
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,520
you know just this mentoring sessions

1169
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,800
that i was getting

1170
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,240
from from my mentors and sponsors

1171
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,440
really made a great impact right

1172
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,200
so i'll share another story of how i

1173
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,760
found my sponsor

1174
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
i would speak a town hall within the

1175
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,040
organization to

1176
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,920
educate and raise awareness of the

1177
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,040
importance of

1178
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,880
di in the workplace through xi

1179
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,200
and one of the executives had asked me

1180
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,760
if i would be willing to mentor him

1181
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,520
now this is a process called reverse

1182
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,760
mentoring where an executive

1183
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,200
is reaching out to be mentored right

1184
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,240
i was his mentor and he actually became

1185
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,760
my sponsor

1186
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,359
and for leaders out there i highly

1187
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,000
recommend trying this out

1188
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,880
for him what he gained was he was able

1189
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,000
to see things through my

1190
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,800
lens and i was able to see things

1191
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,599
through his lens

1192
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,800
my second sponsor that i found i didn't

1193
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,119
even know he was my sponsor

1194
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,160
as as as i mentioned as a founder of xi

1195
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,280
i presented to the board

1196
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,680
i had never formally been introduced to

1197
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,400
any of the board members prior

1198
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,560
there was one of the board members that

1199
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,480
i found out through

1200
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
our chief people officer that he was

1201
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,400
actually championing my initiative

1202
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
to his network so i reached out to him

1203
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,800
to thank him and now i'm actually

1204
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,000
dedicating time

1205
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,280

1209

1211
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,720
without you making the ask

1212
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,040
a mentor won't tell you what to do but

1213
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,640

as a result of building your brand and

1237
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
you will notice the impact

1238

as a result of building your brand

1239

which is to be to be the change and make

1242
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,559
an impact to close the gap for

1243
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,319

1245
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,359
i'd like to share my quote gender

1246
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,800
diversity should not be a woman's

1247
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,160
problem to solve

1248
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,119
or an hr issue to handle shouldn't be a

1249
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,240
legislation

1250
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,119
to be implemented or a movement to occur

1251
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,720
it should be everybody's problem to

1252
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,599
solve

1253
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,520

1254
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,760
