Leaders Lower the Ladder
Suchismita Pahi
 

2
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:25,040
EAN: Excellent. So, wonderful. We're at the end 
of the day, day one, The Diana Initiative 2021,  

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,840
Spark a Journey. My name is Ean Meyer. 
I'm thrilled to be here to bring in our  

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,800
next speaker and close out the day. It's been 
amazing. It's wonderful to see all these people  

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,599
sharing their knowledge. But as today closes, 
we really need to talk about a few things. One,  

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,960
we need to talk about our sponsors. Our incredible 
sponsors such as our track sponsors on the screen  

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,000
that make the tracks possible. We need to talk 
about the recording sponsors. If you heard a great  

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,560
talk, I want to share this with somebody later. 
These are the sponsors that are helping make sure  

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,440
and even sure that the videos get up on to the 
Internet. They're available so you can check  

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,480
them out later and share them with friends and 
further share those messages and, of course, all  

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,760
of your sponsors. All of you registered. You might 
have registered for free or for $5 and getting all  

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,480
the content and all the activity. These are the 
people making it happen. Please visit them in  

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,120
the expo hall. They have cool things, and we 
would love to show them all the love you can.
 

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
Tomorrow, this is the end of the day, 
we're gonna close it out on a great note.  

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,039
But tomorrow, 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. Pacific time, 
that's 10:30 a.m. eastern time in the networking  

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,160
area, there will be a great social hour. You 
can go to Diana Initiative.org/social hour to  

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,479
find out about that. And the DJ chillout 
room starts at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday.  

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,600
That's 11:30 a.m. eastern time. And kick off the 
day with the amazing Stephanie, info Steph, at  

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:15,200
Steph and sec on the Twitter. And talk about 
how you are the prize and how to hire the right  

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:23,200
boss for employer for a more fulfilling career. 
Two way street. If you like anything I'm saying  

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,040
or heard today, please give a huge thanks to the 
volunteers, the staff, the sponsors, everyone who  

22
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:38,640
has been online making this a great experience.
If your pockets are itchy with money, I don't  

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:49,440
want it anymore, please to go Diana Initiative.org 
and donate. Donate that way so we can deliver this  

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,840
incredible experience next week. If you need more 
information, go to Dianainitiative2021.sced.com.  

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,600
But frankly, there's enough of me 
talking. In stream we have Suchi Pahi,  

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:19,040
an attorney with a passion for tech. We are 
allowed to record. This is a privacy attorney.  

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,160
So make sure it's good. We'll come back for Q&A 
afterwards and some other notes. But please,  

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,720
Suchi, it's a privilege to introduce you and we're 
looking forward to hearing what you have to say.
 

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,720
SUCHI: Thanks so much. I'm going to echo for 
hanging out for Steph's talk tomorrow morning.  

30
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,840
It will be awesome. There is a common theme. 
Before we dive into leaders lower the ladder.  

31
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,519
There's a theme, how to pitch yourself, be 
marketable and be the best you that you are.  

32
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,640
And, you know, you can do a lot.  

33
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,239
But when you're in a leadership and a management 
position, you can do even more. And when you  

34
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,440
find a sponsor, you can do even more. And so, 
what we're gonna talk about today is building  

35
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,079
and retaining diversity in the cybersecurity 
community. And I say "Diverse," I'm talking about  

36
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,440
socioeconomic, ethnic, religious, gender. Anything 
you can think to have given more perspectives.
 

37
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:27,280
A lint about myself, I'm Suchi Pahi. 
I'm on Twitter. That's my handle, I  

38
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,960
don't tweet about information or cybersecurity 
anymore. I will tweet about IR, it's mostly  

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,520
nature and cute animals and existential crisis on 
Mondays and Fridays. If that's your thing, hit the  

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,640
follow button and you can ask questions about this 
talk or data privacy or cybersecurity in general.  

41
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm not your lawyer. This is not legal 
advice. And who is this talk for?
 

42
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,440
So, you, who are listening, this talk is for 
you. It's for execs. It's for senior leadership,  

43
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,680
it's for middle management and it's also for 
junior team members. While you might be as a  

44
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,080
junior team member not in a position to, from a 
leadership point of view bring more people into  

45
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,280
the community, you will also    you'll actually 
get the skill set you need to advance your own  

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,799
professional development during the course of this 
talk. And you'll be able to, soon, be in a middle  

47
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,920
management or senior leadership position. And take 
the steps that I'm going to talk about today.
 

48
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,160
All right. So, we all know that there's a problem 
with diversity in this cybersecurity community.  

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,880
But what is the big picture really like? It's one 
thing to see like a headline here or there or hear  

50
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,480
about it from a friend or hear about it at your 
company. But what is it really like in the world?  

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
And here are a few facts. So, 20% of 
the US cybersecurity workforce was  

52
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,680
made up of women. And this was a 2019 report. 1% 
of senior management in cybersecurity is women.  

53
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,800
And this was a 2020 report. And only 4% of the top 
companies    and this is outside of cybersecurity,  

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,480
so, just across the companies entirely in the 
US have people of color at the C Suite level.
 

55
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,080
I don't know what the breakdown is for any of the 
other forms of diversity. Including things like  

56
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,440
neurodiversity. But it's pretty shocking 
to take a look at these numbers and say,  

57
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,760
1% of senior management is women in cybersecurity. 
That's a wild ride to me. Especially when you  

58
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,800
think about how many women you see at local 
BSides or tool meetups or things like that  

59
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,640
in our actual community who could be senior 
leadership. And the question is, why aren't  

60
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,919
they? And how do we get them there? And that's 
something that I want you to really keep in your  

61
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,120
forefront of your mind as we 
go through the rest of this.
 

62
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,920
So, why should you care about diversity at 
all? Any kind of diversity? First and foremost,  

63
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,040
products and services will be better. And I'll 
give you a relatively life example of this.  

64
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,000
Actually two examples of this. So, in one of 
the work places that I've worked in before,  

65
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,240
I was helping a team that was doing some marketing 
for a product. And the team was a group of young,  

66
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,800
white, cis gendered men. There were no women on 
the team. And there were no minorities    other  

67
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,800
minorities    on the team. And they developed this 
one pager that was basically meant for end users.  

68
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,920
And it talked about women's pregnancy and, 
you know, not having enough time to do work.  

69
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,240
And it did it in a very tone deaf way that came 
across as both creepy and marginalizing women  

70
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,960
when they were pregnant. And no one caught it 
until it landed several seniority levels up  

71
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,320
at my desk in my hands. And I looked 
at this paper and I was like, you know,  

72
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,320
we're three lines in. And I'm skeeved out by 
what we're saying about the particular product.  

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,200
If they didn't have any perspective, that 
line would have stayed in. That's an example  

74
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,159
of a direct example on a product or service. And 
there are many of those that you'll see throughout  

75
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,040
the tech lifecycle. So, when someone's starting 
a product and taking it through their roadmap  

76
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,320
and building it and having it vetted and stuff.
If you don't have the woman or    by the woman  

77
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,120
I mean women. Or people with different 
ethnicities and socioeconomic classes,  

78
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,359
then you won't have somebody to spot the issues 
because it's not something within the world view  

79
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,240
or the environment of the other people who 
are involved. Another example of that is,  

80
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,840
perhaps very well known. It was when Snapchat 
had its automatic like geolocation sharing option  

81
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,560
turned on. And a lot of folks were like, hey. 
If we're Snapchatting people, we don't mean  

82
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,880
to share our geolocation with them as well. Like 
that's really creepy. Why is it automatically on?  

83
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,720
And most of the uproar came first from women.  

84
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,000
And then a lot of women's advocacy groups, when 
   who deal with like domestic violence victims.
 

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,480
And this could have been spotted 
before if, again, you'd had part  

86
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,560
of that population involved in at least the 
product development or the product vetting.  

87
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,120
So, that's the first reason you should care. The 
second reason is, it's actually beneficial to your  

88
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,000
company financially if you have diversity within 
your group. So, ethnically diverse companies are  

89
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,840
35% more likely to earn above average revenue. 
Similarly, gender diverse groups, or companies,  

90
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,800
are 15% more likely to earn above average revenue. 
Both of these are US statistics. And it was a  

91
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,359
study done by McKinsey. That's a significant chunk 
of change. And so, if just the simple act of being  

92
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,840
more inclusive and more diverse and helping people 
become part of the cybersecurity community can  

93
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,080
result in this amount of revenue increase, then 
as a senior or    senior leader or an executive,  

94
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
there's a huge incentive 
and a easy pitch to make for  

95
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,520
concrete targets at the board level for 
increasing diversity. And making changes to the  

96
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,160
way job offerings are written and how you handle 
retention of minority groups in your company.
 

97
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
So, number one and number two 
are a little bit soulless.  

98
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,280
I have to admit. So, they're very corporate. 
And maybe number three, the why I should care  

99
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,040
point, will hit home a little bit better for some 
of y'all. And that is you want to pay it forward.  

100
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
For those of you who are in minority 
groups and have made it and have succeeded,  

101
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,480
it's really helpful to have this mentality of 
helping other people get to where you are now.  

102
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,920
And benefiting your community overall. And that's 
something that maybe won't jive for many people.  

103
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
Maybe it does. It's something that I personally 
really prefer and that's been my philosophy  

104
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,920
from the get go. If I can share the 
knowledge, if I can sure the information,  

105
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,520
if I can help someone else also succeed, 
then I would like to do that. Especially when  

106
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
these are opportunities that can help lift your,  

107
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,280
you know, friends' entire family from working a 
minimum wage job and really having to struggle  

108
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,400
to something that pays well. They can afford 
healthcare and set their time. All of that stuff.
 

109
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,839
So, I think that's really important. And that's 
why the title of this talk is Leaders Lower the  

110
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,560
Ladder. What I want you think about when you 
hear that is someone at the top of like a cliff  

111
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
with a ladder and someone at the bottom that have 
cliff who wants to climb that ladder. And your  

112
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,560
options there are to just ignore that person. 
You can kick off the ladder. You can be a total  

113
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,640
douche. Or alternately, you can say, 
hey, why don't you check out this ladder.  

114
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,319
Here's how I got there. And I will help you along 
the way. And so, what we're gonna talk about is,  

115
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,040
how you can actually be the leader who is lowering 
the ladder and helping people up behind them.
 

116
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:38,720
So, what do you actually do? One or more of the 
following three. And we'll get into them in detail  

117
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,560
soon. So, the first is sponsor a mentor. Be 
a part of community outreach or education.  

118
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,560
And the last one is practice empathy. And really 
it should underlay everything you do. But I have  

119
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
it as a separate bullet point so we can really, 
really talk about it and go through some examples.  

120
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,440
One caveat of all of this is, the best 
sponsors are people who are well positioned,  

121
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,760
high earning, and tend to be more 
established in their careers.
 

122
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,840
That currently, because of the lack 
of diversity in our field means  

123
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:24,320
your typical white cisgendered male. Sometimes 
female. But at a much lower number. And so,  

124
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,480
you may find yourself feeling a little bit 
uncomfortable because you are trying to make  

125
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
a friendship or a relationship with someone that 
you're    you don't have a lot in common with,  

126
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,080
et cetera, et cetera. But that's part of 
being a sponsor and part of sponsorship.  

127
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,840
The other flipside of that is, if you're part 
of a minority group and you are seeking to be  

128
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,720
more active in increasing diversity, there could 
be potential backlash because of implicit bias.  

129
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,640
These are things to be aware of. It's up to 
you to decide how much it bothers you and the  

130
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,160
next steps. That's only for sponsorship and 
mentorship. If you choose instead to be part  

131
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,760
of the community outreach and education, then you 
can do that with probably more limited backlash.
 

132
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,880
Okay. So, I talked about sponsorship 
and mentorship without actually telling  

133
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,240
you what it was. Let's get into 
sponsorship versus mentorship.  

134
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,040
So, sponsorship is a type of mentorship that's 
more active. So, if I was a sponsor for you,  

135
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,599
I would know about your career. You will probably 
be part of your company. And I would say, hey.  

136
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,600
You know, Joe, have you seen Melissa's work? It's 
really amazing. Look at this project she just  

137
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,960
did. And I would put your work in front of Joe 
and say I couldn't have done this without her.  

138
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,480
That's a way of sponsoring my direct 
report, junior colleague, whoever.  

139
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,360
And really making you    or Melissa here 
   more visible in the organization than  

140
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,840
she might have been otherwise.
So, you want a sponsor to promote  

141
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,840
work contributions to others. Help you 
navigate politics in the organization.  

142
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,920
Assign or delegate high visibility projects that 
could be stretch projects. And by stretch, I mean,  

143
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,599
maybe you don't think you can do that project or 
lead that project, but if I'm your sponsor and  

144
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,080
I think you know what? You're really capable. 
You've gotten so much other stuff done. Like  

145
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,000
this project will be great for you to try to do. 
Then I would encourage you to take that project.  

146
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,359
And then, of course, there's the raise 
the direct report for promotions.
 

147
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,440
And these are all the things that if you're a 
sponsoree, you should look for from a sponsor.  

148
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,320
Like if there's someone who has been inviting 
you to panels or giving you some of the more  

149
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,920
high visibility projects, that person is probably 
acting more as a sponsor than just a mentor for  

150
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,640
you. And if you're a sponsor, you should 
use these as a way to frame your approach  

151
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,640
to mentoring your direct reports or your 
team members or colleagues or whomever it is  

152
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:11,120
so that you can be that actual added benefit 
for that person. So, you can see the fruits of  

153
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
the work that you're doing and get that person to 
where you are or where you think they could be.
 

154
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,160
And then we have mentorships and mentors more 
generally. Mentor who is aren't sponsors are  

155
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,640
typically more advisers. They provide 
constructive feedback to the mentees.  

156
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,920
It's a two way relationship. It tends to be a 
longer relationship. And mentors can be inside  

157
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,520
the organization or outside the organization.
When I was in a law firm, I had been given that  

158
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,960
advice to always have an in law firm mentor and 
an out of law firm mentor. And I took that advice  

159
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,240
seriously. And in the end, it made one of the 
biggest differences in my career. So, my in the  

160
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,160
law firm mentor helped me navigate what law firm 
committee I should be a part of. Who to work for?  

161
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,679
Do people actually participate in this 
firm wide event and stuff like that.  

162
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,200
That was important for navigating life inside of 
the law firm. But I just happened to meet another  

163
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:20,480
attorney who was a older Asian attorney out of 
a different office of ours at a conference. And  

164
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,680
he and I hit it off. He was very kind and 
very thoughtful and gave great advice.  

165
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,360
And when I was ready to move from 
the law firm and I'd expressed  

166
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,800
some of my reservations on why I was trying to 
move. He was encouraging and gave me advice from  

167
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,600
his own life experiences that helped me make some 
decisions that were big changes. So, having that  

168
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,439
inside the firm mentor was great. I couldn't 
go to my inside the firm mentor and say  

169
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,360
I want to leave. This sucks. But I could do 
that with the outside the law firm mentor.
 

170
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,960
We're still friends. He will call 
and say I'm moving to this company  

171
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,240
and moving to this field. Since we met, he's 
successfully transitioned from intellectual  

172
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:14,880
property practice, patents, IP and trademarks 
   copyright afraid marks into privacy and  

173
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,840
cybersecurity as well as intellectual property. 
So, it was a two way relationship for us as well.
 

174
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,480
So, I really emphasize sponsors. And this is an 
example of why I think sponsors are so important.  

175
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:40,239
So, as you can see from this graphic, 119% 
of the sponsorees were more likely to have  

176
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,160
their ideas developed. And 200% more 
likely to see their ideas implemented.  

177
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,080
These are some incredible numbers. It's not just 
a marginal return if you're a sponsor. You're  

178
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,879
really making a significant difference in helping 
a minority group or a person from a minority group  

179
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,360
find success in whatever 
industry or company you're in.
 

180
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,600
And that's not to really just dig on mentorship. 
Mentorship is also critical. There are studies  

181
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,959
showing that folks are better prepared for 
promotions. They have higher success rates in  

182
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,280
their field. They have better job satisfaction, 
better performance and they're more likely to  

183
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,840
stay with the company. And frequently, you hear 
people talk about high turnover rates. I trained  

184
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,959
this person and then they left and all of that 
stuff. But if you've built strong relationships,  

185
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,760
you can predict whether a person is leaving 
because they're probably going to tell you. And  

186
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,560
you can also have people for a little bit longer. 
There will be a sense of loyalty and trust and  

187
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,320
respect. But that has to be fostered. And that's 
part of where mentorship can play in as well.
 

188
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,399
So, how do you make mentorship or sponsorship 
work? I originally wasn't going to include  

189
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,720
this slide, but I remembered several times people 
were like, I had a mentor. I talked to them once.  

190
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,640
I really didn't get anything out of it. 
Making mentorship or sponsorship work  

191
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,840
takes effort and knowledge from both of 
the people engaged in this whole thing.  

192
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,800
You can have company formal mentorship programs. 
Those will help establish more concrete goals that  

193
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,720
the mentor and the mentee can try to meet. Hey, 
have meetings twice a month. Someone come with  

194
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,560
questions they have. Or have coffee once 
a month. Whatever it is. You can set these  

195
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,560
goals for the people who are participating. And 
you'll actually start to get returns because  

196
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,120
folks will start to build relationships. There 
should also be a feedback and review process  

197
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,840
in that. Ideally anonymous. In case there are some 
problematic pairings. Because not everyone has the  

198
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,800
chemistry to build a good professional 
relationship in a mentorship and mentee situation.  

199
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,720
There's also informal mentorship. And 
this can be peer to peer mentoring.  

200
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,480
An example of this is my former colleague 
who has since moved to another company,  

201
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,800
he and I would sit, and we would talk about 
internal company initiatives. Who is buying  

202
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,240
into what? What kind of budget for different 
products? And have an exchange of information.  

203
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,960
You know what? If I was going to tee up 
this project, here's the way to do it.  

204
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,160
That was an informal peer to peer mentoring. 
He didn't have to share it with me.  

205
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,800
It was not he knew how to do it better or 
was smarter. But I've seen this work for me,  

206
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,040
maybe it can work for you. Why don't you give 
it a try? Peer to peer mentoring is great.  

207
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,600
Certain colleagues from a field can be more 
helpful in informal mentoring and sponsorship.
 

208
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,760
If you're the mentee, those not in 
executive or senior leadership positions,  

209
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,280
when you're in a mentorship relationship, 
you should really try to have  

210
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,040
an idea of what questions you want to have 
answered and what you want out of the mentor and  

211
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,120
mentee relationship. Is it someone you can talk to 
about life changes? Is it someone you can talk to  

212
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,040
about specifically your one specialty area within 
your field? Is it someone who can help you engage  

213
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,720
more with the broader community? Is it someone 
you can call when you have a problem? Those  

214
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,280
are the types of questions you should be asking 
yourself so you can get the best out of that  

215
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,800
mentor and mentee relationship. The corollary 
that is, after you have figured that out.  

216
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Make sure to communicate it. Whether it's 
in writing, whether it's over the phone,  

217
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,080
whether it's in person. You have to tell your 
mentor, hey. This is what I'm expecting from this.  

218
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,600
Does that fit your expectations of 
this mentee/mentor relationship?  

219
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,159
Sponsors should be proactive 
and open their network.
 

220
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,160
If you're a sponsor, you hold a lot of influence 
and power. Probably more than you think you do.  

221
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,440
And you probably know other people in your network 
who hold a lot of influence and power. It's on you  

222
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,080
as the sponsor to proactively make introductions, 
set up one on ones. Or set up a group of three to  

223
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,560
talk. Or bring someone with you to a offsite 
get together that you and your friends are  

224
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,159
going, and you and this person could benefit 
from that conversation and relationship building.  

225
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,800
So, for sponsors, you have to be thoughtful when 
you're sponsoring a sponsoree to be effective.
 

226
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,200
And last but not least, mentors should 
active listeners and foster a relationship  

227
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,560
that is built on trust, respect and genuine 
friendship. We talked about that the last slide,  

228
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,159
but it's going to come up again.
 

229
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,800
Sponsorship and mentorship aside. That's the 
first way to lower the ladder. The other one  

230
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,560
is community outreach and education. So, 
types of outreach and education include  

231
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,160
giving classes. An example of this would be we 
have a local library here near my parents' home.  

232
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,440
And at the local library, the library has set up 
a basic computer skills classes for the first half  

233
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,600
of the day. That's not actually really convenient 
for people who have jobs during the daytime or who  

234
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,120
are working multiple jobs. And so, I would suggest 
if you're interested in teaching classes at your  

235
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,560
local school, trying to do it on the weekends or 
the local library, doing it on the weekends or  

236
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,960
doing it after hours. So, like a 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. 
slot so that people can make it to your classes,  

237
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,520
learn new skills and then try to build on 
them. And they don't have to be difficult.  

238
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Because you are steeped in the cybersecurity 
industry. Your average person really doesn't  

239
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,600
know what's going on. And making just a basic 
101 class is making cybersecurity accessible.
 

240
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Similarly, if you don't have the time to prep a 
class and teach a class, you could do something  

241
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,159
like a guest lecture. And guest lectures could 
be at the local community college or a trade  

242
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,920
school or however you want to set that up. 
And you can introduce a topic and explain it.  

243
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,360
And see whether you spark an interest and here we 
go, we're gonna spark a journey, in someone who is  

244
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:23,360
really excited or interested in what you've talked 
about. And guest lectures can also be just school  

245
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,360
visits at elementary or high school or middle 
school. And the benefit of that is having these  

246
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,360
young students who will see you and go, oh! This 
person really cares about this topic. And they're  

247
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,199
really successful in this and they look like me 
and this is exciting. And I want to do that too.  

248
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,080
It really exposes people to some other options 
than what they might be getting in school.
 

249
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,280
And then, of course, outside of those in person 
on time things in the education area for the  

250
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,200
general public, you have financial donations 
that you can do to different special interest  

251
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,000
groups. And I don't mean in the politics way. 
I mean, like women in information security or  

252
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,360
I think Black Girls Hack is the one that recently 
a friend of mine donated DEFCON tickets to. That's  

253
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,360
a great way to also do outreach and education in 
the community to support these groups that are  

254
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,040
doing the work, have the plans. And if 
you don't have the time, maybe you have  

255
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,360
the money. That's the way to do it.
Last but not least, conferences for  

256
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:29,200
non infosec communities. This one's a little 
bit weird, maybe, from the get go. But  

257
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:39,200
I'll give you an example. I did a law    cyber 
insurance and cybersecurity presentation for the  

258
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,720
accounting groups for the State of Texas. So, they 
were all CPAs. They have this big organization  

259
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,240
whose name escapes me right now. And I had 
emailed someone I knew in there and I said, hey,  

260
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,160
you know, this is actually pertinent to your 
industry. I just worked with a former client  

261
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,960
who was having some issues. And I thought it 
might be helpful to do a 101 on how to evaluate  

262
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:07,040
cyber insurance and what to be aware of from 
cybersecurity regs. Okay. Great. There I was at a  

263
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:15,360
non information security conference surrounded 
by accountants. Doing stuff I had never heard  

264
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,560
of and reading books I never heard of and lots 
of math. It was very out of my world, basically.
 

265
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
And gave a presentation, got some really 
interesting questions and some interesting  

266
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:35,600
feedback. And really got some of these accountants 
that I had met to be more interested in pulling  

267
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,120
the cybersecurity side of what they need to do 
accountants into their actual consulting practice.  

268
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,159
So, that was something exciting to see 
and great to help guide. And it's a way to  

269
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:55,280
bring your knowledge base from where you are now 
within the cybersecurity group to adults who are  

270
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,920
in non cybersecurity places and who can 
learn more and take what you're giving them  

271
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,640
and maybe eventually work their 
way into this field as well.
 

272
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm not sure if cybersecurity consulting 
is really part of the cybersecurity field.  

273
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm leaning yes because there are a lot 
of independent consultants and really  

274
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,320
effective consulting groups that 
do cybersecurity and data privacy.
 

275
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:24,560
All right. Empathy. It's in green. It's loud. 
And the reason they did this slide this way is  

276
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:32,399
somehow I want you to be aggressively empathetic. 
And that's a weird combination of words.  

277
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,439
But you'll get what I mean. So, what is empathy? 
According to the Center for Creative Leadership,  

278
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,880
it's the ability to experience and relate to 
the thoughts, emotions or experience of others.  

279
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,640
And if you're being empathetic, it 
means you are able to step outside of  

280
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,200
you and all the experiences that make you and 
the way you think and the way you judge people  

281
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,800
and put yourself in the shoes of 
another person and feel what they're  

282
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,840
feeling and understand why they're saying 
they're feeling the way they're feeling.  

283
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:12,240
Which is really a soft skill according to all of 
the outdated textbooks. But it's actually one of  

284
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,560
the most integral things that you can develop 
and practice and engage with in your career.
 

285
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,560
So, steps for empathy during communications. You 
want to actively listen. Which I remember from  

286
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,760
earlier when I was talking about mentorship, 
I said mentors have to actively listen.  

287
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,320
What's active listening? It's not taking 
notes. It's not repeating back what someone  

288
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,679
said like a parrot. It's trying to figure 
out what they're actually telling you.  

289
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,320
So, if I'm sitting across from a colleague 
and my colleague's like, ah, man, you know,  

290
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,840
I'm really tired. I'm very frustrated. And this 
just    this project is totally disorganized.  

291
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,560
I should be, when I'm listening actively to this 
colleague, I should be thinking about, okay.  

292
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:07,840
What is he really frustrated by? What    
what number of situations that I know about  

293
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,240
because we worked together on this project 
have resulted in this type of frustration?  

294
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:22,239
And my response might be, hey. Well, I understand 
that you're frustrated because blah, blah, blah.
 

295
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,160
And so, that's where I'll repeat back 
to this person, which is step two here,  

296
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,120
what I understand that the person's feeling. And 
this gives that person the opportunity to say,  

297
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:39,600
yeah. You totally get it. Or no. That's not what 
I mean. And at that point, which is step three,  

298
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,760
the other person that you're talking to try to 
em pathetically try to listen and engage with,  

299
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,200
will tell you again what they're feeling and get 
to the point where you're both on the same page.  

300
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,120
That person's been acknowledged and validated. 
And you can work together on a solution. Whatever  

301
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,879
negotiations you need to do. Or hey, maybe someone 
else needs to do this project instead. Or summon  

302
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,800
an apology, it's fine. If you start with the four 
steps, that's the simplest things, you'll be able  

303
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,879
to develop that still of empathy and being able to 
identify with people in a way that will help you  

304
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,240
make folks within your cybersecurity community 
or in your family circle or friends circle,  

305
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,760
wherever you practice these skills more 
comfortable and more loyal and more trusting,  

306
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,080
and they'll respect you more. And they'll be 
more likely to stay within the community.
 

307
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,840
Lowering the ladder doesn't mean just giving 
someone the steps of how you became successful.  

308
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,399
It means helping them and understanding what their  

309
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,720
barriers might be or what their troubles 
might be or what their abilities might be  

310
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,320
and helping them professionally develop in 
a way where they can end up where you are.
 

311
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,960
So, you have to demonstrate empathy. You can't 
just verbalize that you are empathetic and stop  

312
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,800
there. Your actions should actually reflect 
your empathy. And I've given you the bullet  

313
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,879
points of what I basically said previously which 
is you can practice empathy. It is effective.  

314
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
And it can be helpful in all of your 
communications or interactions with people.
 

315
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,280
And that's it. So, the key takeaways here 
are to practice empathy. Be a sponsor if  

316
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,399
you can. Or be a mentor. That's okay too. Or 
engage in community education and outreach.  

317
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,080
And that's it!
EAN:  

318
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,760
Awesome. Thank you so much. This is amazing. 
I think it's a wonderful way to close  

319
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,600
out the day. To talk about aggressive empathy. 
And the chat went back and forth. Everyone kind of  

320
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,840
lit up a bit about the idea 
of aggressive empathy. So,  

321
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,439
we're waiting to see    we're waiting to see any 
questions coming in. While those are coming in,  

322
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,159
I love your concept. It's essentially we talked 
beforehand about it's lifting while you climb,  

323
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,840
you know? It's understanding it's a 
two way street. It's understanding  

324
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:22,560
that you need to be part of it. And work with 
individuals to do that. Still looking here to  

325
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:29,840
see if there are any questions. But one of the 
things    I've got a few questions maybe for the  

326
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,439
audience here. Waiting for others. Here we go. 
Tara Roys. Is it actually necessary to feel what  

327
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,720
they are feeling in order to practice empathy?
SUCHI: That's a great question.  

328
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:53,840
I don't think I mean    well, I know I don't 
mean that if Ean was to burst into tears, I don't  

329
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,040
necessarily need to feel that level of sorrow 
or rage or whatever it is that's causing that.  

330
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,080
But I do need to figure out, Ean's sad. Why is 
he sad like this? What would it feel like if  

331
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,159
someone said or done the things that happened 
that made him this sad? Is it something I  

332
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:20,880
said or did? And get in the world of the head 
space that Ean is in and go from there. Because  

333
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
you want to be able to identify as closely as 
possible without being creepy and weird to what  

334
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,679
the other person is feeling so that you can build 
that link and actually address the problem in a  

335
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,560
way that's understandable and feels good to the 
other person. Feels like it resolves. Because as  

336
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,759
someone whose incredibly intellectual. That's 
not bragging, I'm sometimes completely missing  

337
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:56,080
the feelings. You can ask other people. Sometimes 
I struggle with that. If you're able to make that  

338
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,640
active step into feelings mode, you 
realize that your logical answer  

339
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,960
just makes everything worse. It's better to do 
it from the emotions and empathy standpoint than  

340
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,040
from the logical, separated standpoint.
EAN: Awesome. We got a question from a volunteer,  

341
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,240
I hope I'm pronouncing it right. Muteki. How 
you effectively communicate with folks in your  

342
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,560
community that resist DEI, diversity, equity and 
inclusion initiatives or don't want to have the  

343
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:34,720
conversation or think it's, quote, too political.
SUCHI: Yeah, you know, I haven't really struggled  

344
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,279
with that. I have been very lucky with having 
colleagues who will pick up on it and roll with  

345
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,200
it. I actually used to be one of the folks 
who didn't engage in diversity and inclusion  

346
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:53,359
efforts because I felt like there would be a 
backlash as a Indian woman in my field. And  

347
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,319
the reason I was able to step out of that was 
because there was a colleague I had who was  

348
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,080
very quiet. He was a quite cisgendered dude. 
Grew up privileged. All of that stuff. But he  

349
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,080
would go to all of these DEI initiatives. 
He would show up, he would have the swag,  

350
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,840
he always made an appearance. He didn't require 
his team members to show up with him. But just  

351
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,320
by setting that example, like I'm gonna do it this 
way. I'm not gonna use this kind of language. I'm  

352
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:29,360
gonna do blah, blah, blah. He really lived the 
ally life. And that got people to come do stuff  

353
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,560
that he would do. So, he, you know, got entire 
groups and teams and departments from our  

354
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,840
company to be present at like the 
Black inclusivity group that we had.
 

355
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:47,280
EAN: That's wonderful. Yeah, now, it's you    you 
really have to be part of the solution. Right?  

356
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,640
And it speaks exactly to your aggressive empathy. 
You have to aggressively tackle the problem. You  

357
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,480
have to say, I'm going to go and put myself out 
there. I'm going to try and learn and try and open  

358
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,720
my mind and go from there. Nicole, if you want to 
throw that book up on to the screen in the comment  

359
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:12,000
there. So, Penguin random house, we can't talk 
about that at work by Mary Frances Winters. If  

360
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,720
you're having that problem, Nicole recommends that 
book to how you broach those types of challenges.  

361
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,600
Great. Steve Christey Coley, SushiDude, 
how can people in individual contributor,  

362
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:38,560
C positions become mentors or sponsors. If you're 
a peer in the individual contributor positions,  

363
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,400
what would you suggest?
SUCHI: Yeah, I have an example.  

364
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:50,960
And I think extrapolate from it what you will. One 
of our junior security analysts. This was a prior  

365
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,560
company. He was learning some new skill set and 
it was really complicated and studying for exam.  

366
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,080
He had said to the other security 
analyst that he was working with. Man,  

367
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,360
this is really hard. I have been spending a lot 
of time with this. And I can't get anywhere. And  

368
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,920
what they did was they set up a weekly hour long 
group like office hour type thing. But they all  

369
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,960
worked on the same project with him to try to 
help him understand and learn it. They were all  

370
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,560
just security analysts. None of them managed 
other people. They were not people managers.  

371
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,200
He passed whatever exam that was. Everyone learned 
something new. They ended up becoming really good  

372
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,720
friends and were a really good team. I think 
that was a great way to mentor someone and  

373
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,520
help them. Even somewhat of a sponsorship thing. 
Because he was provided with resources that he  

374
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,800
wouldn't think to look at or have access to.
EAN: Sure. That is something that a lot of  

375
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,680
people don't realize. You don't have to 
be the leader or someone sponsoring them  

376
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:01,680
going to a conference or panel. Building that 
relationship, sharing your knowledge or whatnot.  

377
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:11,200
That's great. To that point, one of my questions, 
there's a trend that says you need a mentor  

378
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,680
that's above you, that can help guide you. And 
as much as you're mentoring someone who's coming  

379
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,960
to you with experience. Having someone who is 
generationally different. Maybe not a position  

380
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,120
to you. But maybe you're 20 years into your career 
and you're a student. And you can learn from them  

381
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,800
much about the new workforce coming in. How do you 
feel about that from a mentorship perspective?
 

382
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:46,080
SUCHI: I have benefited a lot from mentors who are 
at least one generation above me. And it's because  

383
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:53,759
there is a level of strategy and world know how 
that they have from their experiences that I don't  

384
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,240
have. Whether I'm good at my job or not. Or a 
technical expert in the field or not. Because  

385
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:08,240
there's    a lot of reading the currents of like 
corporate politics and things like that. Even if  

386
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,479
you're an individual contributor. That you have to 
be able to do. And you can get a jump on that by  

387
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,920
talking to colleagues who have been at companies 
for the last, you know, 60 something years.  

388
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,560
They just have a really good way of sussing out 
what's real and what isn't. I like that. I think  

389
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,279
intergenerational mentorship is really important. 
It works both ways. That one colleague who was  

390
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,720
super active in diversity and inclusive stuff, he 
helped one of our other colleagues figure out how  

391
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,839
to use Google Drive which is all we were using.
EAN: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. No, and  

392
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,200
I love that. And we've actually had 
some staff discussions about TikTok.  

393
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,919
Oh, here's a great question. Kevin, volunteer. 
So, question, is there something you recommend  

394
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,040
to mentees to be more coachable? That's a 
great question. What can someone do to make  

395
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:11,040
themselves kind of that ideal mentee?
SUCHI: From a mentor perspective,  

396
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:19,839
an ideal mentee, or someone who is more coachable 
is someone who can come to me proactively and say,  

397
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,279
hey. I want to set up a call. Can we talk about 
XYZ? And then actually follow through on that.  

398
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,880
And be forgiving when your mentors may not make 
an appointment or something like that or not be  

399
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,120
responsive. Ping them again. Be that active person 
who is following up over and over again. And then  

400
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,240
actually take the advice you're begin. And 
if you're not taking the advice you're given,  

401
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,320
have a fully thought out reason for, you know, 
why that advice doesn't really fit. And it's a  

402
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,800
conversation you can have. Like if you've set up a 
good mentor relationship or are setting up a good  

403
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,640
mentor relationship. It should be a conversation 
where you can say, you know, that doesn't sound  

404
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,240
like it place. Here's why it doesn't apply and why 
don't we think about this? And work that out in  

405
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:09,839
a conversation with your mentor. That's what is 
coachable. The openness, the willing to pursue.  

406
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,720
And then willingness to actually take the advice.
EAN: I like that. It's    you don't have to  

407
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,640
always take the advice. But you should let your 
mentor know why, you know? So we they don't say,  

408
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,160
I'm trying to help you and you're not listening. 
So, what am I spending my time for? Oh,  

409
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,400
I didn't have that perspective. I didn't know that 
about your background. I didn't know that about  

410
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,240
what you want to do. Let's take a different 
route. I love that. On that same note while  

411
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,359
we wait to see if some other questions pop 
up here and then we'll probably start to wrap  

412
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:50,720
up here. On that same note, we talked about 
how if you're not a leader in an organization,  

413
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,880
how you can, you know, do pure mentoring. But 
let's say you are a leader in an organization.  

414
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,520
The best way, how do you let people know that 
you're open to that? You know? What is it    is it  

415
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,560
groups inside your organization? Those diversity 
and inclusion groups? What would you suggest to  

416
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,560
kind of put the word out there that I would 
like to help, I would like to grow someone?
 

417
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,320
SUCHI: Yeah, I think I would have a two part 
approach. One would be actually telling people  

418
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,120
that I'm interested in having a mentee. Someone 
I work with. The other would be if I have  

419
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,839
one on ones or small group chats, actually being 
active in those one on ones or small group chats.  

420
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,360
And making yourself available. Here's my 
number, call me if you need anything. Call  

421
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,840
me if you have questions about this whatever 
work item. Making yourself accessible and  

422
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,080
showing your personality as a collegial, 
helpful person goes a long way for leaders to  

423
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,839
be more approachable in real life for 
mentees. And I think the other way is to  

424
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,960
other than communicating visually all of these 
things, it's to actually actively do stuff. If  

425
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,760
you're a leader and say you're invested in 
diversity and inclusion and in building out  

426
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:16,080
the community, then you should be setting solid 
metrics for your C level folks or your board and  

427
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,319
saying, we need to hit this threshold for hires 
from particular groups. Or we need to try to hit  

428
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,560
it. Or we need to have our outside recruiters make 
sure they're surfacing resumes from people with,  

429
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,960
I don't know, funky names or something like 
to. And I say funky names because I'm thinking  

430
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,627
western centric.
EAN: Sure.
 

431
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:40,000
SUCHI: But, you know, you have to put in these 
like measurable things that show that you're  

432
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,440
trying to actually make a difference with the 
power that you have. And then also, show up to  

433
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,240
those diversity and inclusion events. Like show 
up, be active. Be loudly supportive. If you are  

434
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,160
physically there or virtually there, then I can 
say, oh, this person's not just blowing smoke up  

435
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,920
someone's ass. They're actually gonna be there.
EAN: No, if you have privileges. Your privilege  

436
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,920
and your requirements to use that privilege to 
lift the next person. I couldn't agree more.  

437
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,680
Great. Are there example checklists, Nicole, 
are there examples checklists for figuring out  

438
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,480
a mentorship relationship? Something you can 
kind of go through and get to know each other.
 

439
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,680
SUCHI: You know, I    I think approaching a 
mentorship relationship is much like approaching  

440
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,680
any other relationship. So, if you see a red 
flag, don't keep hanging out with that mentor.  

441
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,319
And I mean, someone who like negates the way 
you say your feelings, negates your reality,  

442
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,040
gaslighting you, that kind of stuff. That's 
not the relationship you want to be in.  

443
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,800
That's for mentor and mentees. Typically your 
ideal mentor is the sponsor level person.  

444
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,840
But if they're not helping you take the stretch 
projects and not building you up and not putting  

445
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:06,960
you in front of the right people, then you need 
to stop putting energy there and go to develop  

446
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,000
a relationship with someone else who can do it 
better for you and who understands your goals.
 

447
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,720
EAN: Love that. No, absolutely. There was one 
note and we'll put this out here at this point.  

448
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,359
If there are any other questions or things that 
anyone would like to bring up, please put them  

449
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:27,200
in now. I'll bring up one additional thought to 
maybe have you expound on it because I loved what  

450
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,839
you said. You were talking about sitting with 
your mentor and having them share with you,  

451
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:39,040
this is what people are talking about. This is 
what this person likes. This is what their    I  

452
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:46,720
think the phrase you used was "Bought into." And 
I put in the chat, that cannot be understated.  

453
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,600
Having someone who is in the meetings that you're 
not, that has relationships that you don't saying,  

454
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,160
if you present it this way, you will be 
successful. If you present it this way,  

455
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,040
it will crash and burn. Because what 
you don't understand is the history.
 

456
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,680
Was I reading that right?  

457
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,319
Is that as important as I feel it is?
SUCHI: It is 1 hundred% important. And  

458
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,600
it is just as important as you think it is. All 
of the successful navigations I've done for like  

459
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,959
institution wide changes or even the simplest 
things have relied on historical knowledge that  

460
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,600
I didn't have. And that someone was willing 
to share. And that makes all    all of the  

461
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,520
difference. Like, hey, why is so and so checked 
out? They're moving to another startup in two  

462
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,040
weeks. That's not how you want to spend your 
energy. You need to talk to and so, and so who  

463
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,400
is taking over. If I would have known that I would 
have spent time with so and so who was levering.  

464
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,720
But instead I was able to build a relationship 
with someone else. That's a critical information  

465
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,839
when you're working inside of a work place.
EAN: Excellent. I think that probably that is a  

466
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,080
great place to end. I don't see any 
more questions in here. Wait, hold on.  

467
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,120
Okay. That was not a question. Okay. 
Very good. So, I'm going to put into  

468
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,160
the chat some links for everyone that 
we'll go through here just real quick.  

469
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:14,560
Suchi thank you so much for sharing. Thank you for 
coming on and spending your time educating us and  

470
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,360
sharing, you know, your perspective and 
background on this topic that is so important,  

471
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,320
you know, building those relationships. I'll 
probably be like doing some wrestler voice  

472
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,920
later where I'm like, aggressive empathy, 
oh yeah! You know? And I feel you!
 

473
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,640
That said, that brings an end to day 
one of The Diana Initiative 2021,  

474
