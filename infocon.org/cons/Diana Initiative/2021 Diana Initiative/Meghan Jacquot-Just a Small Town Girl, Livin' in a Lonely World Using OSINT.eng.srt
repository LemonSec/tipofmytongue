well our next speaker is megan chaco and

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,239
she is a curious lifelong learner who

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
happens to love to share what she finds

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
she will be speaking about some of those

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,719
things you can find

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
on ocean and how we can lessen our

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
footprint and take some of that back

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,719
uh there will be a question and answer

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
session following this

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,040

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,119
okay

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
so um we're not here to listen to music

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,960
but you can imagine that song kind of

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
playing through um and saying something

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
like just a small town girl living in a

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
lonely world

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
but we're going to shift it from it

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
being in that small town to really the

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,320
whole wide world the whole wide web and

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,720
using ocean tools to find yourself um so

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
i'm megan jackow um also known as cyber

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
tardis i work at cyber future foundation

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
i'm doing risk assessment cyber security

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,600
engineering um you can also find me at

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
carpe diem tech um so i'll be going

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
through a couple different things here

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
for my talk

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,920
so

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
um here we have um a brief outline of

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
everything we'll be discussing um so

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
i'll give a who am i a little bit more

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
in depth i'll talk about what is ocent

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
like what is this open source

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,199
information technology gathering that we

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,360
do what are some of the tools i will

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
demo some of those

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,520
um my lovely speaker wrangler will

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
actually be sharing the slides with you

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
all as well as a um google doc that i

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,040
created with resources the resources you

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
can also find embedded in the slides but

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
i created

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
a separate link as well so you'll kind

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
of get both of those

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
we will go over some data removal

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
requests and we won't actually do any of

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
those but i do have just some things for

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
how to do that

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
and then we'll look at some resources

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
for how to practice ocean if this is

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,959
really fascinating for you

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
and i'm happy to do some q a at the end

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,040
so if you have any things that you want

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,599
to drop um in chat or you're welcome to

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,080
ping me in slack um and then this is

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
just a disclaimer here um really think

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
about oceant for good um it should be

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
used for good it should be used for

72
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,519
helping others uh and of course like any

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,560
tool

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
it can be used in a negative way um so

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
everything that we go over today

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
everything that i'm working with you

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
today everything i'm teaching you today

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,519
is meant to be used as a tool for

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
positive use um and i do not intend to

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
have you use it in a nefarious or

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
negative manner

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,159
so just kind of keep that in mind that

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
of course with anything it could be used

84
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,720
for cyber bullying in a negative way

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
it could be used for

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,319
you know

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,080
different cyber attacks but that is not

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,920
the intent of any of this and i hope

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
that you go out there and you use it for

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,360
ocean for good um and that you're able

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
to maybe even help some with one of the

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
great organizations that does a lot of

93
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
this which is trace labs and i'll speak

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
about them at the end as well

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
okay

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,920
so who am i

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
um well i'm just i'm a person just like

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
any of you i'm very curious i love to

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,599
learn

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,200
and i've always kind of had this um path

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,159
just um inherently really just to who i

102
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
am to the point that my parents actually

103
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
gave me this nickname curious george

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
where i just i like to take things apart

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,720
and figure out how they worked um and

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,159
then you know sometimes build them back

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
but not always um and really just figure

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,040
out like oh okay this is exactly how

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
this works um i've always loved to

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
tinker um so i i'm you know at home um

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
you know as many of you are so around me

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
i have like my soldering kits um i've

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
got little devices i like to build

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
things um

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
you know both with physical um but then

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
from a software perspective as well

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
i like to help others

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,199
so i really do enjoy um thinking about

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
like where i am in my own journey and

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
where others are and how i can help and

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
give back that's very important to me

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
and i also believe that wherever you are

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
in your learning journey you can also

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,639
continue learning as well so kind of

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
this mentor mentee relationship and

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
always being a continual learner

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,479
i'm very passionate about being

128
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
proactive in information security so

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,759
looking at what the risks are trying to

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
mitigate them

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,520
trying to lessen that attack surface and

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199
then i find the cloud absolutely

133
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
fascinating

134
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,520
many things are moving to the cloud and

135
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
so how can we try to make sure that that

136
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
as

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
is as secure as possible

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,639
um and then i work with cyber future

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,039
foundation and i do risk assessment and

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,520
operations with them

141
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,400
and then my name is also cyber tardis um

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
i love doctor who i'm a doctor whovian

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,039
so i've got like a little tardis here um

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
something i've been super fascinated

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
with for a while i've seen every episode

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,919
that you can see um you can't actually

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,280
see every single episode because some

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,639
were lost

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,160
but i've even seen the ones that are in

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,600
audio so that's a little bit about me

151
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
and i just i love adventures enjoy space

152
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
done paleontological digs on airplanes

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,479
um

154
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
and you know i kind of enjoy running

155
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
doing different adventures so um if you

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
are an adventurer if you are a learner

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,039
if you're someone who loves all these

158
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,440
things um definitely seek me out and i'd

159
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
love to also connect with you

160
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,479
so

161
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,440
open source intelligence like i said

162
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,960
this is a way that we can help others um

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
it's a way that we can be curious

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
and you know we kind of a fun acronym

165
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
for this um

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
let me google that for you uh so where

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
does it come from like what is what is

168
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,639
its history

169
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
so open source intelligence comes out of

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,280
the world wars and it was something that

171
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
a lot of work was being done a lot of

172
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
data and information was being gathered

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
in regards to you know

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
we have these massive apparatuses being

175
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,720
formed

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
and

177
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
all these different divisions

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
and what do we do with

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
all the information that's being

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
gathered how do we make it actionable

181
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
what what types of things do we want to

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
do maybe we're going to have a mission

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,680
where we um you know completely send out

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
um a disguised corpse to

185
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,599
the banks of italy and make it look like

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,919
one thing is happening because we want

187
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,000
to make it look like

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,280
this is happening from an intelligence

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,960
standpoint and then we need to figure

190
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,599
out was that successful

191
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
so all sorts of different operations

192
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
happened that involved a tremendous

193
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,599
amount of intelligence gathering

194
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,599
i mean even from like a

195
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,120
let's look at different camouflage

196
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,919
techniques and see if they work from a

197
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
tactical standpoint

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,520
let's work with

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,599
public civilians and see

200
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,879
what works

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,560
and so when you think about some of the

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
big things that are happening

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,479
there is information gathered

204
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,759
there is

205
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
data that has been found

206
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,680
and

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
sources and um people who are cultivated

208
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
for that and then that was all kind of

209
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,479
like the history of it right so that

210
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,759
that's historical um a lot of this then

211
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
led to organizations being formed

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,599
out of the world wars so

213
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
specific to the u.s

214
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,400
we have um the oss being formed so this

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,199
is the office of strategic services that

216
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
later becomes the um the cia

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,639
the central intelligence agency

218
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,280
so that gets formed um that particular

219
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,319
for me was interesting from a personal

220
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
perspective since my grandfather was

221
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
career military and also career

222
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,519
intelligence and so he was involved in

223
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
parts of the oss being formed so from a

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,958
personal story perspective i find osint

225
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,240
very fascinating

226
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,279
then

227
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,800
we have

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
nowadays right so we have this

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
historical information gathering we have

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,560
archivists we have lots of data

231
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
we had librarians and archivists working

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
in the world wars

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
how does this relate to today

234
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,800
well some of the techniques that we have

235
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
for today

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
are that we have

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,040
advanced googling we have that you can

238
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
become a search master

239
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,440
we have different tools that have been

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
built

241
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,880
we have image reverse lookups so we're

242
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
going to work through some of these

243
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,600
different tools

244
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
and like i said

245
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
the theme for this conference is spark a

246
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
journey we are going to go on a journey

247
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,440
together about data

248
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
and look at what we can uncover with

249
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
some of these tools

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
and what we can do with that so that's

251
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,839
what we'll be doing next

252
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
so when we think about data and all the

253
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
data that's out there

254
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
there's so much data information out

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
there

256
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,959
and so

257
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
this is just a few years old so you can

258
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
imagine that

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
everything that's listed here from a

260
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
numbers perspective

261
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,839
is

262
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,200
even more

263
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,399
um

264
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,760
so

265
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,880
all

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
of the different platforms out there are

267
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,040
sending out petabytes of data

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,880
all these packages going back and forth

269
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
and back and forth

270
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
and

271
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
different ways that could be analyzed

272
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
and so we're going to look at some

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,920
different parts of that

274
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,519
we want to also make sure that we're on

275
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,040
the same page with definitions

276
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,079
so

277
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
first we start with

278
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,519
there's just a tremendous amount of data

279
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,640
out there

280
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,399
that's just you know

281
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
day-to-day data crazy tremendous amount

282
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
of data

283
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
so

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,320
data is the information

285
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,279
then

286
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,200
we have certain things that we need to

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
make sure that we're paying attention to

288
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
with that data so there are specific

289
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
laws that we need to be compliant with

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,720
so one example for that would be the

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,959
gdpr so the general data protection

292
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,040
regulation now this is specific to the

293
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
eu but because of the nature of

294
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,399
globalization and the way that those

295
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,160
data protections work

296
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
we actually have

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
implications for gdpr for all sorts of

298
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
parts of the world

299
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
and this is a data privacy law governs

300
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,839
the privacy of the data

301
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,480
we additionally have um people like

302
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
ourselves that work on making sure that

303
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,959
that data is secure right so security

304
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
then protects the privacy of the data

305
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
protects

306
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480
the cia of that data so you want to make

307
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
sure it maintains its confidentiality it

308
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
um stays the way it should be so it has

309
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
its great excellent integrity um and it

310
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,079
remains

311
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
for whatever uptime rules that you've

312
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
set it is available in the way it should

313
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
be available so all those things are

314
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,640
really important from a security

315
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
standpoint

316
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,360
so

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
you know we've

318
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
just spoken about

319
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
there's all

320
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
sorts of huge amounts of data out there

321
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
we've defined and now we're on the same

322
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
page with all of these different parts

323
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,160
of

324
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
data

325
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,639
now what we're going to do we're going

326
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
to continue on this journey

327
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
and we're going to look at

328
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
what we can do

329
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
with looking at some of this data so

330
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
this is where this ocean part comes in

331
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,040
and

332
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
you can look at data

333
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
about yourself

334
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,120
about others about organizations

335
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
i know someone gave a talk yesterday

336
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
about doing oceant for jobs so that can

337
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
be a really useful thing

338
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
to do when you are figuring out like oh

339
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
i'm on a job search and i need to learn

340
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,240
more information about the organization

341
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,079
so there's all sorts of ways that this

342
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,200
can be done

343
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,959
but of course remember my disclaimer at

344
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,160
the beginning

345
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,279
so what are going to be some of the

346
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
tools that we're going to look at

347
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
we're going to look at using the osint

348
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,800
framework

349
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
this is a just repository of tools

350
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,360
i'm going to take us through some

351
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
specific ones

352
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
i i know that these ones work

353
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,160
if you were to go through every single

354
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
node on this

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
you would then realize some of them are

356
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
broken some of them take you to the

357
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,079
internet wayback machine so

358
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,440
i'm not going to take you to any of the

359
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
ones that are broken that would not be a

360
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
good use of our time together

361
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
we're going to take a look at google

362
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,639
dorking this is a technique that can be

363
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,120
used with using specific search terms

364
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
we're going to look at chodan and we're

365
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
going to look at the harvester in kelly

366
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,079
linux

367
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,160
and do a little bit of

368
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
specific searching with that so that's

369
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
our plan and that's going to be the bulk

370
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
of what we're going to be doing today

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,680
now like i said

372
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,399
you should have shared with you um met

373
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,839
both the slides

374
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
and the resources

375
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,639
um

376
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,639
and so that should um give you access to

377
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
a copy of these slides with live links

378
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,199
and a copy of the resources

379
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,800
and so that should be really helpful for

380
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
you for following along

381
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,079
and

382
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
you're welcome to just listen but if you

383
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,760
want to be doing this at the same time

384
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,959
you're welcome to as well so

385
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,600
let's jump in and take a look

386
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
okay so this is the ocean framework

387
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,639
and i i think it is incredibly helpful

388
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,680
um

389
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
it like i said is a repository of all

390
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,000
these different things

391
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
and i'm not going to

392
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
search myself i'm not going to search

393
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
any of you

394
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,519
i'm going to search

395
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,560
a

396
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,600
generally well liked famous person

397
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
so i'm going to search tom hanks

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
so that that's who i chose for this

399
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
exercise that we're going to be doing

400
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,519
and

401
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,959
we're going to

402
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,279
use this here and you can see all of

403
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
these different nodes here

404
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,279
are filled in circles

405
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,120
what that means within the ocean

406
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
framework

407
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
is it means that when we click on one of

408
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,160
these

409
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
more things will populate so what we're

410
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
going to see

411
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,959
is i'm going to click on um

412
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,560
social network

413
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
so you can see that right here right

414
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,839
so

415
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,560
when you click on the word

416
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
it opens up so i'm going to do that are

417
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,680
you ready

418
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
this is the first step of the journey

419
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
into the tools

420
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,880
okay

421
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
so what we see now is we see a number of

422
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,720
things populated right

423
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
so

424
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,360
note

425
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,199
that this is now

426
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
an empty circle because all of its nodes

427
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,079
have been sent out

428
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
and then each of these circles

429
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,360
is full but not this one right

430
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
so that means that each of these has sub

431
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
nodes that you can keep going to so i'm

432
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,240
going to have us go to twitter

433
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,639
and same thing this one's been emptied

434
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,399
and we can see each of these

435
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,560
then i'm going to have us go to

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,959
the location mapping

437
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,360
and now we're at the point

438
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
where this is empty and all of these are

439
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,160
empty which means each of these is an

440
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,120
actual tool that we can go to

441
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,040
so we're going to click on the what one

442
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
million tweet map

443
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
and we can see a graphical user

444
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,480
interface map

445
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,519
that is searchable

446
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,680
so we're going to search tom hanks

447
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,519
and we're not going to add

448
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,040
any filters right away we're just going

449
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
to search first and last name

450
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
regular search

451
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,839
and we can zoom

452
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,320
in can do

453
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,040
geolocations

454
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,240
so you know tdi is usually on the west

455
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
coast in vegas we can see if anything's

456
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,759
happening in nevada

457
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,040
and we can actually look at these tweets

458
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,519
and we can see that because i didn't do

459
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,199
this with quotes we are getting

460
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
less specific

461
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,319
maybe than what i wanted right

462
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,760
so it's going to repopulate my search

463
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,119
with tom and hanks together

464
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,039
and then i can add in some of these

465
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,959
see day and night

466
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,400
and you can see that that vegas one went

467
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
away because it wasn't tom hanks

468
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
but we've got one in the middle of the

469
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
country

470
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
and we're speaking about a movie

471
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,919
okay

472
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,720
so

473
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,600
we have a middle the country tweet

474
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,720
and

475
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
we have a specific movie reference

476
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,080
so we actually have some geolocation

477
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,679
information

478
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
um

479
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,559
and right now we don't have any filters

480
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,080
or any other things other than the fact

481
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
that i've added on

482
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
making sure that we're doing an

483
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,679
inclusive search right that we're doing

484
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,640
the two words together okay

485
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
so

486
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
just kind of keep that in the back of

487
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
your head that we just did

488
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
a

489
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
geolocation tweet search

490
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
okay

491
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
now we're gonna do another one

492
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,400
and we're going to do what

493
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,440
one that is

494
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
twitter search

495
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
so you see that note here

496
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,880
and then we're going to do toogle

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
so google

498
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,840
twitter google

499
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
and then same thing

500
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,080
search tom hanks

501
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,679
and we can get to tom hanks twitter page

502
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
in english or the copied one

503
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
we're gonna go to his

504
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,000
um english one

505
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
um so we can see his twitter page

506
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,600
and we can see that he's not

507
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,400
as

508
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,480
often

509
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
on the twitter

510
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
but we can see that he was posting some

511
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,799
lovely things for the class of 2020 etc

512
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,000
okay

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
we can see some geolocation stuff here

514
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,480
too right with los angeles

515
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,760
so just kind of keep that in mind so we

516
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
have people

517
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
writing tweets about him in the middle

518
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
of the country

519
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
and then we have

520
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,840
him adding his location in california

521
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,159
okay

522
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
now we're gonna do one more

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,919
so we did search

524
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,440
we did this one and if you want any of

525
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,960
these to like go away just you have more

526
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
screen space you just click that word

527
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
then we're going to do a

528
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
location

529
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
and we're going to do the

530
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,360
geo tweets

531
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
and so this i wanted to just demo to you

532
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
so you can see some of them don't work

533
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,440
so

534
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
that's okay we're not going to do that

535
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
one

536
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
um

537
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
but we can kind of see that we get some

538
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,559
information in general from those two

539
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
from both the one million tweets

540
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
and from the one that we were just at

541
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,919
um where we were able to pull this

542
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,880
twitter

543
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
okay so the next thing we're going to

544
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,799
look at

545
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,360
is actually doing some

546
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,960
google dorking

547
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
and it's kind of a funny word um and

548
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
funny phrase and so that comes from

549
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
johnny long who is a hacker and he kind

550
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
of came up with it as an idea to

551
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,520
basically state

552
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
ways that we can

553
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
come up with

554
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
different ways to specify searches in

555
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
google that give us even additional

556
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
information

557
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
um

558
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
and so we'll take a look at some of

559
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
those

560
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,200
so

561
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,360
within the resources

562
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
i provided this that has

563
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
a whole bunch of the operators that you

564
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,799
can add in

565
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,840
and we're going to do a search that

566
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
searches both

567
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,679
name and

568
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,559
um

569
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,880
nickname

570
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
same thing we can add in

571
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
so you may have heard of

572
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,840
tom hanks called t hanks or t

573
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,480
hanksgiving sometimes

574
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
and so this is coming up i'm actually

575
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
going to switch this to not be in quotes

576
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,960
because i played around with it earlier

577
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
wasn't doing any quotes

578
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
yeah so now we're getting some results

579
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,520
with t hanks being a reference to tom

580
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
hanks and those going together

581
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,200
so this would work really nicely if you

582
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
were searching up information maybe

583
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,120
about yourself and you knew that you had

584
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
a particular nickname or maybe you went

585
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,559
by two names

586
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
and you wanted to do that search at the

587
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,880
same time so you could search both of

588
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
your different names and then add the

589
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,200
tilde um you know that we use like when

590
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
we're going back to home

591
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,080
um

592
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,880
and

593
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
then you want to have all those searches

594
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
happen at the same time

595
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,159
so um that's just one of the many

596
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,840
examples you can do

597
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
that can make google searching more

598
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
efficient can make you more of a master

599
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
at the google searching

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
um so

601
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
kind of keeping in mind that we have now

602
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
some information about

603
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,559
geolocation we have information about

604
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,919
names and nicknames that go together

605
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,880
what we're going to look at next

606
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
is we are going to look at

607
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,320
chodan

608
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,240
so that can be used in a couple

609
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
different ways

610
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,840
so we can use it in a map functionality

611
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,799
and

612
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,400
we had

613
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
before

614
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
that there was los angeles

615
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,279
where there was like kansas i think

616
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,919
you do las vegas

617
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,559
and so if you're not familiar with sedan

618
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,760
it is one of the tools that is used i

619
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
didn't create a slide on it um it's one

620
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,320
of the tools that is used to give

621
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,200
information about devices anything

622
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,760
that's connected to the internet and

623
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,120
then services processes countries

624
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
so it's a really useful tool for

625
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,159
searching

626
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,600
and um to become a member is

627
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,400
pretty inexpensive it's less less than

628
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
fifty dollars if i recollect correctly

629
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,559
and then if you wanna do even more

630
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,440
searches there's more expensive pricing

631
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,960
but um

632
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,640
from like a use perspective if it's

633
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,080
something that you think you might be

634
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,520
interested in it is

635
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,080
and i'm not like a representative or

636
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,559
anything um but

637
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,960
it can be useful for searching things

638
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,400
um

639
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,679
so

640
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,799
we identified the la um la las vegas

641
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,880
those are some places that we were

642
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,159
talking about

643
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,080
um and so

644
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,960
we can take a look at usage in those

645
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
areas now this is like a huge

646
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,760
generalized search but if you ended up

647
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
being really specific

648
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,799
with your geolocation tags

649
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,320
you could

650
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
get

651
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,240
some really specific information

652
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
about

653
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,440
these places

654
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,240
and so you could end up pairing

655
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
the knowledge that you just gathered

656
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
with

657
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
geolocations from

658
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
where tweet was sent

659
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
to then what information is being sent

660
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,159
from

661
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,000
a specific location

662
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,039
and you could kind of start

663
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,799
figuring out like okay well

664
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
where might this be

665
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,240
so you're you're starting to trace

666
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,200
things

667
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,880
and so

668
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,799
like you can do this about yourself you

669
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,039
could see like well what information am

670
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,120
i sending out there

671
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,640
what information like if you're on

672
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,159
twitter what information am i sending

673
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
out there in my tweets

674
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
and then what information is being sent

675
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
out in my house and then

676
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,919
how what what information can be found

677
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,400
out about me so that's kind of like

678
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,760
remember we're taking this this is a

679
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,760
journey um and so

680
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,360
when you think about like what can be

681
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,960
found out about yourself

682
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,480
that's where you want to go with this

683
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
and so we'll take a look at then

684
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,159
um

685
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,840
how we can

686
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,520
make it so that there's a little bit

687
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,120
less

688
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,240
of that

689
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,320
and of course for sending out network

690
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,360
traffic

691
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,240
um you can you can check

692
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
this with what you're sending out from a

693
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
network traffic perspective

694
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,400
and then

695
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,640
make sure that you're using um like a

696
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,600
vpn and then have a firewall

697
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
uh on your network system to then

698
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,919
just add those extra layers there

699
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
because you do want to mask your traffic

700
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,120
a little bit

701
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,080
and not just have it be so traceable

702
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,120
um probably i mean like personally yes

703
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,279
personal preference

704
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
so

705
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,080
we've looked at now

706
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,520
a couple different ones

707
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
um

708
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,200
i'm going to have us look at one more

709
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
tool

710
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,760
and then we're going to talk about

711
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,360
ways to mitigate and then ways to

712
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
practice this as this is of interest to

713
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
you

714
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,640
so if you have kali linux

715
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
you then automatically will have

716
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,399
um

717
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,039
the harvester installed on it as part of

718
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,039
it

719
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,000
so

720
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
i included already

721
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,039
the search

722
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,399
um

723
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,919
that i'm gonna have us do

724
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,640
and this one's not specific to tom hanks

725
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
um

726
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,799
you know

727
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,960
he doesn't have his own website that he

728
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
has um so we're not going to enumerate

729
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,559
a website of his because he doesn't have

730
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,480
his own website so i just kind of

731
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
figured we would just do cali

732
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
um it's kind of like a generalized

733
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
generic one to search and then that way

734
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
you can see like what the results are

735
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,679
but you know maybe you

736
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,679
have your own website

737
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,559
and

738
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,799
it would be beneficial for you

739
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,000
to run this search on your website to

740
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,679
see ah

741
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,159
what information is

742
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,960
being sent back about this like what how

743
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
can you

744
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
as you enumerate it what what

745
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,399
information is being

746
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,960
gathered or can be gathered and um

747
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
so let's take a look at this and let me

748
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,000
walk through

749
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,480
what this line is so the harvester pulls

750
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,200
up

751
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,799
um this tool

752
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,159
um

753
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
and then tech d pulls up the domain tac

754
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
l is a delimiter so this is going to

755
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,399
delimit 300 searches

756
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,159
um tech b says what to search and then

757
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
after this i'll just do the harvester

758
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,679
and we can look at like all the

759
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,039
different options

760
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,120
but first we'll we'll run through an

761
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
actual search result so we can see what

762
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
that looks like

763
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,039
so i'm going to hit enter

764
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,279
you can see it says searching in google

765
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,520
because that's what we set as the search

766
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
and this is the creator too

767
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,720
so she's the creator for this tool

768
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,440
oh

769
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,240
that's interesting

770
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,279
i've run this before

771
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,360
literally was just using this i don't

772
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
know why i would say that there's an

773
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,840
error with the user been because i

774
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,120
didn't change anything on it

775
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
hmm

776
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,760
interesting

777
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
i didn't go into any of my files and

778
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,479
change py files

779
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,760
hmm

780
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,120
i'm just gonna try running it again um

781
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,559
because i literally

782
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,799
didn't change anything in my files

783
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,760
so that's that's very odd

784
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,080
but what we would expect to see is

785
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,200
searching

786
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
xero searching 100 searching 200

787
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,039
searching 300

788
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,760
and then some results uh where we'll get

789
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,039
one email

790
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,399
um that will get

791
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,360
a couple different uh

792
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
interesting

793
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,240
okay

794
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
um

795
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,720
i'm gonna try

796
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,279
just running a

797
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,919
make a difference but let me just

798
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,120
fun

799
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,840
um

800
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,158
i try

801
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
different domain but that should make a

802
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,159
difference

803
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,600
yeah yeah that's not the reason why it's

804
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,519
not working so okay um that's fun

805
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,320
so the power of a live demo

806
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,440
um

807
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,480
okay well imagine that that had worked

808
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,240
and we were able to see some results

809
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,399
what i'm gonna show you next is

810
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,480
some of the options with the harvester

811
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
so you can go through a bunch of

812
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,440
different search engines

813
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
um

814
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
like i said you have got

815
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
tech d for domain attack b for data

816
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,840
source so like i used google for that

817
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,799
one um

818
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,880
and there's quite a few you can use or

819
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,399
you can even use all

820
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,519
um

821
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,600
somebody interesting to use like i could

822
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,120
switch it up and try that but i still

823
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,360
think it's not going to work um

824
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,799
and then

825
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,120
you can do a bunch of different options

826
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,200
so sometimes you might do like show

827
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
options for the harvester you just type

828
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,360
the harvester and that shows you all the

829
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,279
options that you get

830
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,519
so

831
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,720
yeah let's try

832
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
yeah okay so

833
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,000
i'll do

834
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,559
this really fast

835
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,159
so that's why we're getting the issue

836
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
like i didn't see that at the top

837
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,679
so

838
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,839
pycrl is not compiled against open ssl

839
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,760
so this is why we're getting the issue

840
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,119
so the secure socket layer sites

841
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,679
okay so that would take a

842
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,040
potentially a bit to fix with

843
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,480
troubleshooting it could also be a

844
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
really simple fix but i'm not gonna run

845
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,918
into that right now

846
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,760
um

847
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,520
so what we've done

848
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
is

849
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,879
we've

850
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,679
taken a

851
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
look at a variety of different things

852
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
that we can do

853
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,400
from

854
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,640
um

855
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,839
from the ocean framework right

856
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,280
there's so many different things here

857
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
right and i was only just showing you

858
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,640
like social networks

859
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,079
um

860
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,200
and then

861
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,040
um

862
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,119
you can see like so many different

863
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,400
things here

864
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
um

865
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,240
because you could really dig into a lot

866
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
of these different ones the other one i

867
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,880
did want to show is geolocation actually

868
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,079
and then way back imagery because this

869
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,040
could also be a really interesting tool

870
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,839
so we talked already a bit about

871
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,359
geolocation where

872
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,880
you know you could have that information

873
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,119
from from the tweets

874
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,440
you know both the searching from

875
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,359
um and from the twitter page but then

876
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,200
let's say like you actually use a

877
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,680
scraping tool and you get

878
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,920
all of someone's tweets and then you

879
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
want to look back like oh

880
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,599
in

881
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,960
2000

882
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,920
um in 2012 they wrote this i'd actually

883
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,079
like to see what it looked like then and

884
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,440
what that

885
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,960
home was like that they were tweeting

886
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,520
from so you can actually then

887
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,119
look back here

888
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,320
in the way back um and then go to

889
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,680
past years and see what a specific place

890
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
looked like

891
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
um it's like like let's say you wanted

892
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
to look in

893
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
2014 in june

894
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,480
and then you can go to specific places

895
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,960
and then see

896
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,920
the

897
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,040
address

898
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,880
specific place for that

899
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
so that could be an additional layered

900
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,800
search that you're doing as well so you

901
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
have

902
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,880
um

903
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,720
geolocation information you have date

904
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,800
time information and then you can go to

905
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,640
that space and see what it looked like

906
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
so that's like another layered search

907
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,560
that you can do here

908
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,880
from geolocation and way back in the

909
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,920
dream

910
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,230
um

911
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,839
[Music]

912
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,520
so

913
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,440
just reviewing once again our tools we

914
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
did the ocean framework

915
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,440
we looked at ways that we can add in

916
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,599
specificity with our google searching

917
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,520
we looked at chodan

918
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,040
and how we can look up connected devices

919
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,200
as well as um the

920
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
um

921
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,960
protocols that are even being used too

922
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,520
right so like you can see that um we get

923
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,359
some sorting here um with protocols

924
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,440
and even countries so once again that

925
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,400
geo

926
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
part to it

927
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
and we

928
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,240
tried to use harvester which is so

929
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
interesting because it was working

930
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,119
literally earlier today i was just

931
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,280
double checking everything so

932
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,320
um

933
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,280
more to be played with that for later

934
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,720
so

935
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,320
we can see like i said data data data um

936
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,880
there's there's a lot of it um

937
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,680
and

938
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,520
um

939
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,079
you know one of the things

940
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,040
is that

941
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,160
you can remove some of it

942
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,359
but depending on what type of data it is

943
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,400
you won't necessarily be able

944
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
to remove

945
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,480
all of it and this is why like this is

946
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
literally something that was posted

947
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,359
about some of my data um if you ever had

948
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,400
a

949
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
government job and their salary

950
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,400
information about your government job

951
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,160
posted

952
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,480
because you know it was a g-level type

953
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,599
thing

954
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,040
that's not going to be something that

955
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,720
you're going to be able to remove

956
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
because it was public record that you

957
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,680
had that position and made

958
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,119
that and that salary level was

959
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,280
public right um so that will be

960
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,320
something

961
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,800
that you can't remove so this was like a

962
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,760
notice

963
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
on one of the sites when i was looking

964
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,960
at like from trying to remove something

965
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,440
um so that just kind of note that that

966
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
you can't always

967
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,640
remove everything even though you're

968
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,680
like i want to scrub all of my data it's

969
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,839
it's not always possible unfortunately

970
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,720
um but there are ways to scrub bits and

971
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
pieces of it

972
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,280
and so that's what we'll take a look at

973
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,480
um

974
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
so i just i re

975
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,880
inserted this this is from before too

976
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,760
um i found this to be pretty helpful um

977
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
that someone made last year

978
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,280
this is a way that they were working on

979
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
getting rid of a lot of the data that

980
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,119
they found out there about themselves

981
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,440
and they said that they kind of went

982
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
through it and it took

983
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,280
a little bit less than 20 hours but they

984
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,320
did it

985
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,119
over time and they suggested starting

986
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,440
with this compiled list which i've

987
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,200
pulled up here

988
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,119
and just kind of going through a variety

989
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,280
of the places that tend to have your

990
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,319
data

991
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,599
and so

992
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,119
a bunch of these

993
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,119
have just contact us type things and you

994
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,359
literally just request

995
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,680
you know i am this person

996
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,720
you have my data on your site

997
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,960
please remove it

998
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
so that's it's it's a

999
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,359
fairly straightforward process but but

1000
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,280
can be time consuming

1001
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,359
so that that is

1002
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,280
one of the things that you can do to

1003
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
work on scrubbing

1004
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,800
um yourself from these places

1005
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,200
okay

1006
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
now

1007
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,040
probably tell i i think this is pretty

1008
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,079
cool

1009
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,000
and and really interesting i mean

1010
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,359
obviously i have some personal

1011
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,760
connections to it as well

1012
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
but if if you think it's pretty cool if

1013
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,599
you've enjoyed this journey that we've

1014
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,520
been on on

1015
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,319
then there are some ways that you can

1016
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,440
continue

1017
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
working on your ocean knowledge working

1018
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,839
on developing even more

1019
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,880
and so what i would recommend doing is

1020
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,359
getting involved with trace labs and

1021
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,040
they're an amazing organization that

1022
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,119
works on finding missing people they

1023
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,960
have

1024
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,920
osint captured the flags um search

1025
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,640
parties where um they they occur several

1026
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,880
times a year actually quite a few times

1027
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,200
and so i've included their website here

1028
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,119
um you can be a participant as part of

1029
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,119
the search party ctf or you can be a

1030
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,640
judge

1031
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,240
or you could do

1032
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
both on different times during the year

1033
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,839
because they have so many

1034
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,680
and so i definitely

1035
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,760
recommend doing that their most recent

1036
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,440
one was in june and you know it was

1037
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,960
really cool

1038
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,560
and then if this is really fascinating

1039
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,839
to you there's a really great book

1040
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,880
called information hunters so i found it

1041
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,760
fascinated by um kbps um i might not be

1042
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,680
pronouncing her name correctly though

1043
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
so trace labs

1044
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,119
this is their

1045
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,960
website so they actually work on

1046
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,040
crowdsource like us we could do this

1047
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,800
many of you probably have done

1048
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,839
um

1049
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,680
that they work on helping to find

1050
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,040
missing people

1051
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,079
so i kind of this idea of helping others

1052
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,800
becoming part of that solution

1053
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,560
and so that's you know something that i

1054
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,440
think is really really excellent to do

1055
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,680
and and work on that

1056
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,800
um

1057
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
so those are two major ways and the

1058
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
thing is with trace labs as well

1059
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,319
they also have a whole set of resources

1060
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,400
for learning more

1061
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,920
about

1062
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,000
ocean as well so they've cultivated and

1063
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,359
developed

1064
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,720
how can you become better at oceant um

1065
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,640
they basically have like a course um

1066
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
that's all sequence and everything so if

1067
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,800
it's super fascinating to you i can't

1068
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,560
recommend enough

1069
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,160
doing one of their ctfs if you're on a

1070
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,280
team of four

1071
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,119
as well as um then taking their the

1072
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,119
course that they have like i i think

1073
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,520
that that is really excellent to do

1074
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,839
um so we're we're pretty much at the end

1075
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,440
of our journey

1076
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,000

[Music]

1093
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,540

thank you so much megan we do have some

1096
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,560
time so

1097
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,040
i i collected some questions thank you

1098
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,800
so much uh to the audience for

1099
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,119
submitting and uh we can start with

1100
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,920
those so the first one came from jen s

1101
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
and she was wondering about apis for

1102
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,760
this information

1103
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,920
yeah yeah there definitely are um a

1104
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,960
whole slew of apis um that you can use

1105
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,280
for both like setting up data scraping

1106
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
um and just in general using his data

1107
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,280
sets um

1108
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,880
so i don't i don't have any of the top

1109
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,160
of my head but if you want to connect

1110
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,040
with me on slack or linkedin or twitter

1111
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,560
i'm happy to send you um here is

1112
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,680
a um you know toolkit for those two i

1113
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,920
just i would be like setting up like

1114
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,599
here's a url and i just i don't have

1115
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,880
that off the top of my head but yeah

1116
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,280
they're 100 um because you can actually

1117
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,160
write

1118
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,640
code for um doing that web scraping and

1119
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,440
and that's all api based yeah

1120
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,680
thank you um a second question came from

1121
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,079
marissa midler and that was did you ever

1122
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,079
run into any issues with data brokers

1123
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,680
refusing to remove your information

1124
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,480
so

1125
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,200
i have run into the one case i said

1126
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
where like i even include that

1127
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,000
screenshot where it was uh we won't

1128
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,560
remove it so that that has happened and

1129
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,720
then i have run into a couple times

1130
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,520
where

1131
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,560
it's

1132
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,440
it's remote it's refusal by

1133
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,599
like ignoring you in the sense of like

1134
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,720
you just don't hear back you're just

1135
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,280
kind of ghosted so that that has been

1136
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,800
something i've run into and you don't

1137
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,560
really have that much recourse unless

1138
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
you want to try to take legal action

1139
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,880
which i haven't done um

1140
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,839
so there's there's not that much

1141
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,119
that can be done

1142
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,599
for that yeah

1143
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,880
okay

1144
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,720
a third question came from monique

1145
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,160
sherman and they asked which job titles

1146
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,079
would use these skills

1147
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,400
oh that's a great question so um pen

1148
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,280
testers right this is this is the first

1149
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,560
um step often in um a pen test is

1150
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,480
gathering information

1151
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,520
because you are trying to figure out

1152
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,560
what a organization does

1153
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,040
um and how they work um but yeah i do

1154
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
risk assessment like you need to know

1155
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,160
about how an organization works as well

1156
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,440
too so

1157
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,000
um i mean i i really think like anyone

1158
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,839
can use this because um i don't know if

1159
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,839
you went to the talk monique yesterday

1160
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,400
about ocean for job searching um you can

1161
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,599
use it for

1162
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,440
you know being more effective at your

1163
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,200
job searching um so it definitely really

1164
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,240
can be

1165
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,280
many many different types of uh

1166
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,720
jobs that do this like i'm sure we've

1167
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,000
all seen the different memes that are

1168
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,440
like um

1169
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,240
a programmer at year one or zero and

1170
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,720
then they have google up and then

1171
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
you're 10 and then they have google up i

1172
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,960
mean being able to effectively google

1173
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
things and search for things

1174
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,119
is is itself a skill because you have to

1175
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,760
know enough to know what to search it's

1176
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,040
not that you

1177
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,599
know nothing and are using this tool

1178
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,760
it's that you know the right things to

1179
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,400
search and the ways to search

1180
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
i can tell you as a threat intelligence

1181
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,280
specialist that's what we you we use all

1182
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,319
the time yeah analysts right any anyone

1183
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,640
analysts like cti etc um i mean it's i'd

1184
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,040
say it's a pretty pervasive skill

1185
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,960
through out cyber security um like i'm

1186
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,200
sure many people have seen the domains

1187
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,359
of cyber security where it's like the

1188
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,000
the visual with all the circles um and

1189
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,599
we could kind of go through all of those

1190
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,599
and think well grc right like you need

1191
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,280
to know about the laws and being able to

1192
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,319
search those um

1193
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,079
threat intelligence right the ic

1194
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,800
community is huge in that um

1195
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,960
if you're in devsteck ops you need to be

1196
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,079
able to

1197
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,240
figure out information about um your

1198
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,960
secure coding so yeah it's

1199
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
everywhere

1200
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,839

helped because it looked like it was

1224
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
probably just a broken thing but it's so

1225

funny it had been working before so

1226
