talks in this speaker track uh from uh

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,480
specifically focused on uh

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,399
the skills and experiences that women

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,920
can provide to the technology in the

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
cyber security track

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
and today

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,719
um video mercy is going to expand upon

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,039
that with her unique experiences

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,719
and uh

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,319
specifically uh vidya uh studied biology

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
and accounting in uh college that's how

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
she got her start and then uh based on

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,439
connections uh and the nice people in

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,280
the field started a job in security

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,520
consulting um

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,680
and then eventually expanded and uh

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
evolved into the cyber security field

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,840
over the years uh she completed her uh

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
mba uh from wharton and then has

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
recently started a uh or joined a

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
startup focused on solving healthcare

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
cybersecurity and uh pro active

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,360
device-based solutions uh she's the

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,600
third employee in that uh

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
in that uh

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
that has joined uh the first

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
non-technical hierarchy she has a lot of

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,840
uh detailed experience in this uh

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
particular topic uh quick administrative

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600

thanks sean uh appreciate the

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
introduction hello everyone thank you

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,879
for choosing to spend a moment with me

59
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
this morning um as mentioned i am going

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
to be talking about why non-technicals

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
matter um first as someone who is

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
historically sponsored conferences i

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
really want to take a moment to thank

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
the folks that are sponsoring this

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,879
because it does take a lot to make this

66
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,760
uh

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
whole thing operate and make the

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,280
conference come to life so thanks to the

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
sponsors as well as to the generous

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
volunteers for their time and effort

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,879
so

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,360
why non-technicals matter

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
so i remember the very first defcon i

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
attended i was sitting in a tight

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
conference room it was sweaty i'd been

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,319
there for a long time and there was a

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
group of really prestigious folks up on

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
stage and someone raised their hand and

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,120
said hey i'm not technical i've never

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
done coding in my life how do i break

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
into cyber security and this speaker

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
whom i'd come to respect throughout the

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
recession without missing a beat said

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,239
you got to learn to code you got to do

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
the time put in the hard work learn to

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
speak the language of the developers

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,159
that's how you show value

88
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,480
and as a non-technical person my heart

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
just broke i had no intentions of

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
learning how to code i didn't have the

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,840
resources available to do that and it

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
wasn't where my passion lied

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,519
and i've often felt in that moment was

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,159
no exception that being non-technical

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
has meant that i didn't belong in cyber

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,360
security

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
and advice like learn to code didn't

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,280
crop up just that once it kept showing

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,519
up as thematically this is how you break

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
into cyber security

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
and i know it's not malicious and i

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,680
don't blame anyone including myself but

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
by learning to articulate my value it's

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
helped me get a seat at the table

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
and really prove value to my

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,799
organization

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,159
and that is what i'd like to share with

108
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
you all today as mentioned my name is

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
vidya morthy i'm the chief operating

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
officer at a cyber security startup that

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,320
focuses on medical device security

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,238
so one of the things that i'd like to

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,358
start with is the common perception of

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
what cyber security is i think in media

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
we often see it depicted as someone

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
wearing a hoodie with multiple monitors

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,639
coding in the dark and really kind of

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
being this highly technical resource and

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
to an outsider that doesn't have

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
experience in cyber security they might

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
actually think that that is what cyber

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
security is and it's not very appealing

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
if that's not your skill set

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,040
but according to a study by forest and

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
sullivan 30 percent of all cyber

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
security roles are actually not

127
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
technical and according to isc squared

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
there's a cyber security gap in terms of

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
resources that's evolving to the tune of

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
about four million people worldwide

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
thirty percent of four million people is

132
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
a lot of non-technical jobs

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
and so the question becomes what do

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,840
these non-technical roles actually

135
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,120
entail there's a whole bunch of things

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,919
and it ranges from governance risk

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
compliance to project management

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,120
analytics learning data sciences

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
technical writing there are so many

140
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
functions that fit across an

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,560
organization

142
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
that don't require some level of coding

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
and it can be even privacy regulation

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
and learning law as we've seen kind of

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
in the last four to ten years the notion

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
of privacy has really become front and

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
center i think that that's a big place

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,919
for non-technical folks to to play

149
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,000
so the follow-up question to that is how

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
do these roles actually fit in the

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,120
organization are they people that are

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,280
revered are they positions that i would

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
aspire to grow within and it'll become

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
more than just an entry-level role and i

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,160
think the answer is absolutely

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
people have been fighting about where

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
does security fit an organization since

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,520
the concept of security became

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
acceptable in corporate culture so i

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
think the relevance that we as

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
non-technicals can bring to the party is

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,639
that security spans all functions it

163
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
doesn't matter what your org chart looks

164
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,560
like or where you're placed in an entity

165
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
when security can be positioned as being

166
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,199
a business enabler that's where you

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
belong and that's where you're going to

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
take root successfully

169
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
now it's a common trope in cyber

170
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,000
security for people to say that

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
people are the weakest link and i think

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
this is an important note when we talk

173
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
about non-technical

174
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
value sometimes they often say hey

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
people are the weakest link up to 40 of

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
data breaches are caused by people and i

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
think where non-technicals can thrive is

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
by saying well is it really that the

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
people are our failures or are we not

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
designing for our people maybe we're

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,319
missing 40 of these human use cases and

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,400
we don't understand how people use our

183
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
systems

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
in the early days of computing

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
this was probably true right we didn't

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,759
have a lot of knowledge about how to

187
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
design products securely or how to make

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,160
environments secure

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,479
but since then we've kind of grown as a

190
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,319
community there are well-established

191
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
frameworks and lots of advice out there

192
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,840
for how to protect people and their

193
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,240
devices and as defenders

194
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
we really want to be able to show that

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
what we are doing results in value to

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
our teams

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
but a lot of times the defenders can

198
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
sometimes feel like they're on the

199
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
losing team and that can often have to

200
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,919
do with missing potential threats or

201
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,599
missing vulnerabilities that are

202
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
applicable

203
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
so i'd like to do a simple exercise

204
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,240
there's a lot of examples of homogeneity

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
versus diverse teams in various parts of

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,479
business

207
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,039
one example which many famously know is

208
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
in 2014

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
apple launched what they called a

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
comprehensive health tracker this health

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,199
tracker allowed for tracking of exercise

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,160
what you ate and even things as random

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
as copper intake

214
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
and despite including these niche things

215
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
like copper intake apple failed to

216
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,960
include something that would have

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,599
probably been useful to about half of

218
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,520
their user population

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
period tracking

220
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,199
now one asks themselves how is that

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,240
possible

222
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
and i've come to the conclusion that

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
it's most probable that they had a team

224
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
that was homogeneous they lacked the

225
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
diversity to know what needed to be

226
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
included in their design

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,879
and i think if we carry this analogy

228
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
over to cyber security we can think

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,279
about what is our security objective and

230
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,599
are we perhaps missing it when we don't

231
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,159
have a diverse team

232
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,360
so let's take the example of trying to

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
design a device that's going to operate

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
in a hospital for 10 to 15 years

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
and we want to be able to know when a

236
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
known vulnerability comes up that

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
applies to that device

238
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
so this would be something like openssl

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,760
is now on version 4.1.1 and what the

240
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
version is on the device is a couple

241
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
iterations back and there's known

242
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
vulnerability getting exploited in the

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
wild

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
so imagine we have a homogeneous team

245
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,760
that's all technical resources and they

246
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,959
don't uh

247
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,480
they try to come up with a solution to

248
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
this problem

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
one can imagine that they go something

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
like this they come up with a database

251
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
on how to track all the components in a

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
device

253
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,399
and then they figure out how to match

254
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
those components with vulnerabilities as

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
they come up and then they decide to

256
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
take action once they've identified a

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,040
match

258
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
and in isolation that sounds like a

259
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
pretty good approach you could certainly

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
solve a lot of problems with that

261
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
strategy

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
but think of what a diverse team could

263
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
think about

264
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
now the context of this if you caught it

265
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
in the beginning was a medical device

266
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
operating in a hospital

267
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,959
when you have a device attached to a

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
patient the core thing that a lot of

269
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
folks may think about is what is the

270
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,959
patient safety impact of this device

271
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,200
so imagine we have a vulnerability and

272
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
this component on a device is in fact

273
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,760
impacted while this more diverse team is

274
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
perhaps thinking about well what happens

275
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
to this device in the field can the

276
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
patient still be treated can we still

277
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,800
provide clinical care to this person is

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
it enough of a patient safety risk that

279
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
we should go down the path of fixing

280
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
this vulnerability or do we

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,959
contextualize this vulnerability from a

282
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
technical perspective

283
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
into the use case of how the device

284
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,880
actually operates

285
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
i as someone in the healthcare field

286
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
strongly feel that it is far more

287
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
important to really know the context of

288
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
where this device is operating and

289
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
understand yes there is a patient at the

290
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
end of this

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
and it's no fault of the homogeneous

292
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,279
team that they perhaps didn't include

293
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
that but it's to the point of there is

294
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
value when you have a diverse

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,920
perspective and think about how to solve

296
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,519
this

297
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
so you may be asking yourself hey this

298
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
is all great in theory but what about

299
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,279
real life

300
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
any given week you've seen the headlines

301
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,920
in the papers and you know that there

302
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
are vulnerabilities that are being

303
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
exploited on an ongoing basis

304
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,040
we've had a solid 20 to 25 years to try

305
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,360
to build our defenses as attackers have

306
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
become more mature

307
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
and what we're doing so far

308
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
doesn't seem to be cutting it

309
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,399
so i think that demonstrates that the

310
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
model to date perhaps has some flaws to

311
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,519
it and we really need to expand how we

312
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
think about defending our important

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
resources

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,880
so examples i can offer in real life

315
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,720
as i mentioned i'm in healthcare and

316
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
when i looked at the top 40 medical

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
device manufacturers out there i did a

318
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,920
look to say okay who is in charge of

319
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
product security and what is their

320
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,720
background and i can say from my rough

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
study that three out of every 10 device

322
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,600
manufacturers

323
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,800
uh don't have a technical background

324
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,279
really leading this effort so how can a

325
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
non-technical person be in charge of

326
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
product security because there's value

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,959
that we're bringing to the table and

328
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
we're able to demonstrate that

329
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,760
and while i love a good anecdote i think

330
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
there might be something to studies as

331
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
well so i try to find some additional

332
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,560
data

333
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,959
deloitte did a study back in 2017 and i

334
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
really love this study for no other

335
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
reason than it says that they're looking

336
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,200
at the diversity of cyber security but

337
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,360
it wasn't about diversity how we may

338
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
often think of it it was about the

339
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
changing faces of diversity and the fact

340
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
that you need different roles to really

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
be successful

342
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
so what this study showed is there there

343
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,680
are several trends in place and two that

344
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
i wanted to highlight is that job

345
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
descriptions are moving away from kind

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
of these multi-page really technical

347
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
requirements and becoming what they

348
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
called esoteric and when i looked into

349
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
that it was really just kind of this

350
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,680
abstracted way of thinking about a

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
problem how do you problem-solve how do

352
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
you approach a situation

353
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
they also identified a growing emphasis

354
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,320
on the need for expertise in privacy and

355
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
security and so it showed that there was

356
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
this trend towards non-technical

357
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
requirements that we really needed to

358
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
show and be able to demonstrate to show

359
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,279
what value

360
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
and i think the fact that these

361
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,560
headlines are coming up more and more

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
prevalently

363
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,079
mean that kind of the folks that are

364
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
more on main street understand what

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
cyber security is and that percolates

366
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
into operations so you now have folks

367
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
from the board that understand cyber

368
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,959
security you have leaders from the

369
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,720
management teams that understand cyber

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
security it goes across and people start

371
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,680
to understand that

372
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
there's more than just a traditional

373
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
background to really find your path

374
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
forward

375
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
so let's recap quickly we agree that

376
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,199
cyber security is more than coding and

377
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
that it requires a variety of skill sets

378
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,120
to really be successful and we've

379
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
examined the fact that there are groups

380
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
of same thinkers that can potentially

381
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,959
come up with a less than successful and

382
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,920
robust strategy for securing something

383
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
and we've seen that hiring practices are

384
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
starting to evolve and they're changing

385
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,519
how they're asking for job descriptions

386
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,040
and looking for candidates to help

387
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,079
support

388
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
so what's left

389
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
prioritizing our non-security or

390
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,360
non-technical voices

391
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,199
one of the most impactful skills that

392
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,279
has worked in my life is the ability to

393
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,000
translate cybersecurity risks into

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
business risks

395
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
now i'm not talking about fud or crying

396
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
wolf or saying that the sky is falling

397
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,199
all the time i'm talking about a

398
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,920
methodical and intentional way to really

399
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
express the impact of cyber security on

400
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
business

401
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
so what does that entail

402
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,800
there are lots of theories out there but

403
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
one of the ones that's been very common

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,480
and well received by folks is this

405
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
notion of risk-based cybersecurity and

406
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
what that means is being able to

407
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
correlate kind of where we prioritize

408
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,760
cybersecurity with risks to the business

409
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,480
now

410
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
how does this work in a non-technical

411
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
person's role well it can begin by

412
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
connecting a cybersecurity practitioner

413
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
with someone in the business and saying

414
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,160
hey help me understand what you perceive

415
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
as value and define as valuable to your

416
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
organization

417
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
and it can be connecting folks it can be

418
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
identifying what is important it can be

419
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,079
saying who are the people that are

420
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
participating in this what are the

421
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
systems that are supporting this

422
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
and there are studies to support that

423
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,639
even just

424
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,880
knowing what your priorities should be

425
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
and reallocating your order of

426
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
operations can prove more successful

427
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
with no additional budgetary spend in

428
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
one instance they found just

429
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,320
reprioritizing existing action items

430
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
made them seven and a half times more

431
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,600
secure across their enterprise

432
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,480
mckinsey offers a an eight step advice

433
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
about how to go about building this and

434
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
i thought we'd just take this down and

435
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,839
kind of break it down into what could be

436
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
valuable so i went by business function

437
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
and buy kind of main areas that are

438
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
non-technical to really see what could

439
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
this include and so i won't i won't go

440
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,480
box by box but what i do want to

441
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
demonstrate is that if the cyber

442
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
security team really connects with the

443
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,720
different functions

444
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
take a look at what that value could

445
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,600
entail and what you could be focusing on

446
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,800
someone's that

447
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,440
i think are motivational is when we can

448
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
really show that what we are trying to

449
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,320
advocate for directly impacts the

450
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,279
business

451
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,680
and if that direct impact really changes

452
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,399
how the company operates or prioritizes

453
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,959
their behavior that's what sustains it

454
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,519
you want security to no longer be us

455
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
talking about people being the weakest

456
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,399
link if an entire system can be brought

457
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
down by a person clicking a phishing

458
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,600
email

459
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
is it really on that person if an aiml

460
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
trained email filter didn't catch it

461
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,759
either i think the answer is no i think

462
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
it means that we haven't designed it for

463
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,639
the user

464
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,600
so i leave with this notion of what

465
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,079
skills can we demonstrate to make

466
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,519
ourselves valuable within the

467
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,800
organization

468
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
and it's not about just being able to or

469
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,199
willing to work really hard i think it's

470
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,680
about the ability to work smarter and so

471
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,360
that means having a methodology and

472
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
rigorously planning what it is you

473
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,039
really want to demonstrate with a

474
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,199
logical and analytical approach towards

475
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,160
the problem

476
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,599
and some of the things i think we forget

477
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
in cyber security are that we have to

478
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,039
have soft skills

479
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
if the folks that we're talking to and

480
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,359
selling security to don't understand

481
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
what we're talking about they're never

482
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
going to advocate for continuing the

483
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,199
program or enhancing our spend for

484
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
budget

485
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
excellent presenters and having strong

486
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
communication skills can go a long way

487
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,640
with advocating cyber security

488
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
management skills are another great one

489
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
what we see with project management is

490
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,400
that if we are able to embed cyber

491
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
security requirements into a traditional

492
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
product development lifecycle then you

493
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
can say hey this is just part of that

494
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
natural gate and everyone takes security

495
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,440
as part of that development framework

496
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,039
and it becomes kind of

497
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,080
the base of how we build stuff

498
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,919
strategic business acumen is something

499
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
that i think is really important um more

500
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
and more cyber security is evolving from

501
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
a technical discipline as we mentioned

502
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,160
to a strategic business one being able

503
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,039
to

504
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,880
succeed in

505
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
compelling c-suite

506
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
colleagues to really understand what

507
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,120
we're doing can really go a long way to

508
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
positioning cyber security as an

509
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,360
organization-wide priority

510
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
and i think one of the things that a

511
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,120
good practitioner thrives on is the

512
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,919
ability to pursue solving a problem

513
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,520
being persistent having that grit and

514
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
going after new and novel

515
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
challenges is something that we all need

516
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
to

517
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
try to strive towards

518
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
one of the things i think is a way to

519
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
demonstrate value is keeping track of

520
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
kind of new innovation so paying close

521
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
attention to developments in the

522
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
industry whether that's things like

523
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,480
regulatory uh like privacy regulations

524
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
i'm based in california there's a new

525
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,880
california consumer privacy act or gdpr

526
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
for our european colleagues

527
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
understanding technologies that are

528
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
coming about knowing what new threats

529
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,000
are evolving and being proactive and

530
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,720
thinking about hey how do we shift as

531
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
the industry continues to shift i think

532
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,320
this is one of those great things about

533
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,559
cyber security it's never stagnant as

534
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,640
demonstrated by this growing gap of me

535
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
that we have to to really become better

536
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
defenders

537
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,559
learning the language now i want to be

538
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,640
clear this is not learning to code this

539
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
is merely learning to understand the

540
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
folks on your technical teams that you

541
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,039
will need to be working with and there's

542
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,799
this great post i'll share the link as

543
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
well where they break down software so

544
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,200
it's like food and you can understand

545
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
kind of how folks go about building the

546
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
basic blocks of what would otherwise be

547
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
a very technical jargon so having a

548
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
basic understanding of the language can

549
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
prove to be very helpful

550
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
and the last thing i'd say is we have to

551
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
as a collective think beyond the

552
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,240
assumptions we have of attackers

553
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
imagine often when you download a new

554
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
app and it takes you through where you

555
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
should be clicking and how to order

556
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
something that you're trying to get

557
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
more often than not sometimes we say hey

558
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
why is this button here that really

559
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
isn't how we should think about

560
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,679
designing this

561
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,200
that same notion exists in cyber

562
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320
security hey i'm trying to defend my box

563
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
i've put my security in such a way that

564
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,080
i think makes sense to me but are we

565
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,919
really checking our assumptions and

566
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
saying hey an attacker doesn't have to

567
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
follow the protocols of how to

568
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
authenticate to this device we just need

569
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
to be able to defend it

570
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,559
and so what i would what i would finish

571
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
with is um

572
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,960
this notion of bringing more folks into

573
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,360
the industry and really starting to

574
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,159
demonstrate what your superpower is so

575
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,480
take the time do some inventory on what

576
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
your skills are where your interests lie

577
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,039
as a non-technical person and think

578
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,200
about adding that into your organization

579
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
take a look around and see what

580
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
opportunities exist where is there

581
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,559
something that isn't going quite right

582
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
where there's failure there's often

583
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,480
opportunity to really change how that

584
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
pursues

585
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,159
i'd also encourage thinking about

586
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,919
networking with folks diana initiative

587
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
is a phenomenal event and a weekend for

588
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
you to connect with individuals that are

589
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,440
in this space and have a lot of

590
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
learnings to do

591
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,799
join on twitter be on linkedin get

592
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,320
involved with the conversation and

593
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
you'll find i i'm constantly stupefied

594
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
by how much brilliance is just laid out

595
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,440
on twitter for anyone for the taking

596
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
and i guess i'd leave with these parting

597
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
words of

598
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,799
your value is not defined by the

599
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
criteria on some job description your

600
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,440
value is going to be where your passion

601
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
and your ability to show

602
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
care for your organization really

603
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,559
correlate and i encourage you all to to

604
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,880
continue in the field we need we need

605
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
the help we need the diversity and we

606
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
can only be stronger together

607
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
thank you for the time i think there's a

608
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
couple of questions that i saw pop up so

609
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
let me uh

610
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,520
let me go through those

611
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
i love the the imposter i i hear you

612
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
you're not an imposter you deserve to be

613
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
here it is important

614
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,520
how can we develop uh here's one from

615
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,799
run traditional computer science

616
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,720
programs don't cover in a person's

617
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,960
interpersonal skills how can they be

618
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
developed for those who take a

619
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
traditional technical route i love that

620
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
question because it can sometimes be at

621
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
odds with how um

622
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
with how you how you've come to think

623
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
about traditional problems um one of the

624
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
things i found super helpful is going to

625
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,120
something like a toastmasters so

626
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
toastmasters is a

627
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,480
regular practice where folks get

628
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
together and they practice just standing

629
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
up and doing public speaking and it can

630
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
be about what you're passionate about it

631
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,039
can be about what you have for breakfast

632
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,280
it really runs the gamut and it gives

633
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
you the opportunity to just

634
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,039
practice kind of getting yourself up and

635
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,360
in an uncomfortable position and kind of

636
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
just talking for some prolonged period

637
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,400
of time so

638
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
i would encourage looking into an

639
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
organization like that and if there

640
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
isn't one in your local neighborhood

641
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
think about starting one in your company

642
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,600
because

643
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
it kind of doesn't matter what your

644
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
background is public speaking is not

645
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,600
always comfortable for really anyone so

646
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
that there's always going to be a group

647
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,640
that that's trying to work on that i

648
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
love that as a question

649
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
how do techies learn the language of

650
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
business do you recommend taking

651
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,400
business classes are there other ways

652
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,640
outside of the classroom

653
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,039
um i think the idea to be able to

654
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
translate into business is uh

655
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,039
that's a it's a great question i think

656
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,280
there are some simple tutorials out

657
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,039
there that kind of talk about functions

658
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,200
but honestly i think that the fastest

659
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
route is find a friend in the

660
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,520
organization or the function that you're

661
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,679
participating or supporting and say hey

662
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,840
tell me how you think about risks what

663
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
makes you most nervous so imagine a

664
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,039
person who's in charge of the

665
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,600
production of on a supply chain line

666
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
right they're the ones who are

667
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,360
responsible for actually getting the

668
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
inventory out say hey what's what's the

669
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,960
thing that keeps you up at night how do

670
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,200
you how do you worry about what your

671
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,279
operations are and what you need to do

672
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,960
and then as you kind of uncover that

673
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,480
dialogue i think you'll you'll realize

674
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,880
that i think the the notion of

675
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
understanding all of business and all

676
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,039
the risks is a lot so pick kind of those

677
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,360
specific places where you're operating

678
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
to start with and then see what

679
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,559
interests you and kind of pursue that

680
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,039
would be my suggestion

681
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
uh next one sarah as a non-technical

682
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
contributor oh am i out of town i see

683
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
you

684
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,640
uh go ahead and uh finish a couple more

685
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
questions i believe we have it till the

686
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
half hour okay cool as a non-technical

687
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
contributor how can i show my value to

688
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,880
technical people um really learn learn

689
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
what it is that drives their value so if

690
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
you're talking to a business line that's

691
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
in charge of making infusion pumps for a

692
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,240
medical device manufacturer figure out

693
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,559
what they're most nervous about is it a

694
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,480
pump falling off the back of a truck is

695
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,960
it that a pump doesn't fit in

696
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,360
the hospital try to get a sense of what

697
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,440
it is that they're stressed about from

698
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,360
like a marketing or revenue bottom line

699
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,679
perspective and then c start with kind

700
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,520
of the the system people process that

701
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,960
support that and see where there's

702
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
potentially uh

703
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,159
something that you could focus on and

704
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,880
add value there

705
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,559
um where will i post the link to the

706
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,480

713
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840

the group

718
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
no only that um

719
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
it's common to feel like we have

720
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
imposter syndrome and get really jived

721
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,559
up over this couple of days that we're

722
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,640

people that are going to support you and

725
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,200
i think if you

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,039
show your vulnerability to folks they

727
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,960
will be more supportive and always there

728
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
