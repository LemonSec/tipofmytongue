this is rebecca hoffarts computer

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,800
science teacher from the us virgin

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
islands we're super excited to have her

19

excited to be here this is my favorite

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
organization and i'm ridiculously proud

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,000
to be involved in this today this is

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
going to be a little different kind of

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
presentation i'm not the technical

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,799
wizard in cyber security but

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
i do really feel that we just can't have

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,040
this next generation fight as hard as

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
all of you all did to get into this

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
pathway

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
and i know that when we reach out and

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
help others it builds our self-esteem

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
and helps us make

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
makes us feel good so i'm hoping to give

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
you some inspiration on ways you can

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
reach out give back and boast your own

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
self-esteem along with that and with

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
that i'm going to go ahead and share my

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,960
screen and start to give you a little

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,920
bit of the background in context for

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,600
this talk bear with me

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,399

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,920
so uh yes my name is rebecca hoffert and

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,480
i live in work in the u.s virgin islands

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
i'm going to give you a bit of context

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,760
about uh what i do after i explain why

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,239
i'm here and why you are here

54
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,120
i checked the diana initiatives website

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,319
and i found a friend i'm sorry rebecca

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,560
i we were almost flawless going through

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
this but i think that was my fault um

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
can you reshare please sure no i believe

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
that was me because i thought for a

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,319
minute you guys could not hear me

61
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,640
i think that's my bad let's see here

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,200
okay i'll try to be more patient this

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
time can you hear me still and see the

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
slides

65
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
meg yes you're good to go

66
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,200
great

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,640
so i'm rebecca hawford and i am here to

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,120
talk about being an inspiration to the

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
next generation

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,440
i found a phrase on the diana initiative

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
website which inspired me

72
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,920
and it really

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
spoke to exactly what it is that i want

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,799
to do i don't think anyone would be here

75
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
if they didn't support

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,959
this statement we want to elevate

77
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,159
inspire and support all underrepresented

78
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
genders sexualities races and cultures

79
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,239
in information security i know the title

80
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,040
of my presentation is specific to girls

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,319
but inclusivity is part of what

82
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,439
i do and i'm sure you all

83
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,920
value inclusivity as well let me tell

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,319
you uh the environment that i live and

85
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,120
work in i am not originally from the

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
island of st thomas but i have lived

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
there since the year 2000 it's the

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
longest i've ever lived anywhere in my

89
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,800
life

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
um we're in the caribbean i always tell

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
people we're that little tiny pencil

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
point to the right of puerto rico so

93
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,479
yeah that's us right there to the right

94
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,520
of puerto rico we are a u.s territory

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
under the u.s flag and it is an

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
incredibly terribly beautiful place most

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
people uh when they think of this

98
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
concept of beautiful st thomas think of

99
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
something that looks rather like this

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
of course you've seen this meme and you

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
know that the reality is

102
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
oh yeah it actually does look just like

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
that that's a real picture and if you go

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
there that's basically what it does look

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,199
like

106
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
it's a fantastic place um but it's a

107
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
very small place we're a tiny rock in

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,280
the middle of the ocean in between the

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
caribbean

110
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
and the atlantic roughly 32 square miles

111
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,199
it's about three miles north and south

112
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
and 12 miles east of west um those great

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
views we get are because we're rather

114
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,479
mountainous and you may have heard on

115
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,520
the news back in 2017 we got hit with

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,800
twin category five hurricanes irma and

117
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
maria or auntie or maria as we call them

118
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
so we are very much still

119
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,400
rebuilding from that it has been slow

120
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
slow slow

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
we have a population of roughly 50 000

122
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
on that 32 square mile rock at least

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
according to the 2010 census we think

124
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,600
it's pretty much the same pretty stable

125
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
in terms of overall numbers

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,639
it's interesting because pre-covered we

127
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,240
would have cruise ships that would come

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
in every day and the population of

129
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
cruise ship visitors would outstrip that

130
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
of our local population we had almost 2

131
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,440
million every year on average so more

132
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,319
visitors than locals

133
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,039
our population is diverse and always has

134
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,440
been the us virgin islands has always

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,520
been the crossroads of the caribbean

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
even back in pirate times highly diverse

137
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,560
people from every corner of the world

138
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,039
but we roughly fall into about 75 76

139
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,759
black 15 percent white the rest is very

140
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,720
mixed and about 17 percent of us

141
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
identify as hispanic

142
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
despite our natural beauty we have

143
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
issues with poverty a high percentage of

144
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
our population on our island falls below

145
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
the poverty line especially in our

146
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
younger people people under 18

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
it's a 37 percent live in households

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,319
below poverty

149
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
almost all of those are households uh

150
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
headed by single moms

151
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
because of the hurricanes students had

152
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,599
half day schedules for most of that

153
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,560
school year when the storms hit and

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,039
because of covid we've had school

155
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,440
closures we've had half schedules we've

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
had online school with our unreliable

157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
power and internet connections on our

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
island

159
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
since march of 2020 when our school shut

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,880
down so

161
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,319
the current graduating class of 2021

162
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
barely went to high school they were

163
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
home or doing whatever they were doing

164
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
not at school

165
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
a very high percentage of the time so

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
that is indeed a challenge that our

167
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
graduating class faces

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
it's not all bad we have rich cultural

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
traditions we have our st thomas

170
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,240
carnival we have amazing things that go

171
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
on in our schools like this picture up

172
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,440
here at the top rightish

173
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
is a student troop from an elementary

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
school and that what they do is they go

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,160
to various events and do bamboola dance

176
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
and they talk about the history of the

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
dance and they go all over the place

178
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
it's

179
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
incredibly enriching to be at some of

180
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
our local events we have fantastic food

181
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
some of my favorites are the johnny cake

182
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,800
and of course the franco's don't go

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,039
anywhere but rudy's it's the best

184
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,680
fantastic music and we honor our history

185
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,639
the 1892 commemoration that we do every

186
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
year is a commemoration of coal strike

187
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
workers who are striking for

188
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
higher wages so we do have a bit of a

189
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,280
feisty spirit in the virgin islands uh

190
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
we're proud of that as well we have a

191
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,960
fantastic hbcu the university of the

192
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
virgin islands has brought a lot of

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
wonderful programs to us and it has

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,839
enabled a lot of our young virgin

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,159
islanders to get a college degree that

196
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
otherwise they could never afford

197
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
we are rapidly approaching um

198
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,279
progress

199
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,000
in fact this year and i was traveling i

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,880
did not make it there um but this past

201
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,080
july 10th we had our first ever gay

202
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
pride parade on the island of st thomas

203
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
and it was our own little version um it

204
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
was kicked off with speeches by the

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
rabbi and the minister

206
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,160
that's our downtown area right there

207
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,680
interestingly uh as our values are

208
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,399
changing and moving forward we are also

209
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
changing in technology if you go to

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
submarine cablemap.com or one of the

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,480
other similar sites you'll find that our

212
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,080
us virgin islands is the crux of

213
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,440
one of the biggest just

214
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,680
confluences of underwater internet

215
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
cables on the planet we just have far

216
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,200
more than our share for a 32 square mile

217
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
island and we have had companies come to

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
take advantages of our tax breaks

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,959
programs that we offer if we can ever

220
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,440
find a way to really suck off that

221
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
availability of bandwidth potential and

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
get that out to our youth community

223
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,040
we may be changing the world right in

224
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
front of everything covet is also

225
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
changing our population because

226
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,839
it is possible to get decent at least

227
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
internet connectivity on our island many

228
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,440
people stateside uh during kovid decided

229
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,279
that they wanted to be close to that

230
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,040
natural beauty and come down to us and

231
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,000
that has

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
changed the um the figures on the

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,079
diversity of our population most of

234
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,519
those coming down to the island were

235
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,920
white people and we definitely noticed

236
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,160
that um there's a difference in who's

237
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,480
around these last this last year and a

238
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,079
half

239
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
i am sure that in your communities

240
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
similar changes are happening i wonder

241
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
if kate can maybe help us out because i

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
for whatever reason can't see your your

243
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,399
chat contributions right now but if

244
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,079
there are changes that are influencing

245
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,399
your communities that you could share in

246
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,560
the chat that would be greatly

247
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
appreciated i'm sure we would all be

248
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
interesting and knowing what is going on

249
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
for us it's changes in technology

250
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,240
changes in the diversity the population

251
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
changes value system

252
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,680
and recovering from these two disasters

253
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,479
the hurricanes and also the covet

254
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
and maybe kate if we get some

255
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
submissions there we can just pop in and

256
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,439
talk about those

257
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,279
as far as my personal and professional

258
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
context

259
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,160
not so long ago i was a school librarian

260
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
yes a bit techy but mostly helping kids

261
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,240
enjoy reading i love reading stories to

262
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,399
children and our hbcu uvi uh was awarded

263
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,160
a five-year

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
over a million dollar grant

265
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,079
to and build the k-12 pipeline into

266
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,680
cyber security

267
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,200
i got the benefit to attend a cyber camp

268
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
back in 2014 mostly it was students

269
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
there were a couple of his teachers and

270
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
i just got very excited by the whole

271
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,639
idea of introducing my students to the

272
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
cyber security career path i started

273
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,440
coaching cyberpatriot the next year

274
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,079
and i got the chance to be a leader as

275
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,320
part of the 2015

276
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
cyber camp the following summer

277
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
here you can see our campers in that

278
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
2015 cyber camp that's on the uvi campus

279
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
here in st thomas and they are

280
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
they're just wonderful wonderful bunch

281
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,519
of kids there they're ranging in age

282
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,320
from entering sixth grade to some

283
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
graduating seniors one of the students

284
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
here matthew he's over on the the right

285
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,839
of your screen by me

286
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,920
he's graduated and you're going to see

287
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,079
him in some future pictures in fact a

288
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
lot of these kids you will see in other

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
pictures but what you won't see is a

290
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
predomination of female campers you got

291
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
mostly boys and five female campers in

292
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
that picture

293
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,839
so i wasn't satisfied with that and i

294
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,760
got together with some people that i

295
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
knew from my school and

296
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
worked with the partnerships that we had

297
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
made through that grant program we put

298
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
together a little cyber saturday's

299
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,120
program

300
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,760
through the local ywca that turned out

301
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
to be one of the best things that we

302
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,800
ever did the

303
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,160
people who are in charge of the ywca

304
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
are open to

305
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
an incredibly inclusive program you

306
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,600
don't have to be christian you don't

307
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,519
have to be a girl you don't have to be

308
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,279
anything to be a part of the ywca in st

309
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,839
thomas so we threw up a little website

310
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,200
and we

311
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
were able to get access to a public

312
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
computer center which was hosted by

313
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
the saint andrews episcopal church but

314
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,519
really that initiative comes through the

315
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,839
virgin islands next generation network

316
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
they're a quasi-public corporation that

317
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,360
um

318
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,560
through their

319
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
economic receipts by selling bandwidth

320
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
and through some grant money they are

321
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
able to kind of provide a middle mile

322
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,760
in our

323
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
local network infrastructure

324
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
so we had about 12 computers maybe about

325
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,680
eight of them could connect to the

326
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
internet at any time but we got a great

327
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,480
group together and we even got some

328
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,079
donor sponsorship people started

329
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,920
dropping by and donating new computers

330
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
to us it was a really exciting time and

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,399
we just it was a nice beginning to see

332
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,440
what we could do

333
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
it was wonderful that we were able to

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,720
bring together vi ngn the secor

335
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
partnership out of university of the

336
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
virgin islands which brought in all the

337
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,560
federal grant people department of

338
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
energy and a network of hbcus along with

339
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
the ywca and along with the church

340
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
probably the most important uh we

341
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,959
brought the church ladies and these two

342
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,240
women just organized everything

343
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
as far as being an instructor my life

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
was so easy because i didn't have to

345
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
deal with any supervision and they

346
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
always brought snacks

347
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,720
that was very different from my usual

348
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,839
experience in the classroom so for me it

349
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,680
was a way to learn that the more

350
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
partnerships you can bring into your

351
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,199
movements

352
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,639
the better off it's going to be because

353
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,079
everybody brings a little something to

354
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
the table it's like a potluck dinner if

355
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
you only have to bring the baked beans

356
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
and that's all

357
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,120
makes your life so much easier and it

358
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
makes it a lot easier for more people to

359
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,519
hop in and participate

360
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,360
lesson learned

361
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,600
not only did they bring snacks but they

362
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
brought me a whole fair they decided

363
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
they wanted to organize uh girls in ict

364
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
fair so we partnered up with girls in

365
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
ict which is an organization that's now

366
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
supported by the un women

367
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
and they

368
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
organized a whole fair for the students

369
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
at my school and it was called girls in

370
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
ict but you can see there were boys in

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,480
the picture too everybody was invited

372
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,519
and we were able even to get a high

373
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
school student from up in the united

374
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,800
states to come in via video conference

375
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
this was before we were all doing video

376
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
conference instruction

377
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
so it was pretty exciting my students

378
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
just loved seeing her on the screen and

379
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,279
she taught them how to make the fashion

380
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,040
scene with scratch

381
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,440
we really had a fantastic time so i

382
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
never expected to get a whole girls in

383
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,639
ict fair out of the cyber saturdays but

384
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
i can't honestly say that i did much i

385
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,600
brought my baked beans and the rest of

386
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,920
the whole spread was done by the ladies

387
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,880
from ywca

388
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
and coming around full cycle

389
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,360
our

390
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,519
2016 uvi cyber camp if you want to look

391
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,120
at this picture

392
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,920
um

393
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,399
shows eight female campers so that's a

394
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,279
pretty good ratio i think in one year

395
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
our numbers were starting to build we

396
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,120
were getting on the rise

397
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
this is my 2016 middle school cyber

398
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,680
patriot team my school we would have to

399
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
do a bake sale to pay the registration

400
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
fee for the cyber patriot team

401
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,639
competition but if you have an all girls

402
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,600
team then cyberpatriot waves your fee so

403
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
we put together an all girls team so we

404
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
didn't have to do all the bake sales and

405
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
instead we could practice our cyber

406
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
security tactics

407
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,119
these are all middle school students and

408
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,319
they are all uh the first ever all-girls

409
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,079
team out of my former school

410
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,439
um

411
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
out of that team of seven girls uh one

412
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
of them is now entering 12th grade and

413
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
she's an nc wit national center for

414
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,119
women in information technology national

415
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
award winner in 2020

416
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,160
another one is just graduated she's

entering ganon university this fall to

418
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
study cyber security one is now entering

419
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,679
her sophomore year at our hbcu

420
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,039
university of the virgin islands

421
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,240
studying cyber security one i know is

422
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
going into a stem career i thought it

423
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
was possibly marine science i just found

424
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,559
out yesterday that she tends to be a

425
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,600
double major in biomedical and economics

426
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
and she wants to do

427
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,280
genome studies for the center for

428
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,120
disease control so

429
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,679
that's amazing it is not however cyber

430
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,799
security

431
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,840
but pretty cool

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
uh when we did cyber camp 2017 we had

433
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,600
some more changes we had more girls

434
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,880
but maybe even more important we also

435
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
were able to bring in two female

436
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
instructors uh one of which i worked

437
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
with at my institution

438
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
but who also had a university

439
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,919
affiliation and the other who was a

440
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,360
student at

441
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,280
the university of the virgin islands she

442
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,880
graduated while we were in the midst of

443
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,000
our of our camp i believe but bringing

444
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,120
in local women i mean i'm i'm white and

445
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
most of my students are not and it

446
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
really is true that the more they see

447
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,039
someone who looks like them the better

448
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,320
they're going to be able to relate to

449
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
you and they also relate to young people

450
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,440
i

451
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,919
wasn't 50 plus then but i am now so

452
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,080
having some young women of color

453
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,039
participate as instructors in the camp i

454
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,640
think it really made a difference for us

455
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
it was an excellent change to add um to

456
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
add to the program it just showed that

457
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,360
we were growing and we were bringing

458
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
more people into it

459
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
super exciting

460
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
that's when i decided that i wasn't

461
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
happy with having uvi's camp and i

462
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,320
wanted to have my own camp so i actually

463
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,480
worked with nc wit that's the national

464
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
center for women information technology

465
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
wrote a little grant and we put together

466
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
a summer camp just for girls nc whit

467
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,320
wants the girls to choose a topic that

468
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,039
they feel passionate about and focus

469
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,600
their efforts on that topic so

470
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,400
we

471
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
focused on a couple of different things

472
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
but you can see that my student there

473
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
jessica she worked on her tablet and she

474
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
did a an animation program related to

475
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
global warming

476
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
we brought in some women of color from

477
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
the community who were working

478
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,799
professionally in computer science

479
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,760
related fields one was doing network

480
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
wiring

481
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,080
we had some coders and programmers we

482
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,600
had

483
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,679
people working for the isps about four

484
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
different um

485
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,679
different speakers and yep that's one of

486
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
the ywca ladies she is a retired

487
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
engineer so she came and gave us a talk

488
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,799
about cyber security and computer

489
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,559
science related to

490
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,880
engineering and we just had a wonderful

491
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
time this is

492
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559

494
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,480
the two new instructors in our uvi

495
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
summer cyber camp and they both wanted

496
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
to help us out with our code like a girl

497
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,039
camp one of the best things that came

498

501
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,919
and

502
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,440
she was a national award winner from nc

503
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,080
wit she wrote the grant with me and was

504
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,679
with me all the way organizing this

505
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,159
grant and was able to come over to saint

506
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,919
thomas from texas the year before she

507
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,520
entered the summer before she entered

508
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,280
stanford university

509
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
and she was one of our primary

510
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,720
instructors in this camp as well

511
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
at the end of the camp we were able to

512
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
get one of the auditoriums at uvi we put

513
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,919
together a little forum we were able to

514
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
get a sponsorship through the secor

515
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,039
partnership at uvi to get everybody cute

516
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,520
pink code like a girl t-shirts

517
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
and we put together some of our guest

518
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,720
speakers some of our students some of

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,520
our instructors from the program

520
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,400
and we made a fantastic little panel

521
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,159
group we had a panel of students and we

522
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,440
had a panel of our instructors so we

523
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
were able to invite the entire community

524
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,159
out to join our forum and hear a little

525
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,240
bit about what we had been doing it was

526
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,039
really exciting

527
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
then

528
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,200
after that summer that amazing summer of

529
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,720
17 with so many so many wonderful

530
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
progressions we got hit by the

531
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,679
hurricanes uh these photos of our r of

532
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,080
my school's hour of code celebration

533
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
this is actually not in 2017 it was 2018

534
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
by the time we got around to doing hour

535
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,120
of code because we just didn't really

536
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,159
have any connectivity and often no power

537
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,919
right after the storms at my house we

538
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,159
were out of power for four months um but

539
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,840
the schools they did a little bit better

540
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,039
job and

541
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,360
got us connected a little bit faster we

542
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
still did have hour of code though and

543
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
we really did have a good time

544
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
that's when one of our guest speakers

545
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,159
from the code like a girl camp um

546
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,840
convinced me that we should start a

547
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
girls who code club over there at ubi so

548
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
we did that um that's a 2018 photo but

549
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
we actually started in the fall just a

550
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,919
couple of weeks after the storms hit

551
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,600
so the ladies that you see in the

552
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
picture there were part of the very

553
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
first girls who code club ever in the

554
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,799
usbi it's an amazing organization

555
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
i definitely encourage you to get

556
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
involved with them and they're my

557
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
uh fall 2017 summer patriot team members

558
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
they're thanking one of our sponsors who

559
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
actually put together some t-shirts and

560
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,480
snacks and jump drives for us corporate

561
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,440
sponsorship is always helpful

562
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,720
[Music]

563
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
and that

564
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
is a little bit on how i've been trying

565
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
to spark a journey in my community

566
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,799
i

567
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,200
was asking earlier about

568
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
changes in your community and how you

569
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
might be a part of that

570
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,200
um but that's a little bit of what i've

571
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,559
been doing i'm going to show you a

572
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,639
little bit more and then we'll move on

573
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,799
basically i've tried to focus my efforts

574
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
on what i have seen that works

575
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,840
and those are in

576
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,640
four forks of the pathway competitions

577
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,600
such as cyberpatriot are great of course

578
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,120
i probably don't need to tell anybody

579
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,480
here yet that ctfs are very fun and

580
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,120
motivating for students cyberpatriot is

581
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
a great defensive competition it's

582
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
really exciting meg is actually a very

583
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
successful cyber patriot coach um

584
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,960
and i've enjoyed working in that program

585
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
for for many years now there are other

586
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,679
c2 ctfs out there that are geared to

587
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,240
young people more and more and more all

588
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
the time so that's always something to

589
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,720
check for on google picoctf is really

590
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
good p ico

591
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,440
sans institute which you are probably

592
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
familiar with as a provider of cyber

593
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,720
security

594
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,520
continuing education certificates etc

595
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
they've done a great job with their

596
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,640
cyberstart competition uh and i just

597
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
anybody who is a young person or who is

598
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,640
an educator

599
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,440
of young people if you can share with

600
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
them those competitions are out there

601
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,720
they make it so easy for somebody who is

602
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,520
not a technical wizard such as myself to

603
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
lead the students and get them involved

604
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
they really make it impossible to not do

605
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
the competition because they give you so

606
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,360
much support and help the students get

607
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,440
really excited

608
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,919
i would also say that hands-on practice

609
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,200
in the photos you saw some raspberry pi

610
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,679
development you saw some

611
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,000
lego pie that we were working with legos

612
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,279
are really fun

613
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,600
to add to the raspberry pi experience

614
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
anything with robotics and it doesn't

615
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
always have to be electrified you know

616
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,240
you can build

617
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,520
robots with uh soda straws if you want

618
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,240
to and marshmallows

619
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
but anything that hands on works well

620
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
for the very youngest ones i've always

621
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,480
found that the tablets are fantastic

622
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
they're not so good yet with the mouse

623
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,480
and the keyboard but that doesn't mean

624
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,679
that you can't bring cyber security

625
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,240
programming down even to as young as

626
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,679
three

627
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
because with the tablet you can make a

628
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,679
lot of things possible

629
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,440
increase that local pipeline in my

630
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
community virgin islanders are very very

631
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,720
best and most proud when we include our

632
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,840
local people so although i'm i'm

633
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
definitely a state senator i've been

634
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,640
there a while

635
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,320
um and that's appreciated but it's

636
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,440
really wonderful when you can

637
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,919
develop your population in your own

638
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
community that houses you

639
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,720
and build them up and get them into your

640
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
pipeline and get them mentoring

641
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,720
it just makes

642
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,360
makes the impact that much more powerful

643
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,679
finally inclusion and i've touched on

644
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
that youngest people can be involved in

645
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
these pathways three-year-olds can learn

646
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,919
that keeping your ipad flat on the table

647
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,840
instead of holding it in your lap is a

648
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,919
form of physical security because then

649
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
it doesn't fall on the floor if it's up

650
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
on the table flat

651
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,679
uh things like you know how many windows

652
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,760
does a house have and you know which

653
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,679
house is easier for the bad guys to get

654
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,240
into the one with one window or the one

655
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
with 17 windows all over the place they

656
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,080
can answer that question it makes them

657
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,640
really happy to know about that

658
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,080
and uh boys you know whenever and it has

659
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,039
happened lots of times whenever uh

660
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,520
someone who might not look like a girl

661
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
shows up at one of my programs that

662
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,679
person is embraced with open arms you

663
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,000
know we wouldn't ever turn anybody away

664
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
for any reason so just make sure

665
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,879
everybody is welcome

666
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,679
and here are some photo examples of that

667
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,480
the children in these pictures range uh

668
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
from nursery school age so three and

669
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,840
four year olds all the way up through uh

670
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,640
fifth sixth grade elementary and it

671
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
absolutely is possible to get these guys

672
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,799
involved and they're very excited when

673
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,919
they are

674
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,600
i'm showing them a little bit of scratch

675
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
programming we're working with some

676
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,640
basic robotics using the cubelets

677
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
that are building block robots pretty

678
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
exciting and you know for these young

679
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,320
ones when they're running their first

680
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,440
program that can be a very big deal

681
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,559
and it's um but it makes everybody happy

682
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,559
to see how excited how alive and how

683
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
just full of joy they are when they run

684
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
that first program

685
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,039
for the older ones

686
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,200
it's always good to

687
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
include them

688
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,679
yes but start to give them a chance to

689
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,960
lead those younger ones just as the

690
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
bigger ones like to have young people

691
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
from the university instruct them that's

692
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
their favorite for the very youngest

693
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,559
ones in the elementary school they love

694
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,279
to have the big kids come and work with

695
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,159
them

696
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,640
so after a few years of working with

697
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,679
these programs i had a core group of big

698
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,720
kids who i knew i could rely on whenever

699
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
we did a fair an event a saturday or

700
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,440
anything after school

701
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,799
they would um be my team and they would

702
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,279
be the ones uh working with the younger

703
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,720
kids so it builds their self-esteem

704
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
teenagers sometimes have a hard time

705
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,799
with their self-esteem one of the things

706
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,559
that makes them feel good is doing

707
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,559
something for others and it makes them

708
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,279
feel like they've got ownership of this

709
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,679
knowledge they do know a thing or two

710
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,120
teaching the younger ones makes them

711
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,799
really happy especially when they see

712
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,880
that the younger ones are so so happy as

713
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,760
well

714
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
i want to point out in this photo that

715
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,159
one of the young people from the

716
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,200
earliest cyber camp photo showed matthew

717
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,679
he was in senior a senior in high school

718
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,640
at the time and here he is back again

719
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
now he is a university student and now

720
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
he's participating as one of the big

721
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,880
kids team helping out with these

722
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
initiatives and he does that all the

723
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
time so he used to be in the camp

724
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,279
now he's leading these camp events

725
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
that said

726
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,440
we don't want the older ones to just

727
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
teach they wouldn't like it if that was

728
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,679
their only responsibility they very much

729
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,320
want to keep learning so even the ones

730
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,840
who are kind of in the big kids section

731
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
now they don't want to spend their

732
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,000
entire time as junior instructor

733
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,919
instructors now they they want to

734
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,600
explore new stuff too so we added high

735
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
school cyber patriot teams to the middle

736
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
school cyber patriot teams we kept them

737
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
involved doing hands-on sometimes the

738
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,279
big kids like to use the cubelets as you

739
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
see on the right here and use the

740
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,279
building block robots so there's nothing

741
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,880
wrong with doing that every now and then

742
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,480
letting them have some fun

743
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,679
um

744
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,360
down at the bottom they're using each

745
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,720
other as a human piano to play notes

746
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,559
and they can

747
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
enjoy um

748
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,399
continuing their own learning

749
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,640
when they succeed you have to celebrate

750
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
sometimes for those big kids

751
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,039
it's just like for the little kids it's

752
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,840
still run your first program i am

753
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,399
introducing students who are unfamiliar

754
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,039
with computer science and cyber security

755
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,600
every semester every year and so it's

756
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,520
always somebody's turn to run their

757
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,600
first program which isn't always in the

758
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
trinket pythons a lot of different

759
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,720
platforms but it's always fun when

760
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,640
somebody runs their first program hello

761
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,760
world here i am i've i've arrived on the

762
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,240
cyber security pathway it can also be

763
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,159
getting points in cyber patriots cyber

764
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,679
patriots super motivating because

765
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,360
whenever you get points for your team it

766
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
says

767
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,159
my kids tell me that's a video game

768
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,440
sound from

769
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,120
some video game that i don't know but

770
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
they they love it when those when that

771
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,559
points alert comes on

772
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,559
uh sometimes it's celebrating that you

773
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
even have a cyber patriot team in the

774
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,159
middle of covet even if you have to

775
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,000
compete in mass even if you have to

776
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,080
compete from different houses

777
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
that was difficult

778
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
um but you got to celebrate that i had

779
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,760
students who were in the sands

780
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,679
competition

781
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,519
last year i had a team go to the

782
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,279
national championship this year i had a

783
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,320
bunch of students who were

784
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,960
semi-finalists and that i had

785
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,799
one go all the way to the finals and

786
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,440
become an official cyber scholar got a

787
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,480
scholarship

788
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,360
and then i had a student who uh just

789
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,679
like krithika iyer in the code like a

790
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,399
girl camp had won the nc wit national

791
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,799
computer science award well this young

792
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,080
lady who was in the camp with grithika

793
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
when she was in 10th grade she got that

794
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,799
very same award so now she can actually

795
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,559
be a partner and run her own camps

796
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,480
we're winding down on time are you

797
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
winding down too i

798
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,919
am uh

799
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
so some suggested part i could go all

800
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
day meg i warned you about that you did

801
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
warn me

802
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,519
thank you so much so great partners i

803
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,320
mean the ywca was great uh some of the

804
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,159
photos you've seen come from the women

805
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,200
of 18t locally who always sponsor event

806
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
days i've mentioned girls who coded nc

807
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,360
wit i'm a big fan of the cyber

808
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
innovation center i'm going to show you

809
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,039
a photo from one of their programs

810
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,320
that's me

811
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,080
building my very first program i hate

812
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,760
that picture of myself but i love what

813
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,919
demonstrates that's

814
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,760
the first time i ever built a robot and

815
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,399
i was pretty pretty proud so we all know

816
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,080
professional development has to keep

817
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
going so learn

818
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,760
mentor

819
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,360
when you be when you're a mentor it

820
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,039
builds your self-esteem builds your

821
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,880
network and it helps you to know what to

822
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,039
look for in your own mentors and without

823
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,039
mentors you wouldn't get moments like

824
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,039
that

825
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,159
inspire

826
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,320
uh neither of these two young ladies

827
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,360
ever thought they were going to do

828
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
anything with robotics but

829
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,279
given a little bit of a taste of it they

830
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,799
absolutely

831
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,799
loved it so find ways to inspire them

832
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,960
and never ever give up even if there are
