1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
ah thank you someone for introducing me

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,720
hello guys i'm sindhuja rao and

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,800
welcome to the first session of the day

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,279
on trust me i'm an insider deep dive

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,519
into zero trust security

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
so um i have a big lineup of agenda here

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
so we'll start off with how does this

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
current security practice look like the

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,760
what why and how of zero trust what goes

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
into it and i'll wrap up the session

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
with some action item for you guys and i

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,160
want this session to be as interactive

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,719
as possible so do post your questions at

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,680
any point in the chat and i'll go over

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
them at the end of the session or if i

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
just get tired of talking i also have a

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
small quiz at the end so

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
uh yeah do stick around

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,000
now um this might be a controversial

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,480
slide to begin with but i want you to

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
take a moment and think about when was

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,920
the last time you thought of any of

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,119
these things

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
uh when was the last time you changed

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
your credentials without a warning from

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,960
your company or thought about what

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
encryption actually goes into your

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,320
application

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
uh if you haven't gotten promoted or

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,799
changed your teams recently had you

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
thought of revoking your previous

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
accesses or resources

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
now it doesn't mean that anyone is a bad

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
employee for any of doing any of these

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
things but it is one of the many

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
glitches that we have in our systems

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,079
we just don't do user behavior analysis

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,400
within the organization properly

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
uh the reason i say that is because

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,240
about 34 of data leakage cases come from

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
inside of an organization and out of

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,079
which 90

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,399
attacks come from phishing emails which

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,119
trigger ransomware attack very often and

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,920
yes drive by downloads are very real

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
employees do click on friendly links

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
that can break their system in one go

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,840
so if someone's new to this ransomware

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
is when an attacker takes hostage of

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
your data encrypts it and then shares

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
the decrypting cr key for those files

52
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,360
only for an exchange of a hefty ransom

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,840
uh typically in bitcoins

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,599
and unfortunately we have been seeing

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
more and more of these attacks recently

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
say the supply chain attack on solar

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
winds or the recent kazia attacks we

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,800
which have uh affected more than a

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
thousand businesses

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
so

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
some facts about the kazaya attack uh

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
kazee is a company that provides

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
something called managed services or

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,680
msps and many businesses that are part

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,959
of the

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
supply chain attacks are mostly msps as

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
well

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
they provide virtual system or server

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,200
administration to monitor and manage

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
infrastructure of businesses like

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
supermarkets banks etc

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
we honestly still don't know the full

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
impact that the our evil or rebel group

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
has done yet but uh what they did was

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
they found a zero-day vulnerability in

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
one of the on-premise bsa servers so

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,720
interestingly they use something called

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
side loading where they

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
where the actual dll of the malware was

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
executed by attacking the payload of a

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,159
legit windows anti-malware executable

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
file which is i guess it was built in

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
2014 and most uh probably they took the

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
advantage of which also shapes an

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,680
important discuss discussion on patches

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
but we also now

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599
attacks on businesses are very common

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
but we also saw something very more uh

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
much more severe happened during the

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,879
pandemic

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
about 92

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,599
ransomware attacks happened almost every

93
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,400
day on healthcare sector this affected

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,599
600 different healthcare organizations

95
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,159
about 18 million patient records were

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,400
leaked and this resulted in losses of

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
about 21 billion dollars

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
but why this sector

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
for starters

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
healthcare industry is known to run one

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
of the oldest systems when it comes to

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
data processing so running decayed old

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
software uh using iot devices that have

104
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
maybe never been scanned and most

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,879
importantly the human factors

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
everyone was so busy in hospitals that

107
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,959
it served as a perfect distraction for

108
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
the attacks

109
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,680
and that's what the attackers are

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
looking to take advantage of

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
and due to the need of the r they knew

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
that hospitals being so critical needed

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
their services back asap so they knew

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
that they would pay the ransom

115
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
and it's astonishing to see how

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,919
ransomware has evolved to a point where

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,520
it's no longer

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
done as a sidekick thing they run a

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
legitimate business now they're hiring

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
professional negotiators saying hey if

121
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
you can't pay a million dollars how

122
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
about we settle for a half a million or

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
something so they're not messing around

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,680
with their business

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
and this has evolved to something called

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
a black male wear model and with this

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
blackmail model they don't want to hurt

128
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
their media reputation so if you ask me

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
most likely they're going to give your

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
data back

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
but that doesn't mean that they don't

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
already have a copy of your data ready

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
to be sold in the black market or on the

134
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400
dark web

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
so just to paint a pretty picture

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
imagine you in a power plant which is

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,039
fully automated and one day the whole

138
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,720
grid goes down uh on lock down and uh

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
you are inside and there's no way of

140
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
getting out

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
why

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
maybe the iot maybe the software the

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
people your ignorance or might as well

144
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
be the illuminati if you ask me

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
so now i don't know about you but that's

146
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,639
a mr robot episode i don't want to be

147
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,759
part of

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,919
so one question is always up for debate

149
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
in these uh news so

150
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
should you pay the ransom money or not

151
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
and that's a very important question i

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
want you to ask yourselves and answer it

153
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
at the end of the session

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,400
so when i'm getting as it that is

155
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,240
despite companies spending so much

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,039
resources on security these data breach

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
news are always out there right and it's

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
very costly companies need to pay a lot

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
of money not only to save their

160
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,000
businesses but in litigations government

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,919
disclosures and honestly getting the

162
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,160
trust back of their customers is morally

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
very costlier

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
also the way we're working has changed

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
you're now able to log in uh to work

166
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,880
from your ipads and phones but the

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
current security scenario cannot keep up

168
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
with the variety of devices and the data

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
usage which seems to be nowhere

170
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
decreasing

171
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
so the same rule checks that you run for

172
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
your workstation they won't work for

173
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
your personal devices but what would

174
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,400
work

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
will be the exploit

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
so

177
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
we need something more robust here

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
and finally it is important to

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
understand that just because one

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
connects to a secure organization

181
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,319
uh the end point which is you the user

182
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
or the device doesn't become secure

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,120
itself

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
it is still vulnerable as much as it was

185
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,599
before and actually possess a threat not

186
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,039
only to itself

187
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,440
but to the lateral movement of traffic

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,919
inside the organization and can spread

189
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,720
far more quickly than you can save it

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
so protecting customer data is no longer

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
the only requirement

192
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
the organization's data is equally

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,919
vulnerable hence what zerotrust

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,840
basically talks about is building trust

195
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,160
with resources and devices equally

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
inside and outside your network uh how

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,319
by not trusting either of them

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
so what does zero trust bring to the

199
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,440
table

200
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,240
uh the current approach based is more on

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
static and network-based perimeters like

202
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
network location or the ip addresses

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
what's new is now we focus more on the

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,680
users assets resources instead of the

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
network itself which kind of makes sense

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
because the originator of traffic and

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
the exploits in most of the cases are

208
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,759
among these

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
also if you have ever dealt with a deny

210
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
implicit deny rule uh with an access

211
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,319
control list that's an approach just

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,400
because your username is admin you

213
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,960
shouldn't be given full privileges

214
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
and privilege escalation attacks are

215
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,479
often exploited this way

216
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,319
rules should be built around denying

217
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,800
access by default rather than allowing

218
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,759
them even with some level of access

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,400
also the linear approach revolves around

220
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
threat by nature

221
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
how to recover from it and then decide

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,720
how to mitigate it however the approach

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
should be from ground level to limit

224
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,960
those chances rather than taking them

225
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,479
but of course it doesn't mean that

226
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,479
threat hunting is any less fun in zero

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,520
trust

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
it actually plays a pivotal role and

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,958
rather takes threat hunting more

230
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,679
rigorously and can be modeled to act in

231
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
real time using orchestration studying

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,839
io iocs or etc

233
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,560
so a small history lesson xero trust

234
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
began as a discussion in 2004 in the

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
georgio forum which was held by a lot of

236
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
csos and some vendors after a lot of

237
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,279
discussion on uh the concept of killing

238
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,160
the perimeter we saw google being the

239
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
public face for zero trust after the

240
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
years of research and development and

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
introduced beyond corp in around 2014

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,600
but this was mostly built for developers

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
in cloud infrastructure so it was not a

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
big hit in the marketplace so forrester

245
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
then changed the original design a bit

246
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,880
in about 2017 and said hey data is the

247
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
center of the universe so we should

248
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
focus on how to manage it classify it

249
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
categorize it and most importantly

250
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
protect it

251
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,279
and meanwhile carter then created their

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
own model called carta a continuous

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
adaptive risk and trust assessment which

254
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
focused more on how to tackle risks

255
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,959
inside and outside of a network and more

256
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,000
or less this also kind of shaped how the

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,839
xero trust architecture looks today as

258
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
an industrial standard so we can think

259
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
of it in a cyclic structure

260
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
giving the endpoints a hard time

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
verifying themselves when they do

262
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
don't take them for granted and don't

263
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
forget about them because they're always

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
suspicious

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
now one question might arise uh that why

266
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
are we talking about zero trust security

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
now even when it was coined back in you

268
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,920
know 20

269
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
2004 right the problem was uh even

270
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
though knowing the advantages of zero

271
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
trust it was not easy to implement as

272
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,839
the network changed a lot through the

273
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
years we went from on-site data centers

274
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
to cloud perimeters and also because of

275
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
the cost it came along with it but now

276
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,920
we are at a point where we accept the

277
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,959
fact that just like the it perimeter our

278
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,279
networks are also changing so that

279
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,519
doesn't mean we run the same old

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,240
same decade old security structure right

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
and

282
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
we are also able to implement complex

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,959
scenarios and network designs easily

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,360
thanks to the available resources in

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
technology as well as the brilliant

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
engineers architects

287
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
architects and network admins that we

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
have today

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
so the type of networks devices control

290
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,320
systems iot software or whatever you say

291
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,959
it is all demanding zero trust as an

292
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,480
extension

293
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,959
and uh when we talk about the zero trust

294
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,880
extended uh or ztx framework there there

295
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
are about seven pillars to it that

296
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
forester in their audits also determine

297
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,640
in the industry to decide

298
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
who is doing a better job at

299
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
implementing these uh zero trust

300
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,920
principles uh you know for their

301
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
customers uh the pillars are network

302
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
data people

303
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
uh workload devices visibility and

304
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
analytics and automation and

305
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
orchestration

306
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,200
so when you want to implement the ztx

307
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
framework answering the following

308
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
questions gives you an idea about how to

309
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,079
implement it for example what are the

310
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
firewalls rules you will be using how

311
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
are you controlling your data how are

312
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
you encrypting it

313
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,440
uh how are you how are the people in

314
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,839
organization understanding security how

315
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
are you identifying devices which is one

316
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
of the main concerns and im comes into

317
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
picture there well which i'll discuss

318
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
later and based on these answers we have

319
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
some of leaders and strong performers

320
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
in these fields

321
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
which also obviously keep on changing uh

322
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
perk water

323
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
so um

324
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
if we look at the architecture this is

325
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,519
kind of the ideal model for zero truss

326
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,040
developed by national institute of

327
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
standards and technology

328
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,360
in this the policy decision point is

329
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,880
kind of the cpu of the computer and it

330
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
consists of the policy engine which is

331
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,760
responsible for the ultimate decision to

332
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
later to grant

333
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
deny or revoke access uh to the resource

334
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
the policy administrator is like the

335
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
middleman between the

336
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
control plane and the data plane so it

337
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,720
will command whatever action it receives

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
from the policy engine to the policy

339
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,399
enforcement point

340
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
and this is a part of the data plane

341
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,279
which sits behind the requester uh and

342
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,160
the resource so this pp would be what

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
the requester is going to interact at

344
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
all points so it can be a firewall maybe

345
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
even a login page for that matter

346
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
so for this pdp to work the architect or

347
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
admin should feed some external

348
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,120
constraints and rules

349
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
so they can be like should the device be

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
at a particular industrial standard

351
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
uh how to validate a certificate in

352
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
network what should be your ca or maybe

353
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
what user belongs to which group how

354
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
does the

355
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
active directory tree search happen as

356
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
input into a trust algorithm which also

357
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,839
i'll discuss

358
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,560
sorry now a lot of companies nowadays

359
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
prefer building their own models and

360
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
architectures so you might find an

361
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,000
additional trust engine or pe and pa to

362
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
be in the same unit you know stuff like

363
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
that but they're mostly based off on

364
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
this model

365
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
and one of the variations of zero trust

366
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
is micro segmentation

367
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,839
as the name suggests it segments your

368
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,199
network into

369
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,680
uh to install multiple pps for your

370
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,839
smaller perimeters basically break down

371
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,240
the network into small segments and this

372
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
also kind of shapes the cyber security

373
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
mesh

374
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,480
this is like your charizard of our

375
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
charmander okay so cyber security mesh

376
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,560
or cmesh as i call it so only i call it

377
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,399
so is the extension of the ztx framework

378
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,839
where we give a lot of importance to the

379
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,720
departmentization part

380
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
this mesh

381
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
shifts the focus from implementing pps

382
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
at the perimeter to a custom-made

383
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
identity based verification approach

384
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
still keeping the orchestration

385
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
centrally so that any threat remediation

386
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
can happen simultaneously on all nodes

387
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639
which helps us to minimize the lateral

388
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,120
movement of any attack vectors

389
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
so now your id team can create smaller

390
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
perimeters well if you still want to

391
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,560
call that and this distributed

392
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
architecture can have its own set of

393
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
rules one own pp's pdps etc

394
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
they don't have to interact with each

395
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
other they can vary depending on zts

396
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
pillars we talked about at each level so

397
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,240
for example one layer can be for bring

398
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,120
your own devices uh

399
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,560
type of network connecting to the

400
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
corporate which would have its own set

401
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,360
of rules another layer can be for remote

402
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,399
access users and each of these layers

403
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,639
can further have separate application

404
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,880
layer security rules creating kind of

405
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
the mesh which gives its name

406
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,279
and this gives let's go for cyber

407
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
criminals and hackers to exploit an

408
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
entire network again meaning less

409
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
lateral movement that we're aiming for

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,600
so uh one thing here the ztx and cs mesh

411
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
in my opinion can be interchanged

412
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,639
because

413
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,800
they're basically fancier names for the

414
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,199
root zero trust principles that we

415
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,040
already know so i'll be using them

416
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
interchangeably so

417
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,120
uh please don't sue me

418
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
so now the goal for these approaches uh

419
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
when we are talking about network

420
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
requirements is always the same protect

421
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
the resources and requesters from

422
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,639
harming each other

423
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
to make that decision on pp and

424
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,839
implement the cyber security mesh one

425
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,320
should know majorly what type of assets

426
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,279
are in the deployments because rule for

427
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,440
company assets will differ from the

428
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,759
rules for personal devices or an iot

429
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
device that belongs to the network

430
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,880
infrastructure

431
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
which is issued to the organizers

432
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,639
organization itself right

433
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,120
and the patent flow visibility is very

434
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
important as it defines how we can

435
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
continuously maintain that trust that

436
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,759
we've been talking about so ips

437
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,800
inspection on the pp and over the

438
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,240
network is something one should consider

439
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
also never let the requester interact

440
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
with the resource directly it's like

441
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,440
inviting satan for dinner it's not going

442
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
to go well

443
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
lastly enterprise assets may not be

444
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,519
reachable to certain pps based on asset

445
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
parameters for for example

446
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
mobile assets might get a different

447
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,600
login page

448
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,519
than remote users or the on-premise

449
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,160
users so depending on user experience

450
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
you can also make those changes now

451
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
there are other uh many other approaches

452
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
and network requirements to consider

453
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,439
which will be

454
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,199
you know which will change based on type

455
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
of network devices available importance

456
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,799
of the resources uh number of requesters

457
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,880
and how scalable is your deployment and

458
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,319
the cost that can be allocated for them

459
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
now um

460
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
since the pandemic started most of us

461
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,240
are working from home remotely so

462
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,160
this scenario is kind of what makes

463
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,640
sense to me to discuss with you

464
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
uh so what do we need we need a headed

465
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,160
that smart whether users can terminate

466
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
their sessions it can be a firewall

467
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,039
router

468
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,200
and uh

469
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
and i cannot stress enough on the

470
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
importance of encrypting maintaining the

471
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,559
integrity and authenticity of the

472
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
traffic that goes across this deployment

473
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
then choose a happy pp or policy

474
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,559
enforcement point this will help with

475
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,520
authenticating the users again just

476
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,919
username passwords will not work your

477
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,480
beloved admin 123 passwords can be

478
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,799
cracked in less than a second so we need

479
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,880
more than that definitely

480
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,720
authentication bytes itself is not

481
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,480
enough so we also need the policy

482
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
engines and pdps in place and uh we need

483
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
dynamic policy as you might have

484
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
observed in the architecture static

485
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,080
rules are no good in zero trust

486
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,039
often missed but but very very important

487
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
when you want to go back and find out

488
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
what was done is logging the sessions so

489
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
this can be syslog servers your

490
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
monitoring tools etc etc

491
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
and major pillar of zero trust to

492
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
continue monitor the traffic in the

493
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
network is a cherry on the cake if you

494
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,640
can have the thread defense tools

495
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
integrated at all possible uh

496
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
points of interception of potential

497
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
attacks

498
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,400
now one thing to notice is why i didn't

499
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
put this in a linear list of these these

500
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,919
ingredients is because that's the beauty

501
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,360
of uh

502
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
you know zero trust extended you don't

503
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
have to start at a single point you can

504
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
first choose your im server for example

505
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,559
make rules there and then integrate the

506
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
other sections of the framework

507
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
similarly you can begin

508
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
with your threat orchestration tool or

509
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
logging method and then move on to your

510
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,640
header deployment

511
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
and this stands true for remote access

512
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
user or on-premise user application

513
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
anywhere

514
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
now i can't just uh discuss the whole

515
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
end-to-end implementation otherwise

516
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
we'll be sitting here till the tdi ends

517
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
so i'll uh try to cover with a simple

518
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
example

519
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
so starting off with

520
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
next generation firewalls understanding

521
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
them now of course there's nothing wrong

522
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,280
with the existing firewalls with respect

523
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,640
to security

524
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,520
but uh for zero trust a next generation

525
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
firewall is a better fit because of its

526
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,240
more flexible approach towards security

527
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
by that i mean it has a better

528
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
perception of ciphers inclusion and

529
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,280
remediation of old ciphers things like

530
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,039
that so you can create multiple

531
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,000
sub-instances from a single instance and

532
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
also host it over cloud services in a

533
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
lightweight fashion we also have more

534
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,559
granularity over the net

535
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,280
uh traffic or network which uh so the

536
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
intrusion prevention system that we use

537
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,840
is what defines a line between a normal

538
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,799
firewall and a next generation firewall

539
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,799
you can also integrate the uh next

540
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,240
generation firewall with multiple

541
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
services for incident response and

542
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
threat detection

543
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
and also it's easier to integrate them

544
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,039
using network automation tools such as

545
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,520
apis uh and

546
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,360
apis and other tools

547
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,720
now

548
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,200
i am is a very big part of the

549
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
discussion as it helps us to create

550
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
identity based rules that i've been

551
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,640
mentioning

552
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
so this is your policy engine your brain

553
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
or your trust engine the pdp whatever

554
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
you want to call it so from verification

555
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,760
trusting

556
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
discarding and then upholding privileged

557
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,960
access management this guy does it all

558
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
now many firewalls can do a lot of these

559
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
things but in my opinion leveraging

560
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,159
these duties to an expert like i am

561
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
reduces a large overhead on the

562
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
firewalls as they have their own set of

563
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,600
operations to worry about so

564
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,080
uh that's a bit of approach so iron

565
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,720
functions with three main branches

566
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,919
so authentication is who is connecting

567
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,240
how did we verify the endpoints and now

568
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
with zero trust authentication is the

569
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
first contact with the attack surface

570
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,880
so your single factor authentication of

571
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,000
eep is not going to work here and so we

572
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,919
have evolved gladly to multi-factor

573
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
authentication many of us might be using

574
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,480
it already maybe when connecting to your

575
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
school or workplace

576
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,960
for example do a push rsa code

577
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,840
certificate with eth and smart cards

578
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
with credentials etc

579
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
authorization is okay

580
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
user was able to connect but what access

581
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
should they get

582
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,120
do they belong to the itt if yes what

583
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,280
necessary minimum workloads should be

584
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
assigned to them so basically everything

585
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,280
about privilege access

586
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
and accounting is how much data is the

587
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
user consuming

588
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
when did they log in are the session

589
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,960
cookies active without their work all

590
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,039
these go into data billings for that

591
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,039
user so that it can be tracked if

592
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,039
required on the im server

593
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,520
therefore a lot of times your im server

594
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,200
is also referred to as your aaa server

595
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
so i've been chanting this word trust

596
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
for about i guess 99 times till now

597
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
right but understanding trust is trust

598
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,720
is one thing and measuring it is totally

599
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,880
different we need to drop down to the

600
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
server level to conclude the end point

601
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,039
should be trusted or not

602
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,679
this is done broadly in five categories

603
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
uh the supplicant which is essentially

604
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,679
the endpoint which sends the eep request

605
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,480
to a middleman like a wlc firewall or

606
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,440
switch

607
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,919
it forwards the access request which

608
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,520
which is a radius packet in most of the

609
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
cases to the im server or your policy

610
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,039
engine

611
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,520
subjects data and database are your

612
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,400
active directory active directory lap

613
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,880
server uh wherever your user database

614
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,200
exists and the contextual information

615
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
history that gets shared with the im

616
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,400
server

617
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
asset database is essentially the same

618
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,520
thing but for the endpoints

619
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,760
policy requirements are the rules that

620
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,240
get created the minimum requirements

621
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,799
before granting or denying access to an

622
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
endpoint or the user through something

623
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
called profiling and posturing

624
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,080
and lastly threat intelligence and logs

625
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
are everything in a circular manner how

626
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
you act on your trust conclusion

627
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,559
depending on the threat info available

628
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,200
do you still trust the user on endpoint

629
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,360
if not what action will you take and the

630
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
same rules you create on the policy

631
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,159
engine

632
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,559
so all these things constitute basically

633
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,320
a permit or a deny rule to the requester

634
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,960
now to quantify the trust we leverage

635
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520
something called profiling and probing

636
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,320
uh let's take an example say i create a

637
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
brownie point system to find out if a

638
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
workstation that's connecting to my

639
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
network is a windows 10 machine or not

640
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,480
so

641
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,440
uh yeah no not that kind of promise so

642
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,000
i'll give it 10 points if the end point

643
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,840
is from

644
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,679
microsoft let's say that happens but i

645
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,000
still can't grant it access because the

646
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,480
score is too low so i profile it for

647
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,559
more information

648
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,320
if i get to know that it's a microsoft

649
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,200
product and it's a windows system i have

650
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,919
i hand out further points and on further

651
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,400
enquiring i get that if this is a

652
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,440
microsoft machine and also windows 10 so

653
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,279
i reward it with the highest brownie

654
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,320
points

655
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,480
so we started out

656
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
with not knowing anything about the

657
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
device that's coming in so and we

658
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
concluded it with that this is a windows

659
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,520
10 machine and with that i changed the

660
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,279
profile of this guy from an unknown

661
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
profile to a windows 10 profile

662
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
and there's actually a scoring database

663
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,960
that is built on the im servers which

664
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,279
are way more rigorous than my example

665
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,320
and way less generous than opera

666
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
so

667
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
in the background if you want to know

668
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
what's happening there's a radius packet

669
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,880
that contains several attributes like

670
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,440
the framed ip address oui and other

671
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,640
attributes

672
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
the oei for most of its part has vendor

673
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
specifications which might include msft

674
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
and the dota packet in the dhcp would

675
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,799
have a class identifier field that has

676
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,279
msft enabled in it which proves that

677
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,080
it's an msft device and meanwhile this

678
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,279
is happening

679
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,600
the endpoint prompt gets prompted with

680
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,919
something called a guest portal when the

681
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,200
user generates a http or https probe to

682
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
this portal the field of ip user agent

683
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,440
field contains the windows nt 10.0

684
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,640
information

685
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,720
and all these steps tell us what we

686
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
wanted to know about the endpoint so the

687
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,919
goal at the end of this communication is

688
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
the im server should learn these details

689
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,360
so that the admin can create the rules

690
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,000
the authorization profiles and policies

691
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,960
etc in order to know how to categorize

692
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,600
the devices as we saw this is one of the

693
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,159
pillars for the ztx framework

694
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,640
and once this profile is done

695
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,520
uh a coa gets kicked off

696
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
so uh let's say you took a window you

697
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,760
took the same windows 10 machine at an

698
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,080
airport to serve some netflix while you

699
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
were waiting for your flight the first

700
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,720
least access given to this machine would

701
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,520
be

702
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,600
to the guest portal now this portal

703
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,919
would be where you may enter your name

704
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,480
phone number other information so that

705
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,120
the internet access to browse netflix is

706
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,279
via the iam server

707
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
now every time we do a profile or a

708
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,840
posture check we make a result which is

709
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
either the endpoint is a compliant one

710
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
or a non-compliant one

711
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,840
there's also a third state for posture

712
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,679
called unknown but let's just stick to

713
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
these two right now

714
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,679
so when that guest portal is accessed

715
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,400
for netflix the im server pushes a

716
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
dynamic access list or dapple on the

717
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,279
machine to give it internet access and

718
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
no corporate access

719
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,559
and

720
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,559
you can then fine tune this dial as per

721
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,120
your parameters for example for a remote

722
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,799
user case it would be different for a

723
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,799
guest user it will be different and so

724
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,600
on

725
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,799
with that a coa gets generated which is

726
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,640
change of authorization

727
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,039
so for our remote access user case if

728
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
you decide to connect to vpn for an

729
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,080
internal corporate site or for some work

730
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,640
after your movie a coi will kick off

731
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,360
again and the nad device network access

732
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,799
device or

733
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,720
authenticator in our case which is the

734
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
firewall is prompted to re-authenticate

735
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,760
you and change the profile associated

736
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,279
with this end point

737
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,799
so if you decide that you're going to

738
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,919
download a pirated game after your work

739
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,000
should your trust profile still remain

740
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,039
the same

741
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,159
uh i mean

742
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
no right so since that beats the whole

743
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,919
purpose of setix principle of the

744
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,159
continuous evaluation

745
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,399
so if you're browsing malicious site or

746
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,360
malvertising the cui sent can trigger

747
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
terminate session flag or disable host

748
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
port flag so that it cannot affect any

749
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
peer devices especially when you're on a

750
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,760
shared network such as airport

751
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,480
so

752
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
um what's posture

753
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
in its most basic form it's a condition

754
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,000
check

755
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,360
uh the the rules that i've been

756
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,520
mentioning that your im

757
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,000
admins should decide to make so if you

758
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
are one you can create those small

759
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,159
perimeter rules by checking for example

760
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,000
uh there should be a particular

761
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,720
antivirus installed the windows 10 which

762
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,799
is connecting should be of the latest

763
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,760
patch say there should not be a usb in

764
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
use of this on the system's hardware

765
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
maybe because it's trying to introduce a

766
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,360
rogue device into the network which you

767
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,760
don't want so rules like that

768
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,640
uh you can also create compound checks

769
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
with multiple rules as well and each

770
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,559
result against creates a coa and based

771
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,640
on this you can grant or deny or

772
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,440
quarantine the entry of a

773
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
resource

774
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,080
again with zero trust and cs mesh the

775
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,240
posture helps in creating a custom rule

776
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,880
for each perimeter if you are at

777
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,120
application layer your posture rules are

778
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,279
going to be different if you are on a

779
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,039
remote location your posture rules would

780
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,039
be focusing on something else and they

781
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,120
can coexist in harmony

782
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080
so

783
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
in the background again on the left we

784
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,159
can see we can have users coming in via

785
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,640
different methods like vpn web auth

786
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,279
wired wireless and their access request

787
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,440
is sent to the im server and that

788
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,919
authentication and authorization is done

789
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,000
based on the rules created

790
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
this can be done using saml for cloud

791
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,360
parameters or ad ldap certificate

792
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
authorities and simultaneously for

793
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,760
multi-factor authentication

794
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,440
multivendor support is always a good

795
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,279
thing on your server

796
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,880
and some of the standard recommended

797
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
protocols that we'll use to pass on this

798
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,120
information would be 802.1 x map web

799
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,480
auth ms chap v2 etc

800
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,559
now we have the i am part done this is

801
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,399
the end of it now

802
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,159
uh i'm pretty sure you'd be lying if you

803
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,919
said a year back your work from home

804
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,399
started smoothly especially when you're

805
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,600
a migrated user like me from my desk at

806
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,559
office to my broken table at home but

807
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,480
vpn did save us there

808
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,200
and not only we have been using vpn for

809
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,640
schools for work it also has helped us

810
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,880
to keep us entertained as well which uh

811
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
i see i don't want to get in trouble for

812
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,279
so but interestingly during my research

813
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,440
for this talk i found articles and

814
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,919
opinions about how xero trust is the

815
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,960
next generation vpn and it replaces it

816
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
uh i would assume that it might be the

817
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,600
thoughts due to some of the myths around

818
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,320
it

819
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,279
and uh fun fact i i work with vpn every

820
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,600
day so i got to defend it

821
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,480
so xero trust doesn't talk about cia

822
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
principles by nature

823
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,480
it does have values of it of course but

824
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,559
we do need some tool to implement the

825
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,039
same so assuming that you're always on a

826
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,960
public network is a good way to

827
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,159
incorporate encryption in your business

828
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,799
and no vpn does not only work from

829
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
outside it doesn't segregate your

830
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
traffic based on perimeter so for

831
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
example if you're a federal body your

832
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,440
inside data is as vulnerable and as

833
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
important as your outside data so you

834
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,640
can leverage vpn for your uh for your

835
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,559
network in that manner

836
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,000
also at this point i would blame your

837
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,880
network architect if they told they tell

838
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
you that vpn users get full access by

839
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,679
default this is one of the biggest myths

840
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,480
vpn does not talk about full access it

841
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,159
totally depends on the rules you're

842
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,320
implementing on your head end and your

843
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,640
im server to assign privileges to your

844
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
remote users just like you will do it

845
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
for non-remote users

846
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,279
lastly vpn has gone grown through the

847
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,399
years as well we have uh incorporated so

848
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,440
much of the multi-vendor support and all

849
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
of the vpn uh applications that are out

850
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,960
there they do have one of the latest

851
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,039
technologies as well as latest features

852
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,480
to help you have just a better

853
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
experience of vpn

854
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,039
so what i suggest my customers generally

855
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,080
is

856
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,480
if you have vpn embrace it

857
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,159
and build zero trust upon it

858
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,960
now the part where trust centric meets

859
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,159
threat centric some of the key things uh

860
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,840
is uh so

861
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,279
some of the key things that the threat

862
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,679
detection and incident response focuses

863
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,080
on are the continuous evaluation of the

864
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,760
trust in zero trust

865
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,919
so in the security world it's always

866
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,600
good to be suspicious

867
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,760
uh so this can be done in many ways you

868
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,600
can integrate your thread detection

869
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
tools with your im server or with your

870
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
pps like firewalls have cloud-based

871
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,320
central administrator

872
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
administrator services on lease it can

873
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,039
be from your organization or leveraged

874
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
as a service from a different window

875
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
i mean whatever works for your network

876
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,799
one interesting thing about evolution of

877
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,320
threat hunting has been the

878
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,960
orchestration part uh imagine a

879
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,679
flowchart with rules created for many

880
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,760
possibilities say what happens when a

881
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,399
malware is detected what action should

882
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,360
your user take how would your im server

883
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,919
react to it uh yada

884
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,240
now your orchestrator will uh not

885
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,159
manually implement these actions

886
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,240
directly of course so there is the

887
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,399
automation part and using services like

888
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,880
apis and security service exchange to

889
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,159
implement these tasks are always handy

890
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,840
and many of the vendors in accordance

891
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,200
with the extended

892
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
uh detection and response are already

893
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
doing that

894
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,399
so

895
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,960
logging things just makes life easier

896
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,880
for anyone who wants to work with thread

897
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,159
hunting what happened when happened to

898
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
whom did it happen

899
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,640
how long was the outage all these

900
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,679
questions are very real and most of the

901
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,679
times they get unanswered

902
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,000
so even if you get a downtime in your

903
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,679
business you might have noticed that the

904
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,679
first thing your support team asks are

905
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,800
the longs

906
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
and if you don't have them it becomes

907
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
extremely difficult to pinpoint the

908
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,679
culprit so in my opinion good logging

909
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,560
techniques are under appreciated so some

910
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,560
of them could be like it's always better

911
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,960
to send locks to a remote monitoring

912
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,520
tool instead of using local logging you

913
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
should always recheck your logging

914
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,719
levels to make sure that you have enough

915
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,119
information to go back and check what

916
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,239
happened syncing ntp servers in logging

917
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,159
servers if you uh

918
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,839
if you have several of them is always a

919
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,760
good practice when you're install

920
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,520
installing application on your customer

921
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
and as well i would suggest to share

922
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,918
debugging tools with them so that you

923
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,040
always have some accountability

924
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,760
now i have taken the example of remote

925
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,440
taxes scenario right so uh let's take

926
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,280
an example uh

927
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,800
we have uh

928
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,079
a system which has any connect installed

929
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,599
in it now any connect is cisco's uh vpn

930
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,760
application now this is this holds true

931
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,000
for any vendors so

932
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,240
i'm not being biased here so what

933
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,480
happens is let's assume any connect is

934
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,640
installed on that machine it also has

935
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,359
secure endpoints for posturing and

936
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,560
thread detection and uh other things and

937
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
say the user also has the mfi

938
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
application installed on their phones

939
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
now um

940
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,680
let's assume everything uh went fine

941
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,119
right the workstation was able to

942
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,839
connect to vpn your pp firewall was

943
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,240
already integrated with the im server

944
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,800
which in return was integrated with the

945
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
mfa server and also your orchestration

946
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,839
tool which is securex in my example is

947
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,320
also integrated with your firewall

948
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,560
but what if there was some malicious

949
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,119
traffic on the machine after some point

950
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,520
so what happens is uh since you're

951
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,240
monitoring your uh traffic through your

952
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,880
firewall and orchestration an ips alert

953
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,119
gets generated to the firewall which in

954
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,480
return triggers an sse event to your uh

955
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,839
orchestrator

956
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,960
and that in return triggers a workflow

957
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
now in this scenario the first thing

958
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
that you should think about is

959
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
terminating the vpn

960
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,720
the reason being you don't want any more

961
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,359
malicious traffic to come inside your

962
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,359
network to the peers wherever so the one

963
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,680
the first step should be to send a coa

964
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
to your im server to terminate that vpn

965
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
and after that what you can say that

966
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,000
to the mfa server you can trigger uh

967
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,640
an sse to say that block this user we

968
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
don't want this user connecting again

969
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,119
and also alert our users just as a user

970
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,880
experience that they won't be able to

971
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,920
connect anymore so once we have

972
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,760
terminated all sort of sessions and we

973
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
have enough information what we can do

974
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,400
is we can start an isolation of the

975
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,880
endpoint meaning that we can create ioc

976
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
so that we can do uh threat analysis

977
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
which is a very important part to know

978
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,000
uh in future if such kind of attacks

979
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,800
happen uh what are we going to do

980
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,640
now

981
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
one of the many interesting things that

982
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,800
happened in the recent elections was

983
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
that under the new presidency there has

984
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,680
been an executive order shared in public

985
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,000
which shared with public to encourage

986
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
zero trust architecture to be

987
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,240
implemented uh the key points talk about

988
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,960
federal bodies uh that uh themselves

989
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,040
would be migrating to adapt uh ztx

990
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,800
principles in the best interest of data

991
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,119
security uh we are more likely to see

992
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,720
security as a service to be available

993
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,480
for businesses including government

994
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,520
holdings

995
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,839
and company with data breaches will no

996
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,599
longer be allowed to keep the records to

997
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,680
themselves and this is a huge issue

998
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,160
before because the books get tossed

999
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
quickly to avoid or rather deny data

1000
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,880
breach news and we see that very often

1001
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,280
companies denying claims uh that their

1002
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
data was leaked

1003
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,119
you know so to avoid public code

1004
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
the white people should be in the chat

1005
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,800
for anyone who wants to go through the

1006
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,960
whole thing otherwise i'll put it at the

1007
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,320
end

1008
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,839
so uh

1009
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,680
now based on cyber security mesh

1010
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
implementation and everything we have

1011
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,000
discussed so far gartner has predicted

1012
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
how security is going to look in the

1013
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
next four to five years now we we only

1014
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,920
gonna assume that uh these would be the

1015
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
case but since most importance you know

1016
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,560
more importance is given to zero trust

1017
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,920
these are likely to happen im servers uh

1018
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
services will definitely increase we can

1019
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,680
accept expect a huge influx of requests

1020
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,760
going through them as opposed to how

1021
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,839
current authentication requests go

1022
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,680
locally on standalone authentication

1023
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,160
servers like active directories uh

1024
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,720
demographic bias uh would automatically

1025
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
decrease once the network becomes

1026
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
perimeter less or broken into small

1027
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,640
micro perimeters or segments

1028
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,440
now remember when i was discussing kazee

1029
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,240
attacks i mentioned the msps right

1030
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,560
therefore we need the z ztx in the

1031
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
coming years because these msps are very

1032
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
likely to increase which directly means

1033
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,599
that they will be more vulnerable

1034
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,240
so uh being allegedly the most important

1035
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
species and i say that because i believe

1036
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,480
dolphins are better we don't hesitate to

1037
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
overcomplicate things and zero trust is

1038
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
no stranger to that

1039
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
so some of the hiccups that we observe

1040
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,400
are listed here for example one of the

1041
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,640
key networking changes inhibitory do not

1042
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,320
support uh zero trust uh now if you

1043
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,240
migrate directly from on premise to

1044
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
cloud infrastructure the zero trust

1045
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,720
principles get violated they only work

1046
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
if you create applications based on zero

1047
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,280
trust separately

1048
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,760
also by incorporating old into new you

1049
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,079
risk contaminating things and enlarging

1050
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,320
the scope of the problem now of course

1051
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,160
these applications can and should be

1052
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,960
replaced but that brings new cost to the

1053
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
company that they were avoiding in the

1054
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,920
first place

1055
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,760
also some technologies in specific

1056
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,359
vendors which are widely used are hard

1057
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,000
coded to buy load violate zero trust for

1058
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,680
example peer-to-peer networking

1059
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,359
technology in windows is a default

1060
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,760
setting which states to share windows

1061
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
updates among peers to save internet

1062
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,800
bandwidth

1063
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,720
although this can be switched off many

1064
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
of the organizations and admins are not

1065
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,440
even aware that this exists so imagine a

1066
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,280
lateral movement from an attack vector

1067
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
hitting this or while it was enabled uh

1068
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,720
might as well have happened but i'm not

1069
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,119
aware of it so it's very unlikely that

1070
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,880
vendors like microsoft are going to

1071
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,280
remove these features on just an

1072
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,359
organization's request to run zero trust

1073
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,119
in their network

1074
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,040
so if you are set on doing things

1075
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
differently ensure you understand the

1076
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,680
technologies you're going to deploy and

1077
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,920
what controls will effectively mitigate

1078
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,520
the changes

1079
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
so to recap what we discussed in the

1080
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
session one of the best ways to

1081
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,319
implement the request is grill the

1082
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,319
endpoint if it puts up the fight don't

1083
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,640
take it for granted give it give it

1084
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,400
least possible privilege and don't

1085
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,760
forget about it

1086
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,280
with a change in network landscape

1087
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,760
understand your network your users and

1088
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,160
your resources understand the technology

1089
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
build dynamic rules and implement what

1090
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,440
suits you

1091
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
and not what suits the attackers

1092
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,160
obviously threats will never stop coming

1093
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,119
and no company can sell you a box and

1094
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,119
say there you go you're all good you

1095
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,359
have implemented zero trust security i

1096
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,200
mean i wish it did but

1097
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,000
that is just doesn't work like that

1098
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
so after i have ranted so much about

1099
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
what's wrong with the current practices

1100
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,079
right there's something for everyone

1101
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,800
that can help us be less attack pro

1102
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,880
security is a collaborative tool it's

1103
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,200
not a product so more people the more

1104
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
people are trained are scrutinized on

1105
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
the responses the more robust the

1106
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,839
network or the organization becomes so

1107
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,680
please take your data compliance check

1108
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,760
in seriously because every organization

1109
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,440
has a different way of dealing incidents

1110
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,599
responses so this gives you an idea

1111
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,440
about what to do if you have anything to

1112
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,240
share

1113
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,160
with that if you see any suspicious

1114
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
activity when you're just about to log

1115
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,520
off from your friday night shift don't

1116
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,880
wait till monday

1117
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,560
it takes just the same amount of time

1118
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,400
for attackers to take advantage of that

1119
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,640
ignorance so report any malicious

1120
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,760
activity activity when in doubt uh as

1121
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
soon as possible

1122
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,040
one more thing we have forgotten uh

1123
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,599
that we use is the fact of not scanning

1124
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,160
our emails the stats still remain the

1125
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,839
same that the biggest attacks are via

1126
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,920
efficient so unnecessary email

1127
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,400
attachments and links are biggest causes

1128
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,280
for

1129
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,800
attack vendors

1130
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,200
i think we uh there are organizations

1131
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,040
that use collaborative tools like share

1132
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,480
points which can reduce the attack

1133
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,880
surface so something to ponder do we

1134
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,079
really need emails to contain links or

1135
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,520
attachments

1136
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,640
also

1137
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,240
take your backups don't take them uh per

1138
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,800
month or so they should be minimum at

1139
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
hourly basis

1140
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,880
and if you're moving to a different team

1141
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,640
it's always a good practice to give away

1142
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,200
your previous applications and

1143
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,920
privileges this this not only increases

1144
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,960
data security it can reduce data wastage

1145
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,560
to a great extent

1146
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,440
and one important thing is white listing

1147
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,280
uh which means sharing information

1148
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,440
within organization which is from a

1149
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,240
trusted source in my opinion blacklist

1150
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,720
does not work anymore because uh for

1151
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,359
example you browse an ad on a secure

1152
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,520
site which has nothing harmful in it

1153
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,839
through the whole page the ad itself is

1154
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,319
also not about any malicious content and

1155
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,319
neither is the site but the problem is

1156
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,880
that the ad agency even doesn't know

1157
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,599
what kind of ads are being posted so it

1158
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,760
is very unmonitored space where you

1159
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,400
can't blame the attacker or the site so

1160
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,160
this is the whole process itself that

1161
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,040
can easily be malvertized uh which often

1162
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,920
happens uh and honestly no one would be

1163
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,680
thinking of black listing hundreds and

1164
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,920
thousands of ads right now right so go

1165
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,200
for white listing instead of

1166
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,960
blacklisting

1167
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,960
now i've come to the end of my

1168
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,160
presentation so i have a small quiz for

1169
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,720
you guys so if you guys can head over to

1170
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,560
the quiz um that'll be great and uh the

1171
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,040
links for the quiz are also on the chat

1172
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,640
so i will

1173
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,040
share the quiz

1174

see people joining thanks kellyn for

1181
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,240
joining

1182
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
oh perfect we have more people joining

1183
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,200
thank you

1184
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,560
so yeah let's start

1185
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,520
so the secured the cloud services you

1186
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,240
are part of are giving you access to the

1187
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,040
applications you never use how well is

1188
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,319
the security management

1189
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
so yeah most of you guys uh

1190
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,839
did put up the right answer it's always

1191
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,440
a good practice to reach out to your

1192
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,839
security team if you are not aware what

1193
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,440
to do

1194
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,520
so the next question

1195
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,359
right after this session you receive an

1196
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,760
email ad from a vendor on your personal

1197
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,920
laptop about zero trust implementation

1198
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,240
and how it can fix everything what do

1199
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,680
you do

1200
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,200
so i'm actually gonna stop the request

1201
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,720
since we're running out of time so okay

1202
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,480
mark it as spam and report to email

1203
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,200
vendor that's a good practice because

1204
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,480
nowadays ai has evolved so much that we

1205
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,240
whatever you might be chatting on

1206
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
whatsapp with your friends

1207
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,800
that's the next ad you see on facebook

1208
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,079
so your data is not at all secure on uh

1209
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
social media platforms so

1210
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,640
getting a random email just after this

1211
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,520
talk is always suspicious

1212
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,040
uh so actually all of these are

1213
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,280
principles of zero trust

1214
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,319
um and always verify never trust whoever

1215
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,640
has answered uh that is one of the key

1216
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,799
points of zero trust principles

1217
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
now imagine you get alerts to change

1218
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,800
your login password but the reason

1219
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,240
mentioned is that you don't have

1220
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,720
authority to log into that application

1221
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,839
what do you do

1222
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,680
absolutely

1223
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,160
if anything is fishy your password if it

1224
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,399
doesn't make sense always report it

1225
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,680
so this is kind of a feedback of this

1226
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,400
session so

1227
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,240
and uh thank you guys uh so that was the

1228
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,200
aim of this uh quiz and one last thing

1229
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,079
is

1230
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,839
remember i asked you a question about

1231
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,079
uh you know paying some ransom so

1232
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,680
if you ever happen to be affected by

1233
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,520
ransomware will you pay the ransom to

1234
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,560
the attackers or not

1235
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,640
perfect so yes always consult a security

1236
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,480
organization when you need

1237
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,640
so

1238
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,920
