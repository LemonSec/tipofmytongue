00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
really excited to talk to you about the

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
imposter syndrome a topic that's really

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,759
close to my heart

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
and thank you diana initiative for

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
making it possible

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
and all the sponsors for creating this

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
opportunity for me here today

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
so i was told security people love cat

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
pictures so i figured since it's my

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
first talk at a security conference i

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,479
should start with a cat picture and make

47
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,280
a good impression

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
so let me start with a little scenario

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
that i've experienced as a woman in

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
security so you walk into a meeting

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,400
there's a bunch of guys who already seem

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
to know each other

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
they're making personal jokes that you

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
don't understand and then the meeting

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
starts you start taking notes and then

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
they start throwing out acronyms and

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
jargon

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
and as the meeting progresses your

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
mental chatter kicks in and then you

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
start feeling smaller and smaller and

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
then you feel like oh maybe they're so

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,120
smart what am i doing here does anyone

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
relate to this feeling and if you do

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
post your favorite emoji in the chat

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
right

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,839
i'm sure there's a lot of us

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
okay

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
well congratulations you are in the

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,279
right talk

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
so let me start a little bit with

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
telling you about myself

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
so my name is charu bansal i grew up in

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
a small town in rural himalayas

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
and i had very little access to

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,440
technology as i grew up with no real

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
role models i studied liberal arts

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
mostly because i didn't know what i

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
wanted to do

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
and then i got a job and then seven

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,840
years ago somebody took a chance on me

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,920
in their security team and that was my

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,120
pivot into security and i finally found

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
something that i loved enjoyed loved

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
doing and now after

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
many years of hard work and overcoming a

86
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,599
lot of imposter syndrome feelings iweck

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,080
is an information security officer for a

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
global enterprise

89
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
and i'm grateful to a lot of people

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
who've believed in me along these

91
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
through this journey and supported me

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
and some of them are actually in the

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,679
audience today

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
so my first year in security was

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
actually really fun i learned that

96
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
a penetration test was actually a

97
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,200
security assessment

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
and then there was always a man in the

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,159
middle

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,480
and burp suite was not what it sounded

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,319
like thank god

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,400
who came up with all of this

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
and it all became clear when i went to

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,798
my first security conference

105
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,479
i was one of five women at a 200 person

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,520
event

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
it was great that i didn't have to queue

108
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
for the bathroom but surely there was a

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
problem

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
it was no surprise that i struggled to

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
fit in

112
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
i constantly grappled with the question

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,000
what value can i bring to security

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,639
maybe i should go back to university or

115
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,199
maybe i've joined the party too late

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
everyone's so smart

117
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,360
so that was what was going on in my head

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
all the time

119
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
and then i had a realization i thought i

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
was brave for doing this not only was i

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
challenging my own insecurities but i

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
was also challenging an established bias

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
against women in technology so we are up

124
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
against a lot

125
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,759
and it's bound to be hard so i gave

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,080
myself a pat on my back and

127
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,639
and i tell myself every time i struggle

128
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,400
that hey you pray for doing this

129
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
so one of the best lessons i want to

130
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
share with you today is that knowledge

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
is not equal to intelligence

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
so just because you haven't heard of a

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,440
certain acronym or you haven't come

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
across a certain technology

135
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,800
does not mean that you cannot learn it

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
knowledge and intelligence are two

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,080
different things

138
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
you are intelligent and you can learn

139
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
anything that you're willing to put the

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
effort in

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
the key is putting in that continuous

142
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,280
effort

143
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,759
to learn and grow there are multiple

144
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,919
resources that are available and that

145
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,440
can be leveraged

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
some of the best security professionals

147
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,080
i know are self-taught and they continue

148
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
to learn

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
so challenge yourself to learn something

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
new every day

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,759
listen to security podcasts subscribe to

152
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
newsletters go to your local security

153
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
community events attend conferences and

154
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,840
webinars

155
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
don't let others define your boundaries

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
so this was kind of um interesting that

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
i experienced people would tell me

158
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
oh maybe you can just take notes or

159
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
maybe you'll not be able to lead that

160
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,600
meeting with the engineers or they would

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,240
say you are so great at organizing

162
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
things maybe you can take care of all

163
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,039
our conflict pages and we can do all the

164
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,720
tech details

165
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
people love putting you in boxes because

166
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
they believe they know you and sometimes

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
they actually believe they're helping

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,639
you

169
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
but if you don't challenge that

170
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,919
narrative that box becomes your reality

171
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,680
so challenge people

172
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
when they say when they put you in a box

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,240
and surprise them by making your own

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,039
path and then doing a kick-ass job

175
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
threat modeling as we know is a

176
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
collaborative exercise when teams come

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
together to identify and proactively

178
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,440
mitigate potential threats to a system

179
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
process

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
or application

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
having a diverse team

182
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
in that perspective is immensely

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
valuable to this process

184
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
so every time i moved continents i would

185
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
make a list of all the things that could

186
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
possibly go wrong

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
and then i would find ways to

188
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
proactively fix it

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
i just didn't know it was threat

190
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
modelling

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599
so my knowledge of various payment

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
methods and potential threat factors was

193
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
actually really invaluable when we were

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
building a threat model for a global

195
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,000
payment platform at work i knew global

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,160
law laws and regulations really well

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
which was helpful

198
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
in incident response planning and i

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
understood how people in different

200
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,160
cultures behave and react which helped

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
me design creative fishing exercises

202
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,960
i also had great analytical skills

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
security is an understanding of human

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
behavior and not all security problems

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
have technical solutions

206
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
nor does security only have technical

207
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,400
problems

208
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
so find the unique skills that you have

209
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
built from your life experiences that

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,919
will broaden the perspective of your

211
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,960
team

212
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
don't limit yourself by what you what's

213
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
already out there but create your own

214
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
threat model

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,000
and bring your own value you will amaze

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
yourself

217
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
and some days it's going to be hard and

218
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
you will struggle and when that happens

219
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
ask for help

220
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
it can be a colleague that you trust or

221
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,080
somebody that you met at a conference

222
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
and this is something i didn't do

223
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
early on because i was afraid and that

224
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
is characteristic of the imposter

225
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,640
syndrome because you don't want people

226
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
to find out that you're struggling

227
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
only when i realized that everyone

228
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
around me was actually also doing the

229
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
same thing

230
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
so as a security community

231
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
i think we need to normalize asking for

232
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
help

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
when we are struggling and it can start

234
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
with you

235
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
so don't brush your struggles under the

236
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
carpet we've all been there and we can

237
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,600
help each other out

238
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
so now you may think okay

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
i can challenge my deal with my own

240
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
mental chatter but what about others

241
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,640
has anybody ever experienced rolling of

242
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
eyes or frustration or impatience when

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,279
you've asked a question

244
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,200
so post an emoji in the chat if you've

245
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
experienced that

246
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
i love it

247
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
well that's bound to happen and when

248
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
that happens

249
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
be prepared show up and be present

250
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
ask for an agenda

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,399
chances are

252
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
there is no agenda that's happened with

253
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
me a lot of times and if but you be that

254
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
person who asks for it and if there is

255
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,360
anything unfamiliar in the agenda

256
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
prepare study about it and show up to

257
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,240
the meeting with already having a

258
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600
perspective

259
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,399
and then show up and show up again

260
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
don't be detained if somebody rolls

261
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,320
their eyes at you or

262
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,720
raises their eyebrows

263
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
and be present listen intently

264
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,560
sometimes you may only understand ten

265
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
percent of the discussion and that's

266
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
okay

267
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
if you keep showing up and you keep

268
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,399
engaging things will start to connect

269
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
and the one thing i cannot stress enough

270
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240
is to find a mentor you can trust

271
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
a role model and someone who can guide

272
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
you in your career aspirations

273
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
i've met some incredible people at

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
conferences like the diana initiative

275
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
who are always willing to help

276
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,480
just as a recent example when i first

277
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
applied to the cfp at the diana

278
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,440
initiative it was not selected but i was

279
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040
given the option to work the mentor

280
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
and she really helped me and it was an

281
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
incredible experience to help me think

282
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,279
through my message help me think through

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,680
what i really wanted to convey and i

284
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
applied again and here i am

285
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,399
so it's really amazing what a mentor can

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,959
do for you

287
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
and i'm going to pivot a little bit in

288
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
my talk here and i'm gonna talk to the

289
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
mentors in the audience today people who

290
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
are either mentoring others or planning

291
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,480
to

292
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
are there any mentors today

293
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
all right

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
well thank you for being a mentor so

295
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
over the last seven years of working in

296
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
security many people have offered

297
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
support and sometimes with the best of

298
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,959
intentions

299
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
but the most helpful mentors have been

300
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
those who have invested the time to

301
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
dialogue

302
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
to ask questions and understand where

303
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,639
i'm coming from

304
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,320
i know a lot a lot of people have said

305
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
to me oh if you need anything just reach

306
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,839
out

307
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
but the problem is sometimes we don't

308
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
know what we need

309
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
and sometimes it's very difficult to ask

310
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
for help

311
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,160
mentoring in that sense is a process of

312
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,720
dialogue to help understand what the

313
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,519
person needs from us it is a process of

314
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,959
building trust

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
and you need to help people

316
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,079
have trust in you

317
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
so i have a funny story

318
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
my partner also works in security and

319
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
he's quite technical so many years ago

320
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
when we first started going out

321
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,600
um

322
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
we were at lunch and they were making

323
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
some linux jokes and i didn't get that

324
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
and i said well i think i really want to

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
learn linux and then my partner's like

326
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,600
sure i'll help you out

327
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
and next thing i know i got this book in

328
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,000
the mail and i was looking at it like

329
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
okay

330
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,480
what i really needed was this not a

331
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
liberal arts background i had no clue

332
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
if only he had asked me what i know

333
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
about linux and i would have said

334
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
nothing and then he would have known

335
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,079
what to get me

336
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
a common tendency for mentors or

337
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
supporters is also

338
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
when they see someone struggling they

339
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,519
offer to do it for them

340
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,040
people will say don't worry about the

341
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
diagram i'll do it for you or bring me

342
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,959
on to the meeting and i can take care of

343
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,040
all the tech details

344
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
don't don't fix it for them offer to

345
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
teach it it may take a little longer but

346
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,839
it will really help them

347
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,360
i remember a few years ago i reached out

348
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
to somebody on my team and asked if they

349
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
could help me understand how a sql

350
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
injection worked

351
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
and i got a very enthusiastic email back

352
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,760
with 10 youtube links to conferences

353
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,199
they had been through links to

354
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,560
pluralsight and library courses links to

355
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,639
books on amazon that i could buy and

356
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,000
then finally

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,279
there was their own research on github

358
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
and i remember reading that email and

359
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
feeling even worse than i did before

360
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,160
because i thought there's no way i can

361
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
ever learn this this is way too hard

362
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,959
so it really goes back to our discussion

363
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
on when dialogue we really need to help

364
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,000
people with very targeted resources

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
is it the technology they don't

366
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,360
understand or is it that they're not

367
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
able to make connections and once you

368
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
know what they really need just offer

369
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,439
them only that resource

370
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,199
and be patient with your mentees it may

371
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,920
take time to understand sometimes it can

372
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,720
be frustrating but it's a very rewarding

373
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
process in the end i've found

374
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
that being a mentor to others is

375
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
actually very helpful in dealing with

376
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
your own imposter syndrome

377
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
it makes me think that if i can help

378
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,600
somebody

379
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
maybe i know a thing or two

380
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,000
and

381
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
finally i told you there's going to be

382
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,399
more cat pictures

383
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
there is a message for anyone who's

384
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
looking to change careers into

385
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
information security or anyone who feels

386
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
insecure with their background

387
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
you can bring valuable and unique

388
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,160
contributions to the world of security

389
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
so don't doubt yourself if you don't

390
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
have a technical background or you are

391
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,600
surrounded by seemingly smart people

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
speaking at my first security conference

393
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,120
brought up a ton of imposter syndrome

394
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,399
feelings

395
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,480
but a huge shout out to the diana

396
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,399

so i'm looking in the chat

410
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,519

411
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,199
might like to reach out right now

412
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
and i'm also going to post

413
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,519
here is the survey link

414
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
so please remember to go and fill out

415
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
the speaker survey um fortu this is

416
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
um just an awesome thing and we really

417
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,759
want to know how well

418
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,160
uh our speakers and all the talks were

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,120
were received by everyone so please take

420
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
a few moments to actually do that

421
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,560
and i'm looking do we have any

422
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,680
any questions in there

423
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
there's one do you want to go ahead and

424
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,560
take that

425
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
probably told people when they willing

426
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
who may not be willing

427
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,520
yeah i think uh just the same thing you

428
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,760
have to dialogue and we have to help

429
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
them trust us because it's hard like i

430
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
think i struggled with just owning up to

431
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,400
it

432
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,799
and i think as a community we can

433
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,679
normalize that um asking for help and

434
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,240
asking saying that hey we're struggling

435
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,919
i think a lot of times people just don't

436
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
do that but the more and more we do it

437
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,640
um we can really help people open up and

438
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,720
share that they are struggling

439
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
and i think that just creates that whole

440
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,000
environment where people can um feel

441
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
open to share whatever they feel

442
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
i i'm going to go ahead and throw out a

443
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,360
question myself um i i've been doing

444
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
this for

445
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
a very long time more than 30 years um

446
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,600
and yet i still get imposter syndrome i

447
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
just maybe a couple weeks ago i woke up

448
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,360
and i went

449
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,719
i have no idea what i'm doing

450
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,240
and

451
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,600
i why is that why no matter how long

452
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,080
we've been doing something why do we

453
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,799
still get this

454
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,120
that's why my talk was called navigating

455
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
the imposter syndrome and not overcoming

456
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
the impostor syndrome because yes that

457
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
just continues

458
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
and uh yeah i still struggle with it a

459
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
lot of times i'm still in meetings and

460
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
i'm just like i don't know and even this

461
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,039
morning when i had to do this

462
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,400
presentation

463
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
i was just having a serious struggle

464
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
like why would people want to listen to

465
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
me

466
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
what do i have to offer but that's

467
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
unfortunately that's

468
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
that's how it is but we can all i think

469
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
as a community when we support each

470
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,640
other and we see that

471
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
everyone struggles with it it's just not

472
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
us

473
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
i think that's quite comforting

474
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
and uh and the more and more we do it

475
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
and the more and more we challenge

476
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,919
ourselves i think it becomes easier

477
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
is is there a term for those times when

478
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,480
you

479
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,200
um do something and you actually say to

480
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
yourself damn i'm good at what i do

481
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
because it's the total opposite of the

482
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
impostor syndrome

483
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
exactly and that happens right a lot of

484
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
times i i was uh when i started working

485
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
in security it was like i started from

486
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
like the basics and

487
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
it was like not knowing anything and now

488
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
when i can just sit in a meeting

489
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,120
sometimes i'll throw out some acronyms

490
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,799
and people will just look at me like

491
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,280
okay she knows a thing or two and

492
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,080
i feel good about it

493
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,360
it's uh yeah it's it's a process and uh

494
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
unfortunately

495
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
um there will always be some people who

496
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
will um

497
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,440
roll their eyes or be frustrated um but

498
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,160
you

499
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,919
but you can there's always also a great

500
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,880
community of supporters out there

501
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
awesome

502
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,880
uh

503
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,720
let's see any other questions

504
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
i

505
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,120
don't see oh there we go

506
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
oh are there any clicks

507
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
yeah i think what i tell myself is what

508
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,840
i shared my first slide was i am brave

509
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
for doing this that that's what i every

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,919
time there is a thought that comes in i

511
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
challenge it how true is it

512
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
and then i say

513
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,400
hey you're brave it's not you came from

514
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
nothing and you are here doing this a

515
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,400
lot of people are not

516
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,799
so pat yourself with the back and be

517
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,480
proud of what you're doing and that

518
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,200
usually helps me in the moment

519
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,120
to challenge whatever is going on

520
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,039
it it was actually very apropos in

521
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
alyssa's um keynote this morning that

522
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
she mentioned that the imposter syndrome

523
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,520
talk was coming up and she had put up

524
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,720
the tweet that she almost sent about

525
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
being very very very negative

526
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
um and you know even someone like her

527
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
having those feelings at least it

528
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,760
justifies the fact that when we feel it

529
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,720
okay

530
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,840
you know we're allowed i

531
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,640
guess i see another question um yeah i

532
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
think the compliments it's

533
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
it's hard sometimes but you gotta own it

534
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,240
and i think

535
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,280
we should complement each other more

536
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,840
um we don't do that enough i think and

537
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
and uh and today just just hearing from

538
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
