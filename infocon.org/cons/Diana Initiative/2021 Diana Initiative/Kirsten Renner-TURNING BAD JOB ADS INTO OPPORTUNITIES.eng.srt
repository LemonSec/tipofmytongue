nature

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,879

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
best asset i'll be

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,599
um saying almost the same thing i call

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
it your own best advocate

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,800
and and that will come up here in a sec

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
so who am i um bri mentioned

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
what i what i do in the community i

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
also for for a paycheck and the director

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
of recruiting

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
at a company called nevada an advanced

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,239
analytics and

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,239
full spectrum uh cyber products and

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
services firm

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
i'm a college dropout that comes that

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
comes into the story later

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,159
it becomes relevant to what we're going

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,760
to talk about today

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,280
um and i also mentioned here that i did

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,799
a little bit of programming

98
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,319
and a little bit of it and that now and

99
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,440
for the last

100
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,519
well over a decade have been recruiting

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,440
so again that becomes relevant again

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,319
also in our discussion specifically with

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
regard to

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
um qualifications in who we are and

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
where we are

106
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,280
in our journeys and uh how that relates

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
to job ads

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
so these are a sample of some of my

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
prior speaking engagement

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,439
as well and you can find me on

111
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,760
twitter as uh krenner which a lot of

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
people just think that's my name and

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
refer to me as that so

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
if you can't pronounce pronounced carson

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,080
just call me krenner

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,760
and i'll reply so now what um

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,879
so all of our perspectives are different

118
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,760
and we're all in different stages of our

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,120
careers

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
our backgrounds brought us to where we

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
are and who we are

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,520
and we're all in different spots i i

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
actually

124
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
have recorded this talk now twice

125
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,520
for two other conferences and i'm

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
recording it again monday

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,639
but this is my first opportunity to

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,960
to give the talk live and so

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
um i'm really looking forward to

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
engaging and i'm really looking forward

131
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,880
to this is this is close to on a stage

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,840
i've been

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
uh in the last 18 months um

134
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
and i'm going to go off script for a

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,440
brief moment here and

136
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,199
it's because last night i was thinking i

137
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
was thinking about

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,320
um why this message is

139
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
important for anybody who faces

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,080
challenges based on

141
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
um what whatever it may be whatever your

142
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
perspective is whatever

143
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,600
your um wherever you're coming from and

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
i thought about

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
i wonder how i got to this place

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
personally um

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,919
so we don't all know what each other's

148
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,440
exact

149
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
circumstances are or perspectives are

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,199
right um

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
um i've never been uh trans i've never

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,840
been a person of

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
color i've never been a person with a

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,680
visible

155
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
disability for example so

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,400
we're all coming from a different place

157
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,919
where do i come from um i'm a woman

158
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,800
i've been a single mom i know what it's

159
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
like to be

160
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,039
raised by someone with mental illness i

161
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,479
know what it's like to be in an abusive

162
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,600
marriage

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,080
i know what it's like to wake up from a

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,120
coma

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,759
and have to learn to walk and talk again

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
and then to

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
look in the mirror one day uh after

168
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
fighting to get back custody of my kid

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
this all is gonna make sense here in a

170
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,919
second

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,359
um and

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,440
and say to myself i don't have education

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
i have no formal education i didn't go

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,639
to college

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
i have no experience

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,039
i have no formal training so

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
at that point every job description

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,199
is not a fit for me so how did i get to

179
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,639
all those places i told you about on the

180
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,840
last slide

181
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,880
um something clicked

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,680
there was a switch i clicked the switch

183
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,160
uh

184
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
and i'm gonna hopefully say something

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
today to

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
inspire anybody to do just that

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
so

188
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,720
as we go from these different places

189
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,319
these different challenges

190
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
i i mentioned that i was briefly uh in

191
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,440
programming how did i do that i was

192
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
at a temporary part-time front desk

193
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,880
job it was gov sec contract

194
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
software developments back in the 90s

195
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
they called it programming

196
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,240
and i just started reading a book for

197
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
those of you that don't know

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
it's uh the younger crowd it's a paper

199
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
thing there's pages you read it

200
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,319
taught myself how to program so yes

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,280
middle-aged

202
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,400
white dude vp guy who just

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,319
recently said do you actually know how

204
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,240
to program yeah i do i do because i read

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
it in a book

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
right and so what is my point not cooler

207
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
i'm not smarter

208
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479
i'm not stronger i just flipped a switch

209
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
you all have that switch too so half of

210
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,639
you

211
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
reported that you don't know how to find

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,639
a job that is what i believe dt put

213
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
on the career hacking uh village page

214
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
for defcon that's that's interesting

215
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
i will get to a survey here in a minute

216
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
where you all half of you told me

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
if you see a job ad that sucks which

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,759
again it's most of them like alyssa said

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,560
right

220
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
um you just walk away from it you just

221
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
chose to not

222
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,280
take those opportunities so we'll get to

223
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
that in a second here too and again

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,319
statistically i don't have all the

225
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
statistics but i do know that women and

226
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,879
people of color

227
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,639
are statistically less likely to apply

228
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,000
for a job they don't feel like they're a

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
match for so let's talk about what to do

230
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
about that

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,599
do i think in all my years of experience

232
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
i'm pretty old

233
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,559
do i think that we can

234
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,440
make the employers get it right all of

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,000
them

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
no we'll keep trying but they won't

237
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
so better to arm and enable ourselves

238
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
like i said in the last keynote she said

239
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
that you're your best asset you're also

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
your best advocate

241
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
so let's figure out how to turn all

242
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,279
those crappy job descriptions

243
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,200
and job ads into opportunities for

244
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
ourselves so here's the agenda

245
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
that's me um

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
look at it sort of like an engineering

247
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,279
challenge

248
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,240
right so when you go to your

249
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
stakeholders and when you go to your

250
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,800
customers

251
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
and you talk to them about their

252
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
problems or what they're

253
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
asking you to provide a solution for

254
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,760
what do you do

255
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
you start building the requirements

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
right you start ranking them you start

257
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,040
defining them you start

258
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,519
looking around at uh sorting them what's

259
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,880
important you're going to run into

260
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
challenges and blockers and you can

261
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,760
provide solutions to those as well this

262
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,000
is

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
just like that then you will find the

264
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,519
avenues to

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,680
connecting which is is the solution

266
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,360
and uh and then you get to the next

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
level and do effective interviewing so

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
you start the job ad even the bad one

269
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
and you go from there

270
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,240
so we figured out okay

271
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
at least we can assume

272
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,640
uh that the job ad is indicative of what

273
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
they're probably hiring so what are you

274
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
gonna do with that here's your first

275
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
assignment

276
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
and this won't take a long time and this

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,079
isn't hard

278
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,760
okay abc company is hiring probably

279
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
because they posted this job i want you

280
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
to start

281
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,079
on linkedin i want you to look at the

282
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,519
company page now

283
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,399
i'm not super concerned about what they

284
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,240
say about themselves there

285
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
because they say whatever they want you

286
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,440
to

287
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,399
think so let's let's do something else

288
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,519
let's look at what else they're

289
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
advertising

290
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
that's going to tell you either what

291
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
type of work they do

292
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
or what type of work they want to do

293
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
or are trying to do or trying to win

294
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
work to do

295
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
so that's that's telling you one thing

296
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
about the company then i want you to

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
look at the people so linkedin will sell

298
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
you when you put abc company in your

299
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
search

300
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
you can say what it'll ask you what do

301
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,040
you want to look for

302
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,240
the jobs or the people i want you to

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,200
look at the people

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
particularly the ones that are either

305
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
doing the job that you saw let's just

306
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,160
make up a job

307
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
intel analyst that's what you want to do

308
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
or that's the job post that you saw

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,519
look for the other intel analysts at abc

310
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,800
company

311
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,920
let's take a look real quick at what

312
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
their

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,120
progression within their careers looks

314
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,079
like

315
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
what education did they have how did

316
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,600
they get there

317
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
are there any intel analysts without

318
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
degrees because let's pretend you're me

319
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,920
and you don't have one

320
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
cool well it looks like at this company

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,839
i can get there without that

322
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,920
right that's what you just figured out

323
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
did they move up within the company or

324
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
did they have to move between

325
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
companies to get where they are today

326
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
so look for who's doing what you want to

327
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
do

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
and let's try to figure out how they got

329
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
there and whether or not the company

330
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
that they're in that's advertising

331
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
is a good place for you to get there

332
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
so i sort of redacted you can actually

333
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
you can actually see you can see it but

334
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,079
um

335
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
if i didn't ask for permission i i

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
redacted and

337
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
um alyssa gave me permission plus who

338
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
doesn't want to see her beautiful face

339
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,200
so

340
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
um here's a couple different things

341
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
you're talking about and i did all this

342
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,680
in one day by the way

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
this is a daily thing i don't know if

344
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
it's just an algorithm for my feed

345
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
but i see people complaining every day

346
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
about job descriptions some that are

347
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,839
completely nonsensical

348
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
some that are very unreasonable

349
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,160
and the rare gems this might be the only

350
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
time i ever saw somebody say that one

351
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,959
was good

352
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,839
but but that's nice of her to do that

353
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
um

354
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
so also i get what's happening here

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
i get that people are saying hey if you

356
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
use a term in your job ad like fast pace

357
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,360
it really means you want me to do three

358
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
jobs so just ask yourself if that's what

359
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
you want to do

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,760
right that sort of thing is interesting

361
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,639
to me

362
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,800
um i don't want to just get pigeonholed

363
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,959
or i'm at a place where

364
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,320
i've kind of always been in a place

365
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,120
where i'm going to get bored easily

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
if i'm not doing a bunch of things so if

367
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
i'm not having a lot of things on my

368
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
to-do list

369
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
i'm going to go create new ones so this

370
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
is still going to be

371
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
giving you the information that you're

372
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
looking for that you need

373
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
um self-starter maybe they weren't

374
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,839
trying to trick you into saying

375
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,120
by the way we're never going to train

376
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
you we're never going to give you any

377
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,200
resources

378
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
we will be fair for a millisecond

379
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,720
to say that not every company

380
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,320
has the same resources

381
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
or in some cases uh timing and by timing

382
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
i mean if the

383
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
need is immediate if the customer has a

384
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
customer has an immediate need they may

385
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
not have the time that it takes to do an

386
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,360
irad or a training program or

387
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,199
an internship program or a fellowship

388
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,040
program but bravo to the companies that

389
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,480
do that so be looking for those things

390
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,040
as well

391
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760
take note of that those are the types of

392
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,480
companies that

393
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
invest in their people

394
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
so again i asked you all

395
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,440
there wasn't now i can't remember the

396
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,320
amount of

397
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,279
people it takes for a survey to actually

398
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,959
become data this is nowhere near that

399
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,720
amount of people i don't have that many

400
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,800
followers but

401
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,519
again half of you are saying i skip it i

402
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,360
ignore it if it's horrible

403
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
so i have a mini disclaimer well

404
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,839
too many disclaimers i hear you because

405
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,680
i've heard you before

406
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
and because i can read your minds

407
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
actually

408
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,639
um i hear you saying yeah they sometimes

409
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,639
they write job descriptions just for the

410
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,079
just for one person

411
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
they have one person that they want or

412
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,120
they have a tiny group of people that

413
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,399
they want

414
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
um i have two little examples is it true

415
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,839
yes it's true have i ever done it yes

416
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
at my current job no um actually

417
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,399
the one time i did it was 12 years ago

418
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,279
maybe um if i told you the tool you'd

419
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,040
know who the people were

420
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
uh what i'll do is i'll say and i'm not

421
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,839
going to tell you because i might have

422
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,959
hiring in them but

423
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,000
some of them what i will tell you

424
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,360
is that the customer had a specific

425
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,920
problem

426
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,480
that only a specific tool could solve

427
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
fair

428
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,240
okay so they wanted they took it a step

429
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,880
further

430
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,800
a lot of people that wrote the tool okay

431
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
that's a small handful of people

432
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,560
so what can we do about that

433
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
and the way that i when i was recording

434
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
the defcon career village talk um

435
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
kathleen we all know her we all love her

436
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
she was the moderator she was recording

437
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
it with me

438
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
so i saw her face and it occurred to me

439
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,759
that she was the perfect example and

440
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,800
here's why

441
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,600
what if i am the company owner and i

442
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,399
want

443
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
a kathleen i specifically want

444
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
someone who has done what she has done

445
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
that we can all it's pretty fair to say

446
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
that

447
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,839
she's almost the only one if not the

448
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,360
only one that has done certain things in

449
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
our community

450
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
so if the job description says you

451
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,000
planned this and you started this and

452
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
you founded this and you were the

453
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
champion of this and

454
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
okay well only she can do that only she

455
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
has done that but can only she

456
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,759
do that not necessarily right

457
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,839
uh can someone else learn to do it can

458
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,959
someone else

459
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,480
give examples of things that they've

460
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,160
done that are similar well i

461
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,040
well i didn't start

462
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
mock interviews villages and i didn't

463
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
get

464
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
conferences to adopt that and start

465
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,720
doing that

466
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
but i started a

467
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,320
training program in a school or you get

468
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
what i'm trying to say

469
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,920
right so this and when you identify

470
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
these things in the job description i'm

471
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
about to tell you

472
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,880
how you can get through the layers the

473
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,920
layers being

474
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,639
the recruiter and the interview table

475
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,480
and this is where you are gonna already

476
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
have forward thought

477
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
all of these questions the things that

478
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,599
don't make sense in the description

479
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,039
and the things that don't necessarily

480
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
line up with exactly what you've done

481
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
because again if i only got the jobs

482
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
that didn't require degrees i

483
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,039
wouldn't have a job right y'all never

484
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,679
would have met me

485
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
so there i'm only gonna give these

486
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
things i actually regret these slides

487
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,559
when i when i

488
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,080
record this next time i won't do it um

489
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,200
there are some things that you should

490
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,039
just run away from i won't give them a

491
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,240
lot of attention i won't leave them up

492
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
there forever i know this is being

493
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,559
recorded but

494
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
if they're disgusting and let me tell

495
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
you have you been on social media lately

496
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,520
there's been a lot of remarkably weird

497
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
gross things lately

498
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,559
i don't know if people are trying to be

499
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,160
clever if they've been in their house

500
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
too long and they're bored i don't know

501
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
what's wrong with people but your clever

502
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
little surveys and your weird things

503
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
that you're saying

504
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
it's not funny it's not funny look at

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
number eight that's that's gross

506
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
if you see things like this run away you

507
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,679
can call them out for it if you want or

508
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,559
you could just

509
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,679
these are the ones i want you to run

510
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,720
away from so back to your requirements

511
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
remember that when you're looking at a

512
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
job description it's supposed

513
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
to be it's legally from a compliance

514
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
perspective supposed to be broken down

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,400
into requirements

516
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,840
that which is required that which is

517
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,200
preferred so i want you to do the same

518
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
thing when you're looking at your jobs

519
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
i want you to look at the company

520
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,039
remember you figured out a little bit

521
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,160
about the company you figured out about

522
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,679
the culture you figured out about what

523
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,400
the typical

524
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
path for other employees there seems to

525
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
be like

526
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
does that work for me for the things

527
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,880
that i need for the things that i

528
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,360
want for the things that i prefer do i

529
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
have deal breakers

530
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
are there certain things that certain

531
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
companies do that you're not interested

532
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,520
in being a part of

533
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
figure that out make a list i'm a list

534
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,799
person make a list

535
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
rank and proceed

536
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,720
i won't go through all of this i

537
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
actually know who wrote this

538
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
i know what they were trying to

539
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,679
accomplish

540
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,880
this is either an

541
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
exploit dev or an re or some combination

542
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,799
of that

543
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,559
um again i get what they were trying to

544
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,240
do so i'm going to go through

545
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,000
as let's pretend this is you you just

546
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
saw this you're interested

547
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
but you have questions what questions do

548
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,760
you have let's see

549
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,240
first of all what kind of poly i'll tell

550
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,120
you this

551
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,600
they're not supposed to say okay they're

552
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
just not

553
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
there's reasons we'll get to that later

554
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
um

555
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
but you should note that question note

556
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
that to yourself

557
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
be ready to talk to the recruiter about

558
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,280
it and talk to the interviewer about it

559
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,640
because you need to know we already

560
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
talked about okay

561
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,720
degree but really does my experience

562
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,760
count

563
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
i won't talk about this a time but they

564
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
they list all these

565
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
forensics tools um but is something

566
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,039
comparable going to be okay

567
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
or not i could talk about this one all

568
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
day long

569
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,280
i'm so frustrated that they listed all

570
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,120
those languages and they should have at

571
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,200
least split it into two different groups

572
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
right

573
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
so you should have your your c plus plus

574
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,159
and your

575
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,520
job over here and then you should have

576
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,039
all your scripting languages over there

577
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,760
because

578
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
frankly it's not exactly the same thing

579
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,600
so that's frustrating

580
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,760
so if you skip into the bottom when you

581
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
see words

582
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,559
like strong and good

583
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,120
they are subjective they should not be

584
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
under quals in fact i think

585
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
that they switched it i think they

586
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
should put their preferred

587
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,240
i don't know there should be a lot less

588
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,679
things that are

589
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,799
qualified basic quals and then a a

590
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,320
much longer list of things that are

591
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,240
preferred so shame on whoever did this

592
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,400
again is a lot to unpack

593
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,960
it's reasonable and it makes sense for

594
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,559
you to question these things and be

595
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,320
ready to talk to your recruiter about

596
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,960
them

597
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
and then to the hiring managers as well

598
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,280
so again you don't have a degree or

599
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,480
certain certs

600
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
ask the question i'm the perfect example

601
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
figure out this is a really good

602
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,360
opportunity for you to ask

603
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,559
okay cool can you provide

604
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,480
opportunities for me do you provide

605
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
opportunities for people do you have a

606
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
budget for reimbursing people for their

607
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
educational

608
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
expenses do you have growth plans for

609
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,360
people this is the opportunity for you

610
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,159
to figure out

611
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,440
really more about the company based on

612
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
what they're asking

613
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,600
you to come up with certs oh my god well

614
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,320
cssp is really hard and

615
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,600
sans is really expensive so is there a

616
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
budget for this as well

617
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
now when we talk about recruiters i

618
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
i will resist talking about them for too

619
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
long other than to say

620
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
good companies should have good

621
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
recruiters do they sometimes make

622
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
mistakes yes

623
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
they're people just like you have i ever

624
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
made a mistake yes have i ever dropped

625
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,240
the ball

626
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
or not gotten back to somebody sure but

627
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,600
i've never treated anybody like crap

628
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
and i've never not given them the time

629
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
that they deserve

630
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,080
i've never not answered their questions

631
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,919
nobody that has ever worked from

632
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,679
for me should have ever treated you like

633
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
crap so

634
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
be noticing how the recruiters are

635
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
behaving

636
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
and if they don't work for the company

637
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
that's a completely different story

638
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
right that's not indicative of

639
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
what's going to happen within the

640
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
company so an agency recruiter's a whole

641
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,200
different story for a whole different

642
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
day but if they work for the company

643
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
they should be taking the time remember

644
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,360
you're your own best advocate

645
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
remember that but they they represent

646
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,960
you

647
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
that you should think of them as like

648
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
your agent they should be doing what's

649
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,960
best for you

650
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,559
they shouldn't be calling you telling

651
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,720
you just about a job

652
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
they should be calling you finding out

653
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,720
about you

654
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
and saying you know what i called you

655
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
for this

656
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
but it seems like after i've talked to

657
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,919
you about the things that you want

658
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,000
need and are interested in you might be

659
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,080
a way better fit for that

660
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,360
ever had a recruiter from abc company

661
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,039
tell you you'd probably be happier at

662
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,480
xyz

663
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,159
don't forget their name they're pretty

664
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,919
cool

665
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,159
so your good recruiter gets you to the

666
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,280
interview table

667
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
and now remember you're your own best

668
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,799
advocate

669
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,960
you're going to address the things that

670
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
you saw

671
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
that didn't make sense or that you at

672
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
least want clarification on with regard

673
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,480
to the job description

674
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,799
you are going to take this opportunity

675
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,840
to address even before you get asked

676
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
to address the things that between your

677
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,880
resume

678
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,039
and the job description don't match

679
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,320
right you're going to say well i know

680
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,919
you're looking over here for this

681
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
but here's this other thing that i did

682
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,279
or that i have done

683
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,400
or that i'd like to do so take that

684
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,159
opportunity to address those things as

685
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,360
well

686
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,400
yes kovid i will say this

687
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,200
i will say besides beauty filters

688
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,799
i will say a good thing is

689
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,600
either fully online events that are

690
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,440
occurring or hybrid events that are

691
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,320
occurring

692
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,720
are giving more opportunities for people

693
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,080
that previously missed

694
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,039
out on the networking within events so

695
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,080
that's great

696
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,640
mock interviews they're happening here

697
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
are very very useful

698
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
this is an opportunity if you're doing

699
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,760
one today and and hopefully you are

700
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,400
if you're doing a resume workshop while

701
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,480
you're interacting with those people

702
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,600
with those

703
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
hiring managers and recruiters switch it

704
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
up and interview them as well

705
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,200
this is a really good learning

706
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,440
experience for you

707
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,600
so the bottom line is

708
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,559
every job post is a place for you to

709
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,000
start exploring

710
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
now you know that they're hiring figure

711
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
out what that company

712
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
seems to stand for and figure out a

713
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,760
little bit about the journeys that are

714
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
happening for the people currently

715
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,480
working there

716
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,640
determine if those things match up with

717
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
you and your current needs and

718
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
requirements

719
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,159
and be prepared to address all the

720
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,000
things that you identified that

721
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
don't look like at the match that we

722
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
talked about

723
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
if you are willing and able to learn

724
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
you're qualified for every single job

725
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,480
i promise that your concerns are valid

726
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
we're going to address them

727
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
you're going to address them your unique

728
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
journey got you here and made you

729
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,520
who you are just like mine did

730
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,400
it's not a contest no one is stronger or

731
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,200
smarter than you

732
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,080
i don't run ultramarathons because i'm

733
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
in the best shape

734
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,000
i do it because i flip the switch so

735
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,520
wherever

736
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
your finish line is whether it's

737
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,320
to be the ceo to double the size of your

738
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
company

739
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,600
to get your cissp whatever it is

740
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,320

741
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,960
