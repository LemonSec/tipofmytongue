1
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,079
okay hello happy saturday everyone i

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,720
hope everyone is doing very well on this

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,840
blended day today we have mary ann with

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,640
us who is going to present on secure

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
coding i'm very excited and looking

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
forward to this presentation i just want

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
to say thank you to our sponsors as well

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,720
and she's going to take it away and i

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
will sign off

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,520
hello everyone and welcome to diana

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
initiative and we'll be talking about do

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
your developers write super secure

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,160
coding

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,800
presentation will be discussing

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
projects and secure coding through all

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,640
the phases of the software development

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
lifecycle

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
and are your developers writing super

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
secure coding

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
and we'll be discussing all the tools

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,280
they need to be super

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,760
topics discussed will be

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,479
secure coding guidelines best practices

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,479
secure cutting standards

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,159
and checklists

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,320
and how to use them throughout the the

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,960
agile team meetings as well as care

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,600
cutting trainings and certifications

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
now we all probably know what these

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
terms mean secure writing guidelines

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
best practices and so forth

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
but not all of our development teams

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
actually use them or actually know what

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,439
they mean

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,320
so

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
let's go ahead and go through these and

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,360
make sure that we know as secure coding

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
practice practitioners actually know

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
what they mean as well

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,119
my bio

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,920
i'm actually a senior cyber engineer too

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
and i've been at raytheon for over 30

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
years

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,920
i've actually been a

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
cyber engineer for about 10 of those

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,079
years i was a software engineer for 20

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,040
of them

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,439
i have a masters in cyber security and

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,159
two certs in secure coding

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,520
i work with

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,560
programs and help them with the sca

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
process and sca tools and help them to

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,720
analyze their issues

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,560
and that's why i'm giving this

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
this

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
demonstration or this discussion on

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
tools and secure coding because i've

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
kind of found a problem with some of our

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
programs that say hey we're going to do

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
this but

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,440
i'm not seeing it being done

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,959
and so

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,080
even though

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
their requirements say they are

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
they don't always do it and so i have to

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
kind of help

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
a lot

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
so let's start out with the design phase

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
and how to use guidelines

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
so

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
most programs could create their own

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
coding guidelines

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
and

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
if you're going to create your own

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
coding guidelines for projects

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
it will really depend on the type of

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
organization that you are

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
and it will also depend on the type of

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
software you develop or the languages

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
that you use and that will depend

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
really on

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
or why

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
because it depends on

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
how complex or if you have to use

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
specific securities

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
or house your safety and so

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
coding guidelines are very

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,799
very specific to if it's safety if it's

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,120
hipaa if it's pii

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
so things related to coding guidelines

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,760
are for like

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
coding style understandability and

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,680
readability

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
but if you have

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
things for

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
languages and so forth related to those

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
as well

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,959
it's going to get a little bit more

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,360
hairy

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,519
but coding guidelines can also make it

101
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
so that your code is

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
your code may be too difficult to

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
understand so a secure coding guideline

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,200
can make it more easy and all of your

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
code could be

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,080
similar in readability

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
and once you have your coding reviews if

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
everybody's code is

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
designed the same way

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,798
it would make it easier to have your

111
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,160
code reviews

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
if your code is well documented

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
and you have a developer leave the next

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,800
person who picks up your code

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
that would make it easier for a new

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
developer or another developer to pick

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
it up and be able to fix something if

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
your code is not documented well

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,840
well

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,639
you understand i mean i've got programs

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
that have been around for 20 years

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
luckily i've got developers who've also

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
been around 20 years

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,520
so

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
in that case it's

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
a little bit easier to

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
fix that code but when some of those

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
developers leave some of these newer

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
newer developers are going to have

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
problems if that code is not well

131
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,160
documented

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
also having functions that are way too

133
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,360
large

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
oh my lord you have to talk about

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
spaghetti code i've seen some of those

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,039
and unfortunately i also though some of

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,120
those legacy programs that they did not

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
want to fix that code

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,479
but if you

140
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
i really wanted to fix some of it and

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
because i found errors and they said

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
nope fix that one line

143
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
and i finally left a program because

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
i couldn't handle

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,360
some of the code that i found it's like

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
all of this needs to be fixed nope fix

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
that one line

148
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
i finally left that program and left

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
went to another one because

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,520
i couldn't handle that

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,199
um in go to statements trying to debug a

152
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
program when you have a failure in a

153
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
code that has goto

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
that is

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,120
just problems

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
do try not to use go to statements that

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
should be in your guidelines try not to

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
use go to's

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,800
then we go to another guideline um

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
advantages of using guidelines is

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
your code if you have increased

162
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
efficiency

163
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,720
because everyone is doing the same way

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,520
so your your reviews are faster you have

165
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
less development time because all of

166
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
your code is being done the same way

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
your reviews are going to be faster and

168
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
you may find errors quicker because

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,199
everyone is developing the same way

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,840
so

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
another way to do it is using best

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,759
practices and making using rules to

173
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720
make your best practices better but also

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
using

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
coding standards and there are many

176
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
coding standards that can be used

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,639
as well

178
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,280
that can help you in your design phase

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
some of the best practices that can be

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,479
used for your design phase would be

181
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,520
commenting and documentation

182
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,479
making sure that you actually comment

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,919
and document

184
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,840
but a lot of

185
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,000
code in my static code analysis

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
trying to figure out sometimes

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,599
some of these

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,759
errors that i come across

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
code that is doesn't even have a header

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
and it's like what the heck does this

191
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,479
file do

192
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
is it even their code is it

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,160
somebody else's code what what does this

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,280
code do

195
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,680
there's no documentation no commenting

196
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,039
no nothing

197
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,199
i don't even know what this variable

198
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,280
does

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
you really need to have some kind of

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
documentation in a function some kind of

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,599
something

202
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,400
but

203
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
there's some programs that just have

204
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,039
nothing that is a best practice people

205
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,039
you really need it

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
and it makes it easier when you have

207
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
problems or even for new people like i

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,639
said to pick something up

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,000
consistent indentation

210
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,919
if you have code that has multiple

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,599
indentations

212
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
sometimes even a static code analysis

213
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,120
will tell you

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
hey this is an indented write

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
and you go to look at it it will

216
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
actually

217
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,759
i've got some that is indented

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,320
completely off and it'll you'll have an

219
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,919
if else that is completely not right

220
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,399
and i'm going they just

221
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,919
it's because they indented it wrong and

222
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,880
it was just really off

223
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
and so making sure that consistently

224
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,680
indenting make sure people are using

225
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,839
always in your program using always

226
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
using spaces or always using tabs ooh i

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
know i know everybody wants to use one

228
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
or the other but as long as you're

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,560
consistent that's the way to go

230
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
um i know some people always want to use

231
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
tabs it's cleaner but some people always

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,080
want to use spaces

233
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,279
consistent namings

234
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
there's still people that want to always

235
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,680
put an i before an integer they always

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,839
want to put an s before a

237
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
string as long as you have a consistent

238
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
naming scheme

239
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
and make sure your names are not

240
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,560
30 characters long

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,880
i mean come on people i'm still finding

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
some like that in some of the code i'm

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
reviewing

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
that's just really overkill

245
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,839
and avoid deep nesting again some of

246
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,839
those if else statements

247
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,959
that

248
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,560
i'm sorry i'm not doing their code

249
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,680
reviews i'm just doing the sca's but i'm

250
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
finding some of those and

251
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
avoiding the deep nesting those that

252
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,399
that kind of code could actually be

253
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,360
simplified i'm sure

254
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
there has to be a way to make that

255
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
simplified and

256
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
there has to be a way

257
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
because usually that means that you just

258
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
keep adding

259
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,920
cases as you've gone down and oh we

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
found another we found another we found

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,120
another there's there's got to be a way

262
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
limit line length limit the line length

263
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
to 80 characters you go to try to print

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
a print your file i'm sorry i'm old

265
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
school

266
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
um

267
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,200
when i would go to review

268
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
something i go print it and then i would

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
check it

270
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,880
but if

271
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,959
something is over 80 characters in

272
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,880
length like i've seen some

273
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
and it starts wrapping

274
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,399
try to look at that code and you try to

275
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,279
debug something like that

276
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
especially some of the c sharp code i've

277
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
been looking at lately

278
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,760
okay um yeah that gets kind of hairy

279
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,079
so make sure that your line length is

280
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
not because you've just

281
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,880
compressed all of your commands onto one

282
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
line

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,839
and then capitalizing sql statements now

284
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,160
that's good common practice that's so

285
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,560
that you can that jumps out at you

286
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
that's a sql command you know that

287
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
because sql commands

288
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
are capitalized

289
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,640
avoiding magic numbers

290
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
don't just assign a magic number don't

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,240
assign a number to something and don't

292
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
and without commenting on it if you've

293
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
got a comment as associated with a

294
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,560
number

295
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
assigned to a variable at least that

296
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,959
will tell someone

297
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
when you leave the company

298
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
that this number

299
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,680
is assigned because of

300
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,519
its

301
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
it was assigned because of this reason

302
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,480
because if for some reason that number

303
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
needs to change at least they know why

304
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
it was assigned in the first place

305
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
if it's just assigned and nobody knows

306
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,639
why

307
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,560
and it fails for some reason down the

308
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
road

309
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
hey we need to change that number now

310
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,399
why was it assigned in the first place

311
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
nobody knows

312
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
well if there was a comment associated

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
with it they would know why it was

314
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,880
assigned in the first place

315
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,920
so

316
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,560
if there's a reason for assigning other

317
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,639
than just initialization

318
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,760
for

319
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
zero

320
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,959
or true false something like that

321
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,000
that's

322
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,079
that's avoiding avoid magic numbers

323
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,120
always validate your input for any kind

324
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
of external data sources

325
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,839
again just a normal common best practice

326
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,320
any input coming into your

327
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
your your code should always be

328
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
validated

329
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
whether it's input strings characters

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,240
you know make sure that your your

331
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
numerics

332
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
anything coming in if even if it's

333
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
network values um something

334
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,000
coming in as path data make sure that

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,880
it's size wise everything is in is

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
validated people

337
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
don't just say oh it's

338
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,440
it's coming in from our our software we

339
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,279
know it's it's valid

340
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
no always validate your input

341
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
because you don't know

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,959
someone might have put something

343
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,440
in from another source

344
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
error handling and logging

345
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,320
ugh

346
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,959
that's been one of our biggest things

347
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,600
this weekend i think is logging

348
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
and some error i've heard some error

349
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
handling

350
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
but a lot of a lot of the code that i've

351
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
been seeing lately is also a lot of

352
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
error handling is missing

353
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,600
and so make sure that your code is

354
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
catching errors

355
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
a lot of programs that have been around

356
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
for years all of a sudden static

357
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
analysis is catching errors

358
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
really ah that error is never going to

359
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,320
happen

360
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
oh but it could

361
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
so put an error handler in there to

362
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,279
catch it otherwise your code could crash

363
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,079
and what happens if it could

364
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,279
oh that could go down not a very good

365
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
thing

366
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
why don't you put the error handler in

367
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
just in case

368
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,880
use the compiler's highest warning level

369
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
okay

370
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
now

371
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,440
maybe you don't want to do that because

372
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
okay you're gonna all of a sudden start

373
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
getting warnings that you never got

374
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
before

375
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
but

376
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
what are you using now

377
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,360
are you using the lowest morning level

378
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
i can almost guarantee you that most of

379
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,839
our developers are probably trying to

380
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,360
use the lowest one they can

381
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
but i don't know

382
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
check check with your developers check

383
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
to see what their warning levels are set

384
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,760
to

385
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,680
deny access by default yeah that's one

386
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
of those that's like um

387
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,399
what do people say

388
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,839
do you

389
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,880
check the conditions you know

390
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,440
do you always allow access do you always

391
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
exclude you know what what should your

392
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,360
code do

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
you know it depends on the the code

394
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
what what what is it depends what the

395
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,639
code's supposed to do so that one is

396
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,120
kind of one of those that you know

397
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
that's where the best practice is

398
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,480
okay

399
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
your code has to do one

400
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,759
or the other but deny access by default

401
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,040
that's one of those that's like oh okay

402
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,519
it says always deny access by default

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,440
yes that's supposed to be the case

404
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
another best practice is using a style

405
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
guide

406
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,199
formatter a beautifier and a style

407
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,399
checker

408
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,880
and those actually would make your code

409
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
beautified

410
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
makes everything pretty and lined up

411
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,959
indented

412
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
that's okay

413
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,399
as long as you don't have legacy code

414
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
thousands hundreds of thousands lines of

415
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
code like i do

416
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
i don't think i want to run something

417
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,880
like this against some of ours

418
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
because

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
i'm not sure what this would break

420
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
but if you've got new code

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
something running something like this

422
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,519
against your

423
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,320
against new code to make everybody's

424
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,839
code the same

425
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,800
this is a great idea

426
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
because

427
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
you know this would make it so that

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,920
everybody's is the same

429
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
and it would make it so that everything

430
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
is

431
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,160
following a standard format

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
these are some example

433
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,039
style guide checkers the beautifiers the

434
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,280
formatters

435
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,959
there's you know different languages

436
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,319
um

437
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
there's some for every language you can

438
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,839
think of everything from python to c

439
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,720
to

440
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,640
c plus plus

441
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,520
um

442
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,879
vb java

443
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,320
there's linters

444
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
everything in here

445
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
now like i said

446
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,559
at my site we don't use any of these

447
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,160
because a lot of our code is legacy so

448
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,679
we don't use these

449
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
but these were actually given to me by

450
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,000
another sort another source so

451
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
they say that these are great

452
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,240
so and and recommended that they that to

453
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,799
use these

454
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,840
for instance

455
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,760
this is great code this would work

456
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,799
but

457
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
in case of looking at code that looks

458
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
like this

459
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,919
oh no this is

460
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,440
i'm sorry

461
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
if i saw a code that looked like this

462
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,280
i would

463
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
throw that person

464
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
and no i i would throw them out of class

465
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
if if they were in a class that i had

466
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,720
because this is not

467
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
well formatted code i'm sorry

468
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,880
now that's a good good one for like

469
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
a for a

470
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
formatter or a beautifier

471
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
that would

472
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,720
then make it nice and pretty and well

473
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,600
formatted and if there was a problem

474
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,520
with the code would be found

475
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
very easily

476
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,760
because this you could find it

477
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
and

478
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,120
a static code analysis tool would make

479
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,960
it much easier to find sorry it went off

480
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
the page i couldn't put it all on one

481
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,360
page and make it readable

482
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,120
so now we're getting to standards

483
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,400
secure coding standards are used to

484
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
prevent introduction of security

485
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
vulnerabilities

486
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
okay

487
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
we all understand

488
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
security vulnerabilities or at least we

489
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,160
should

490
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
so

491
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
examples

492
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
one example of a security

493
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,799
standard

494
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,240
is the sei certs

495
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,640
down here at the bottom of the page is

496
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,760
a link to the sei

497
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,039
website

498
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,360
where you can actually download two

499
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
downloadable books

500
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
the

501
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
cutting standard for c and c plus plus i

502
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,799
have both of those printed out at my

503
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,720
desk because i am

504
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
c and c plus plus

505
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
uh coding standard

506
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,480
certified professional i actually

507
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
completed that cert that is one of the

508
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,120
secure cutting certification

509
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,840
that i do have i also have the white hat

510
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,159
certified secure coding professional

511
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,840
certification

512
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,400
um but actually at that site they also

513
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
have the sei coding standards for

514
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
android java perl

515
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,360
um but that site actually

516
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,200
a lot shows you all of the standards

517
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
from from sei

518
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,678
for all of these and they explain

519
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,039
each

520
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,880
of the different throughout each of

521
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
these languages

522
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,520
the standards and how to make sure that

523
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,919
a

524
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,240
vulnerability would not get into your

525
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
code

526
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,039
how to write

527
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,720
good secure code

528
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
now

529
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,679
it is

530
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,000
a little difficult for a

531
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
new developer maybe to

532
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,320
understand

533
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
and that is

534
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
probably

535
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,000
why

536
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
someone who is

537
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,480
unfamiliar with cnc plus plus maybe to

538
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,039
try to get

539
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,919
one of these professional certs

540
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,960
but

541
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
we did have some of our more advanced

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,919
developers follow the

543
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,600
just the regular cnc plus plus sei

544
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
training they came in and gave the boot

545
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,960
camp in our

546
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
building

547
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
so um you can actually

548
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
take the class and get the regular

549
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,280
regular cnc plus training as well i have

550
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,200
that link at the end of this

551
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
another coding standard is the nvd

552
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
coding standards now these

553
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
are the national vulnerability database

554
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
and it contains

555
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,559
links to perform analysis on the common

556
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,320
vulnerabilities and exposure cves

557
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,799
and associate cves

558
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,039
to

559
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
cvss

560
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
cwes and cpes

561
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,520
now this this database

562
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,960
or this standard um is a link to a whole

563
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,840
bunch of different

564
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,320
associated um

565
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,429
[Music]

566
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,840
standards and vulnerabilities and it's

567
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
it can tell you

568
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
a lot of different

569
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,000
vulnerabilities and

570
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,360
um

571
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,600
it can tell you how things all

572
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
interconnect and

573
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,640
how

574
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
one weakness can

575
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,200
link to another and how one

576
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
platform can link to one other

577
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
vulnerability and so forth

578
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,440
so

579
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,360
trying to use this by itself is

580
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,520
not a complete but it is part of

581
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
your

582
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
process

583
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,360
then we go to the cve website

584
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
um the cve website is

585
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
where the common

586
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,279
vulnerabilities and exposure the cves

587
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
can actually give you

588
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,000
a

589
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
list of the vulnerabilities

590
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,279
and give you examples of

591
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,120
fixes

592
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,000
in many languages

593
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
and

594
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,880
this is a site that

595
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
in

596
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
my job i've actually pointed several of

597
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
our developers

598
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,240
to how to fix some of their issues

599
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
because

600
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,720
it actually

601
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,760
we use coverity in our job in my job and

602
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,240
as a static code analysis tool and it

603
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,440
does have a link to cves

604
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,720
and for those developers who are newer

605
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,679
to

606
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,520
some of the languages and may not

607
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,960
understand

608
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
how to fix something

609
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,080
if

610
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
um they

611
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
may not

612
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
want to come they don't feel comfortable

613
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,400
coming to either myself or one of my

614
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
associates

615
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,679
i have pointed them to the cve database

616
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
and said and there are some samples um

617
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
on that database and if that doesn't

618
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
help you still come to me

619
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
and we can talk through

620
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,720
and

621
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,559
we can actu i can actually maybe show

622
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
you how to fix it

623
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,159
um

624
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,840
and so we've

625
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,120
we've actually

626
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,559
gone through the cv database and found

627
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,520
some examples on how to fix some of the

628
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,159
some of the issues

629
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,440
for

630
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
some of the problems we've had

631
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,320
okay um the other way to do it is

632
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,559
actually having programs or projects

633
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
create a their own

634
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,440
secure coding standard

635
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
at the end of my presentation i have a

636
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
link to

637
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,799
a project specific

638
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,159
secure coding standard document it a doc

639
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,000
that i found um

640
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,039
and it

641
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,320
links you to whether you're going to use

642
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,679
sei whether you're just going to use cwe

643
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,480
whether you're going to

644
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,159
use

645
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
uh style checkers whether you're going

646
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
to do this whether you're going to do

647
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,200
that

648
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,240
um

649
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
if you're going to include

650
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,400
high risks if you're going to do

651
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,159
specific things

652
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
and it actually was i thought a very

653
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,240
well thought out document

654
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,320
and um

655
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
like i said i've got a link to that

656
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,159
document at the end of my spreadsheet if

657
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
anyone is actually interested in it

658
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,320
it is at the end of my doc at the end of

659
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,960
my document

660
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,279
okay um for for reviews when you get to

661
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,960
code reviews for secure code reviews

662
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,000
if you do agile processes

663
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,919
sprint planning

664
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,320
sprint reviews do you include secure

665
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
coding reviews

666
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
such as manual code reviews or automated

667
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,120
code reviews and you track them

668
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,679
track this information in a tool like

669
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,159
azure

670
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,840
a manual code review

671
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,600
now

672
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
don't get all up in arms at me when i

673
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,559
say manual code review in this case

674
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,039
it's not what a lot of security people

675
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,840
think as a manual code review a manual

676
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
code review in this case is not going

677
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,279
through all the code and finding every

678
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,840
flaw that can be found

679
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
at this time

680
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
and every link that could be

681
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,520
evaluated

682
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,399
a manual code in this time frame means

683
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,200
just reviewing the code that was changed

684
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
at this time

685
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,559
for instance

686
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,600
um

687
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,640
this is doing a manual code when you

688
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
don't have

689
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,559
say azure set up

690
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,279
you're not doing an automated when

691
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,679
you're using jenkins or azure tfs azure

692
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,520
and

693
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,679
so this is a little bit different than a

694
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,440
normal manual code review

695
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,240
and you're thinking of a security review

696
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,200
this is this is a true code review i'm

697
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
going back to my old days here

698
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,000
um so who should attend these type of

699
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
reviews

700
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,120
someone with definitely someone with

701
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
domain experience you need someone that

702
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,279
understands

703
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,520
when someone made a change to this

704
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,559
code

705
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,679
did this code change

706
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,159
actually do any damage

707
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,399
um so someone with domain experience she

708
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,960
really should always check these reviews

709
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,559
so someone

710
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,399
hire up like a

711
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,520
um

712
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
a tech lead or someone someone

713
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,840
like a tech lead should always attend

714
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,799
these

715
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,679
i a

716
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,640
junior developer

717
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,279
should always probably attend these

718
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,399
and

719
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,200
have

720
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,320
your security personnel should start

721
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
should should probably attend these as

722
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
well

723
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,240
and then have code review checklists

724
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,480
the code review checklist we'll discuss

725
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,679
in a little bit but

726
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,520
if you use a code review checklist

727
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,679
we'll discuss why to use a code review

728
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,440
checklist but

729
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,960
um

730
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,000
this

731
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
this process is going to make it a

732
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,039
little bit easier

733
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,679
so doing a manual code review

734
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,399
if you do manual code reviews you find

735
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,640
logic errors and flaws where you might

736
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,919
find them in the design in the

737
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,279
architecture

738
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,559
and you

739
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,080
um

740
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,120
you find

741
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
you add room

742
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
um that

743
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,279
you have room for extra set of

744
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,799
experienced eyes you don't have just a

745
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,000
um

746
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
automated person an automated code

747
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
checking it you have experienced people

748
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,960
checking it plus you have

749
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,840
a

750
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,240
security person in there you have absent

751
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,000
knowledge you have people

752
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,880
that

753
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,600
like us reviewing it

754
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,440
the cons okay you have to have somebody

755
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,360
like i said you have to have a security

756
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,320
person

757
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,080
but you also need somebody that is

758
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,679
experienced with language and frameworks

759
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,720
in there

760
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
so um

761
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,640
you you have a little bit of a con in

762
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,480
there and then

763
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
if you're not using the checklist you're

764
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,720
going to get different reports so

765
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,760
that's why

766
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
i say you might want to use a checklist

767
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,399
because otherwise

768
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,679
it's not going to come you're not going

769
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,159
to have same reviews

770
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,760
so what should your checklist be

771
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,120
if you're going to use a checklist for a

772
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,320
program

773
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,000
probably should be language neutral

774
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,080
because i don't know about you but a lot

775
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,279
of my programs use multiple languages

776
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,279
i've got some that go

777
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,760
v b c c plus plus c sharp dot net

778
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
all on the same program

779
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
so

780
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,720
if they're going to have a checklist

781
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
it's probably going to be really

782
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
language neutral

783
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,600
have a plan of approach to approve code

784
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
changes

785
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,760
make sure that you always know it's only

786
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,480
going to be this amount of time

787
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
it's going to

788
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,320
include um this certain amount of things

789
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,760
um

790
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,799
don't over

791
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,200
don't overdo it people just

792
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
always include certain amount of

793
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,880
of topics

794
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,519
sections for a checklist

795
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,159
include things like exception handling

796
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,640
um auditing and logging

797
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
i mean you guys can all read all of

798
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,640
these but you know

799
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
make sure that you're you're verifying

800
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,240
that if you're in these sections

801
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,440
or it neat or or a section should have

802
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,880
these

803
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,039
maybe you should say hey

804
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,559
in the future maybe we should add these

805
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,360
i mean i know if you're only adding one

806
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
line you don't want to go in and say hey

807
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,480
you needed to add this no we don't

808
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
always want to add code

809
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,559
just because hey there wasn't an

810
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,960
exception handler you needed to add it

811
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,360
because we all know that if you add too

812
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
much code you're going to break

813
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
something

814
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,480
but you might want to add a new cr to

815
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,720
say hey in the future you might want to

816
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,080
add an exception handler to this section

817
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,760
and get it reviewed

818
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,559
at a later date

819
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,320
so other things like a general

820
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
libraries make sure your libraries are

821
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,799
up to date yeah

822
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,519
sensitive data hasn't been identified

823
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,360
okay that's something your security

824
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,559
person

825
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,799
is gonna have to make sure

826
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,039
layered security okay

827
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,559
that one's a little bit harder unless

828
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,240
your security person is familiar with

829
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,320
the design

830
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,919
some of these cryptography

831
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,200
input validation okay yeah some of these

832
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,799
are

833
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,240
are you checking for special characters

834
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
validating numeric input

835
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
we like we talked about earlier input

836
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,559
restricted to known characters

837
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,600
we talked about that earlier

838
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
checking

839
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,919
your inputs

840
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,000
authorization

841
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
um some of these

842
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,080
are you actually

843
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,640
checking are do you have things where

844
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,559
you have a url where you actually have

845
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,240
session cookies do you have

846
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,760
acls

847
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,320
where you actually have to authenticate

848
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
so now we're going to an automated code

849
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
review

850
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,120
so automated code reviews you can use

851
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,600
full code coverage

852
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,960
or nearly i i know not all

853
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
sdas can do full code coverage

854
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,359
but i have uh like my coverity i some of

855
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
my coverity can do almost full code

856
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,159
not i've got some that don't go all the

857
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,639
way but you can use tools like coverity

858
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,159
and fortify

859
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,119
and run it during an automated build and

860
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,639
best time to do

861
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,199
most the time is is when you're doing

862
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,960
the building development and run nightly

863
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,599
or when you're adding i have some that

864
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,879
run nightly

865
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,918
because they add code all the time

866
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,918
and then i have some that only run when

867
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,560
they add code to their

868
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,239
scm

869
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,280
some

870
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,040
and that's because

871
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,839
they add code so on

872
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,280
infrequently that

873
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,359
they don't need to run nightly they may

874
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,639
add code

875
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,599
once every other week

876
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
so coverity

877
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,280
just needs as an example for those that

878
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
aren't familiar

879
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,880
coverity you know as an sca tool helps

880
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,680
find

881
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
security and quality issues

882
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,960
and can be used to track um

883
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,200
across the application

884
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
and in

885
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,560
it can mute

886
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
with cyber and security working together

887
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,520
can be used to fix find and fix issues

888
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,640
that are found

889
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,319
and it supports 21 languages

890
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,440
looks similar to this with the dashboard

891
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,280
being on the side

892
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,680
and then the code in the middle

893
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
and then the triage window on the right

894
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,599
side

895
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,119
fordify

896
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,640
we have had some programs trying to use

897
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,960
fortify

898
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,520
haven't really had much luck getting too

899
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
much out of it yet

900
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,079
but you can get a prioritized result

901
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,480
again with by severity of risk you can

902
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
fix vulnerabilities with cyber and

903
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,400
software working together

904
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,839
and it supports 26 languages

905
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,359
its usage

906
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,880
looks like something like this

907
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,200
the

908
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,079
um cover there are some desktop static

909
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,440
analysis tools which coverity is one

910
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,400
and then desktop or developers can run

911
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,359
it from their desktops while

912
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,040
doing their development

913
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,599
and that way they can actually find

914
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,119
issues while they're actually doing

915
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,640
their development

916
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
and

917
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,280
if they actually inject issues they can

918
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,119
actually fix them

919
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,880
before they actually get sent up to the

920
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,400
desktop or excuse me sent up to the web

921
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,520
server

922
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,480
and that way you don't actually inject

923
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,800
issues all the way up

924
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
if you fix them

925
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,920
in earlier in the pipe in the the chain

926
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,680
and so

927
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,280
if you if you find or them earlier

928
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,119
you don't you inject

929
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,800
fewer issues and

930
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,839
fine

931
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,079
you can actually fix

932
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,079
issues earlier

933
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,520
but you can also fix maybe some that as

934
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,160
you're working on code if you see that

935
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,119
there's an issue related

936
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,520
to what you're working on say you are

937
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,599
working on

938
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,520
a line of code and there's a coverity

939
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,599
issue related to that you can actually

940
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,680
fix something related to that at the

941
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,240
same time and fix multiple coverity

942
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,560
issues at the same time

943
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,680
so it's we're we've got um

944
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,839
one program that's actually

945
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,760
doing that right now and they're

946
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,280
they're

947
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,320
injecting less issues and fixing more at

948
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,599
this fixing multiple issues

949
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,960
so it's

950
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,200
it's actually

951
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,319
working fairly well

952
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,880
so um the pros for doing an automated

953
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
code review is

954
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,599
it

955
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,839
it detects and

956
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,119
it may detect low hanging fruit and it

957
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,440
it may find a lot of vulnerabilities

958
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,320
um

959
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,079
but i it says that there may be a lot of

960
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:32,960
of

961
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,200
false positives but i truly have not

962
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,839
found a lot of false positives

963
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:38,880
um

964
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,000
not in a lot of our code

965
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,520
you can test quickly and have large

966
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,240
large large chunks of code

967
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,200
it's very important to do it in an agile

968
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,320
environment

969
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,280
um

970
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
to be able to test over and over and

971
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
over

972
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,800
and if you can do something like

973
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,720
static code analysis and be able to do

974
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,599
it in an automated environment

975
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,680
and

976
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,079
this is this is really the way to go is

977
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,839
to be able to have

978
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,400
the

979
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
to be able to run on schedule and then

980
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
on demand and then

981
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,200
it's we've got program i've got

982
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,520
something like 20 programs running this

983
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,079
way so it can be customized

984
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,240
be able to use all kinds of different

985
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,520
standards

986
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,599
but i've got it so that it's it's

987
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,440
running this way now

988
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,240
um cons it does say there's false

989
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,160
positive negatives but

990
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,320
really i'm not seeing very many

991
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,200
um

992
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
it does depend on the type of the tool

993
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
um

994
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,680
you have a learning curve

995
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,680
it did i have been doing it for over 10

996
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,359
years

997
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,560
so this i mean i was i was dumped into

998
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,119
it that was my first job as a as a

999
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,240
security cyber security person so

1000
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
that was my first job so i have been

1001
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,000
doing it for a while

1002
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,040
um

1003
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,319
so if it's it's also not viable for all

1004
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,160
budgets so

1005
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,200
you might try an open source tool if you

1006
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,400
can afford like coverity and fortify

1007
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,319
luckily we have a corporate license so

1008
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,079
that's why we can do it

1009
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,280
but we also had to merge

1010
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
all the data from one

1011
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,000
server over to my

1012
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
companies

1013
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,560
and

1014
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,800
my building and i am now manager for

1015
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,480
that server so

1016
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,040
that's why it's now my job

1017
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
another

1018
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,800
secure coding tool is code quality tools

1019
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,839
but

1020
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,319
using code quality tools like sonar cube

1021
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,960
and style cop you can use you can find

1022
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,880
code quality tools

1023
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
within your compiler

1024
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,040
and you can find issues

1025
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
and make your code better

1026
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
quality because even your static

1027
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,359
analysis tool will find quality issues

1028
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,359
but if you can use stone sonar cube and

1029
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,480
style cop to find those issues

1030
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
earlier on

1031
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,880
they would make your code better

1032
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,079
and

1033
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,720
less issues later on down the road and

1034
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,560
they can be used during your manual code

1035
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,160
review so that if you don't have an

1036
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,319
automated build you can still use center

1037
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,200
cube

1038
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,760
and style cop as just the desktop

1039
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,839
versions

1040
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,480
center cube has

1041
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,560
25 languages

1042
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,359
they have they they can find bugs

1043
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,240
are which are errors that break

1044
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,480
your code vulnerabilities

1045
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
your codes open to attack and then code

1046
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,839
smells

1047
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,680
just makes your code more confusing as

1048
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,399
what it says

1049
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,480
looks pretty much like this

1050
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,040
that's what i thought was very

1051
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
interesting it actually can do it for

1052
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,280
cobol and how many of us actually still

1053
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,160
remember cobol

1054
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,040
and

1055
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,240
stylecop

1056
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
can be set up

1057
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,800
to run during a visual studio build

1058
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,440
and it can be run automatically from

1059
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,280
tfs or

1060
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,920
jenkins i actually have

1061
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,240
two programs now that actually run it

1062
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,079
from azure

1063
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,760
and it can be run through

1064
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
a desktop mode in visual studio

1065
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,359
it looks like this if you actually have

1066
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,319
it run

1067
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,759
through your desktop mode

1068
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,400
when you click on one of those issues in

1069
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
the fir the previous page you get the

1070
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,480
actual error

1071
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,000
and it said this is

1072
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the cause and the rule description

1073
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,040
some of the training that can be found

1074
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,400
for secure coding include things like

1075
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,720
the certified secure software lifecycle

1076
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,760
professional which is my next cert

1077
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
i'm actually been studying for that

1078
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,760
the

1079
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,839
sci cert secure coding in java

1080
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,560
professional sci secure coding in java

1081
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,040
the sans develop defending web

1082
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
applications

1083
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,680
the seo secure coding and cnc plus plus

1084
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,520
which i said that was the one that they

1085
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,280
came out and did the the boot camp in

1086
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,400
our building and then the sei cert

1087
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,800
and secure coding and cnc plus

1088
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,480
professional cert that was the other one

1089
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,440
that i already have

1090
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,400
and then there's this game

1091
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,839
this is an amazing game by secure code

1092
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,040
warrior

1093
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,640
and it it was so much fun i had

1094
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,359
it was it was just a blast

1095
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,640
um

1096
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,119
you actually go in and you actually have

1097
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,119
to go and find

1098
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,560
the

1099
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,319
problem

1100
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,480
that they are talking about in each of

1101
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,079
the different languages and each

1102
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,800
each threat is a different language so

1103
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,839
you want you might have jabba ruby

1104
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:12,880
um

1105
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,440
c sharp.net you might

1106
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,079
each one was different um i am i had a

1107
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,400
15-day trial that i played with

1108
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,359
and but since i'm pretty presenting at

1109
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,200
four different conferences

1110
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
i didn't get much time to play with it

1111
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,839
but it was an amazing game to play

1112
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,319
so i really recommend this secure code

1113
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,359
warrior

1114
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,319
it was um it was amazing

1115
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,359
so um

1116
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
again this is the

1117
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,640
the

1118
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,640
checklist

1119
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,440
i mentioned

1120
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,760
um

1121
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
and some of the

1122
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,760
the secure coding standard

1123
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,480
some of the other

1124
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,480
trainings

1125
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,839
and there's hack.edu that's the the

1126
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,280
training

1127
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,160
that i just showed you

1128
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,119
but

1129
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,520
that's it

1130
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,880
so if you have any questions

1131
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,240
okay

1132
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
