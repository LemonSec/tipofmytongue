1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,080
so yeah i did link

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,920
um it's the same comic book that i

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,440
usually print out and

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
leave in the uh leave around on the

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,320
tables when we're in person

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,840
it also doubles as a coloring book

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
hmm

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
foreign

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
so

10
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,840
you

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
hmm

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
all right it's time i'm going to get

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
started um

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
12 p.m local 10 a.m and conference time

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
so let's go ahead and get started some

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
of you may know me i'm chris

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
i'm the i run the

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,319
maker village and design the badges

19
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,760
um badges for

20
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,280
the in-person conference and that i

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
design projects here to share with you

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,400
all

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
when we're virtual i do want to thank

24
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,000
our

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,720
sponsors ine elearn security

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
anaxis i guess that's how you pronounce

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
that and our platinum

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
and gold sponsors mongodb jupiter

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,280
networks

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
corelight google and bridge crew um and

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
mostly you guys because by doing

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,040
kids we actually self sponsored

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
we covered all of the expenses and

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,440
and i've got a little money for

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,200
prototypes for next year so yay

36
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
um and so before we get going

37
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,800
um i do want to go over some of the

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
tools that you might see in the screen

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
just so that just in case you do want to

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,200
do more of this

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
get more kits maybe design your own

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,440
things

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,760
things so that you can think about those

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
things

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,239
so let's switch over to number two

46
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,120
number three

47
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,440
okay so

48
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,799
there we go oop wrong button

49
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,239
there we go all right so first up

50
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
um thank you

51
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,360
first up we got a resistor bender um

52
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
this one i actually inherited it's

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
actually in radio shack red to give you

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
some idea of how old it is

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
um you can put 3d print these you can

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,519
find them online

57
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
basically there the idea is that you get

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,599
the nice

59
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,880
perfect u for your resistors

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
like so

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,639
[Music]

62
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,960
yay and then that will slide into the

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
board much easier

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,639
also your soldering irons the tips need

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,840
to be shiny

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,639
shiny shiny shiny otherwise nothing will

67
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
melt

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
and which brings us to our next tool

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
as far as heat goes that's going to

70
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,360
depend on the solder

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,199
if you're getting good solder it should

72
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,880
have a temperature range on there for

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
you

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
because it is going to vary depending on

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,280
the the formulation of the solder

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
but the big thing is that we need to

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
keep the tip shiny shiny

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,039
um i like a a flat wedge tip

79
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,440
some people like round tips once again

80
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,000
that's a personal preference thing

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
that also brings us to our next tool

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,759
which is this

83
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
um it's basically it's brass it's like a

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
brass scrubby pad

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
um in a little container um

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
i like this i think um it's a little

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,520
easier on the

88
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,320
iron than using a wet sponge although

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
you can use a wet sponge some people

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
like a wet sponge

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,199
but because the tip of the iron loses

92
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
less heat using this than a wet sponge

93
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,240
i prefer the brass plus then if you're

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,880
carrying

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
it if you have to carry your kit you

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
don't have to worry about

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
finding water and dealing with putting a

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
wet sponge someplace when you're done

99
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,360
some of the other tools that you're

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
definitely going to see or need

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
grandpa always called these nippers

102
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
they're technically they're side cutters

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
or flat cutters

104
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,680
because the because they're at an angle

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,039
so that you can get in there and make

106
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,240
the back of the board flat

107
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,360
see what else we got here okay

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
another thing you might want to consider

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
for purchase later if you keep doing

110
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,680
this

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
is some good solder wick

112
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,960
basically it's fine copper thread

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
with lots and lots of flux in it so you

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
heat it up

115
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,520
heat it up it'll take away any excess

116
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
solder

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,840
um i do recommend

118
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
this particular brand grootwick um it's

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
made in japan and it's just awesome

120
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,080
let's see we talked about that we talked

121
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
about that um

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,319
this may have come in your kids if you

123
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
were

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
if you were uh if you bought one of the

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
kits that i recommended it's a solder

126
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,440
sucker

127
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,080
you basically you push down the plunger

128
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
and then push the button

129
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
and it creates a small short-lived

130
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,160
vacuum

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
and as you can see maybe and see how it

132
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
left a little mark on my finger even

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
um so that's a solder sucker and i'll

134
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
show you how to use that when we get

135
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
started

136
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
other tools you might see are

137
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
tweezers they're nice to have when you

138
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
get tweezers

139
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,680
make sure they you get the esd kind this

140
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
isn't really so much a paint

141
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
as it is a coating if i were to shuffle

142
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,680
across the carpet

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
grab one of these and then grab one of

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
these and then grab a component

145
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
any static electricity that i picked up

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
is not going to be transferred to the

147
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,479
part

148
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
and um i got these with the big round

149
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,840
tip

150
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,719
they're good for

151
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
um cats generally will stay away once

152
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
you start soldering

153
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
along with other pants because it kind

154
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,440
of smells

155
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,720
so they should be all right um

156
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
and we're not working with anything

157
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
overly sensitive here

158
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,759
um if we were doing you know

159
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,199
things that were a little more sensitive

160
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,360
than i would say yeah it might be a good

161
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
idea to shoot the cat out of the room

162
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
but cats are gonna cat so it doesn't

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
matter

164
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
um

165
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
so ron so i gotta run i got a blends

166
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,039
here with a big round tip those are good

167
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,400
for through-hole

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,159
um another example here these are really

169
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
tiny

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
better for um

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,159
better for surface mount components

172
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,000
um these are some cheap ones that came

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,959
in a kit i

174
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
kind of would stay away from these if

175
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,440
you can

176
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
because they're not coated they are

177
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
going to any static discharge on your

178
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,399
body is going to be transferred to your

179
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
work

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
and finally two things

181
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
i have really bad eyesight so these are

182
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,560
always a good idea

183
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
these are i call them cheaters um

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
they're they're going um it's basically

185
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
it's a magnifier that clips onto my

186
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
regular

187
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
progressive lenses

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
and then finally the last tool this is

189
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
entirely optional

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
but it's a really good idea eventually

191
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,720
to get one of these

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,200
and that is our friend the multimeter

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
let's see if i can get her in frame here

194
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
that'll work

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,800
this is a fluke 101 you don't need to go

196
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
this expensive a 10 15 model is just

197
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
fine

198
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
i just decided to spend some of my

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
stimulus money and treat myself

200
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,120
um so

201
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
the and the three things that you're

202
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,920
going to do the most with any multimeter

203
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
are um first what

204
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
is this resistor so if you take one of

205
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,959
your resistors

206
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,120
and take the little probees

207
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,560
and you find out that it's reading 11

208
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
2 that's within tolerance it's supposed

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
to be a 10 ohm resistor

210
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
the other handy thing that you can do

211
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
with a multimeter

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
is check diodes so like i've got this

213
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,000
diode here that i pulled out of a

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
breadboard

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
and now say i want to use it for

216
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
something else well which side is which

217
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,440
i don't know so there again

218
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,360
oops not that way let's try this way

219
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,279
and if we get a little bit of glow maybe

220
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
yeah we do get a little bit of glow

221
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
so now i know that this side here is the

222
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,560
positive and this is the negative

223
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,839
and it really becomes important later on

224
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,200
to have these features

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
because as you grow and get into more

226
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
advanced things

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
that little dot there is actually a

228
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,720
resistor

229
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,399
and this little dot here on your screen

230
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
is actually an led it's surface mount i

231
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,560
do believe it's an 805 package they come

232
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
much smaller

233
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
but they're again this trying to figure

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
out which side is which

235
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
much easier to do

236
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,320
with a multimeter

237
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,279
and then finally the last thing that you

238
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
definitely would want a multimeter for

239
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,199
is i don't know if you can hear this

240
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
it's playing a tone because i've touched

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
the probes together

242
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,639
so basically if you have a board and

243
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
you're trying to figure out

244
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
where something goes or what it's doing

245
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
we go say into here and i'm cheating a

246
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,560
little because

247
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,839
oh you can't see just a second

248
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
and i'm cheating a little because i know

249
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
where these kind of go

250
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
so if we take this one here which is a

251
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,839
ground

252
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,440
we know that it's going to be somewhere

253
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
in here

254
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,920
and we get the tone again with where the

255
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
ground pin is

256
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,639
on the board so that's a multimeter like

257
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
i said you don't have to go

258
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
this one was a little spendy

259
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
the 10 15 20 one you see at walmart

260
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
is fine for a beginner just make sure

261
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,720
that it does have those three functions

262
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
resistance a diode function

263
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
and of course is there a particular temp

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,399
we should target um

265
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,279
it should say on your solder um i use

266
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,480
leaded solder

267
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
and i'm running at 325 celsius

268
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,120
so that would be a good starting point

269
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
if you've got lead-free solder that's

270
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
going to be hotter

271
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,639
but oftentimes depending on your

272
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
manufacturer it gives it might give you

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,320
a

274
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
range on the side unfortunately the

275
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,000
stuff i

276
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
bought did not otherwise i'd put it on

277
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,600
the

278
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,959
on the screen um i like using what's

279
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
called a 63 37 mix

280
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,839
which is um 37

281
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,920
lead i know lead lead lead

282
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,440
um lead is one of those weird topics

283
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,519
when it comes to hobby electronics

284
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,360
some people are like oh my god no no no

285
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,240
no um the reality is is that if you read

286
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,720
the

287
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,199
material data safety sheet for leaded

288
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,800
solder

289
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
it's going to tell you to not lick your

290
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
hands

291
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,959
not lick the solder and wash your hands

292
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,240
when you're done

293
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,279
that's pretty much it

294
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,720
and you'll be fine so let's go ahead

295
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
and get started on our build and we're

296
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
going to start with our resistors i've

297
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,720
already got the

298
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
10 ohm resistors bent they should have

299
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,959
been blue

300
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,199
in the packaging i do believe i sent

301
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,880
those out a while ago i'm can't recall

302
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,079
off hand but

303
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,079
so we're going to start with the 10 ohms

304
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,440
ohm

305
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
you'll know these for two reasons one

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
there was a pack of two resistors as

307
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
opposed to our packet four resistors

308
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,359
so let's go ahead and get those

309
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,839
you can try to bend them in a u-shape

310
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
just with your fingers that works just

311
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,839
fine

312
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,519
but we're going to go ahead and throw

313
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,839
those in

314
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,040
at r1 and r2

315
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
and you can put them both in at the same

316
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,199
time

317
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,320
if i can get my fingers to work so they

318
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,800
should be

319
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,279
flat against the board i should really

320
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,480
be watching the screen here

321
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
they should be flat against the board

322
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
with the other end sticking up

323
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,880
and you can bend them out just a little

324
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
bit just to make sure that they stay

325
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
flat when as you're flipping the board

326
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,600
around

327
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
or moving or checking um

328
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
checking so let's go ahead and solder

329
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,959
these and i think i got a little more

330
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,760
magnified view

331
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,399
if we get into position here there we go

332
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
so there's our first

333
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,240
resistor ready to go i'm going to go

334
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
ahead and

335
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
make sure my tip is shiny shiny

336
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,040
uh emily this is a ball of um

337
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,560
of like a brass scouring pad and i like

338
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
it better than

339
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,440
say using a wet sponge as we

340
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,160
um as it's often

341
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,079
as it's often a little uh it's a little

342
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,240
you lose less heat uh using a ball of

343
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,880
of of a brass floral pad like this

344
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,759
versus

345
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,839
using a wet sponge um it's just a

346
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,800
preference

347
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
know the direction of the resistors do

348
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
not matter it will re

349
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,279
it will slow down the electrons no

350
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,480
matter which way you put it in

351
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,279
so let's go ahead and do one here

352
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,880
there's

353
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,199
one

354
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,880
and two

355
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,040
and so what we're looking for

356
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
and so what we're looking for here

357
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,039
you're in

358
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,160
get that screen there we go

359
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,359
um is kind of a hershey's kiss shape

360
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,199
it should be flat where it touches the

361
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,000
board and then kind of

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
cone up onto the thing so let's do the

363
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
other one

364
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:33,840
spinish finish binny here we go

365
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:47,840
and bring out some more solder here

366
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,919
yeah looks like there we go

367
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,160
and there's one and there's two

368
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
and we'll go ahead and clean

369
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
and stamp cheaters there we go

370
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
okay

371
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,799
okay so we've got one and two done

372
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,880
and looks like this one here

373
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
oops this one here i'm gonna rework a

374
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,960
little

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,039
it was a little cold you can tell it's

376
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,600
not quite touching

377
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,280
the component so let's go ahead and make

378
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,679
sure

379
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,760
our iron is clean

380
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,600
and get back in there

381
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,280
and just give it another go here

382
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,200
there we go

383
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,000
[Music]

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,280
so that's one and two done

385
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
so we'll take our clippers

386
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
and when you clip off things um hold on

387
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,200
to the other piece

388
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,840
piece otherwise you'll send them flying

389
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,360
um and trust me if you've ever stepped

390
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,480
on a lego

391
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
thousand times worse that was

392
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,799
way worse way way way worse

393
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,520
there we go so we grab this

394
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,960
clip at the top of the solder and boom

395
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
done

396
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,720
[Music]

397
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
and as you can see on the front and

398
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
we're gonna go back to

399
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,840
this view i think is a little better

400
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
as you can see we've got our two

401
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,919
resistors now

402
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,960
now these are 10 ohm for the blue um

403
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
the rest of them take 68 ohm

404
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
when i was first when they first

405
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
announced the pico board and i was doing

406
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,799
this project

407
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
they actually had the resist the

408
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,880
resistors for using leds with the pico

409
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,840
listed at

410
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
at 220 ohms um

411
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
yeah that and the math didn't add up on

412
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,960
that so that's why

413
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
if you see documentation for the phi

414
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,760
pico it may say to use a 220 ohm

415
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,039
resistor

416
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
the math says to use the ones that i've

417
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
included in the kit

418
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,240
so there's one and two and so now we're

419
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,760
going to move on to the rest of them

420
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
what if what am i doing wrong if the

421
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,880
melted solder climbs up the iron and not

422
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
on the board

423
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
clean the tip

424
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,799
clean the tip the tip of your iron

425
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,760
should be

426
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,120
shiny shiny shiny you may need to

427
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,799
tin your tip which is basically

428
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,960
we take a little solder and we melt it

429
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
on to where it needs to be shiny shiny

430
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,900
shiny

431
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,179
[Music]

432
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,840
and then clean it again

433
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
almost time for a new one all right and

434
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
then it will again be shiny shiny shiny

435
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,880
and

436
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:17,840
flow much faster

437
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,000
all right

438
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:31,840
so we've got our bender

439
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,360
and i'll do one by hand just to kind of

440
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,960
show you that it can be done by hand

441
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
just take a finger

442
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
hold the main part of the component bend

443
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
it down

444
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
same situation

445
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,120
okay so the other four resistors are

446
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,159
going to go in the other

447
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,200
four four holes marked with an r so

448
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
that's going to be r4

449
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
r5 oh excuse me or

450
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,400
r3 r4 r5 on r6

451
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
and we're going to set once again we're

452
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,080
going to place them all at once

453
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:27,840
so that we can solder them all at once

454
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,840
here's the other one

455
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
so there we go they're all flat flip it

456
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,520
over

457
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,840
do it again and i'll do the first

458
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,640
plop over okay there we go and if we

459
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,039
switch

460
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,320
views here here to the magnifying blue

461
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,000
i'm going to go through this joint in s

462
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,440
in very great detail just so that you

463
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
get a better feel for it and we're on

464
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,679
my this one here

465
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,559
okay so

466
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
um first thing we're going to do is we

467
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
want to touch the tip to

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,280
both the the circle pad and the

469
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
leg of the component and you really only

470
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,120
need to touch it for a second

471
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
or two we want to get that good and hot

472
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,480
and then add in

473
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,919
dip in with your solder and that's

474
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,640
really all there is to it

475
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
it takes a little practice like anything

476
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
else

477
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,840
but that really is all that is to it

478
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,400
we want to heat up the work add a little

479
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,760
solder

480
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,840
let it cool on its own

481
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:19,840
no flip back here

482
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,600
and another tip is don't be afraid to

483
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
move your thing to where you're working

484
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
in a comfortable position

485
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,720
if that means flipping the board turning

486
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,279
the board

487
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
doing a part and clipping those leads so

488
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,640
that you're not tripping over them

489
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,360
do what you need to do to make sure that

490
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,000
every joint

491
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,720
that you're doing

492
00:24:50,159 --> 00:25:01,760
is as easy as possible

493
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,480
once again we'll trim these and

494
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,960
get out the little baby waste bucket

495
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,440
and tidy up all right so

496
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
if you have soldered on all of your

497
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,360
resistors

498
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
let me know by throwing any kind of

499
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,840
smiley face

500
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,080
emoji check mark okay

501
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
whatever in the chat and we'll give

502
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
everybody a couple of minutes before we

503
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:43,840
move on

504
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,919
messed up okay yes we will get to that

505
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,360
right now as long as

506
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,440
as as uh we have a question

507
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,320
um let me put this aside i'm going to

508
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,039
bring this out

509
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,440
it's just a scrap perf board it's much

510
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,320
easier for me

511
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,080
to demo things like this on a

512
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,279
scrap piece of perf board than

513
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,679
anything else um so i'm just going to

514
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
grab

515
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
random led um we're not going to really

516
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,240
worry about what

517
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,400
how the led is other than going to slap

518
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,559
it on with too much solder and

519
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,840
go from there so we have our led

520
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
and let's say we have

521
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,639
way too much solder

522
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,880
shrink uh that's a lot

523
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
and that's a lot and oh can i get a

524
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,799
bridge can i get a bridge

525
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,840
nope can't get a ridge today okay so if

526
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,559
you have

527
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,600
too much solder the first thing i would

528
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,080
try

529
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,760
is just reheat it um a lot of it will

530
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,720
flow

531
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,600
into the hole and actually come out a

532
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,000
little bit

533
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
on the other side and that's usually

534
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,158
okay

535
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
another way to get rid of excess solder

536
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,799
or in this case

537
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,440
remove the part solder wick

538
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,320
if you have some

539
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,480
will absorb all of this and i should be

540
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
able to get the resistor

541
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,840
or the led here out

542
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,679
and as you can see i use the solder wick

543
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,799
i got the led back out

544
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,840
another way you can do this

545
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
and i would only do this if you are

546
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,559
alone in the room

547
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,919
is if you watch these holes here

548
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,159
make sure see i've got some filled holes

549
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,440
here

550
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,840
maybe if we can tilt it a little bit um

551
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,679
what you can do is you can heat it for

552
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,640
a while and this is real old school

553
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,919
method of doing this

554
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,720
is you heat it make sure it's really

555
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
really hot

556
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,200
and then slam it down and as you can see

557
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,799
maybe that middle hole

558
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,559
hole is now empty

559
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,320
that middle hole that did have a bunch

560
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,200
of solder in it

561
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
we'll now take a leg of this demo

562
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,080
led whereas before it was solid

563
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,440
third is if you're if you bought one of

564
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,520
those starter kits

565
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,399
you got our solder sucker push it down

566
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
heat up the work

567
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,600
and it's good hot press the button

568
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,880
and that too if we can get

569
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,480
and a little blurry

570
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,840
let's go over here let's try the other

571
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
view

572
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,799
and microscope is there okay and as you

573
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,480
can see on the top row i cleaned out

574
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,240
that middle one by slamming it against

575
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
the board

576
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
by slamming it against the table and the

577
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
bottom right i use the solder sucker

578
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,279
sorry that's a little blurry

579
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,840
down a little bit

580
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,640
otherwise continue on matt

581
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
we've got a session coming up at noon

582
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,159
where i can help you a little more

583
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
where you where where we'll be able to

584
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,919
help you a little further

585
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,840
further and have you take over the the

586
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,900
camera to show me where you're at okay

587
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,229
[Music]

588
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:09,679
all right

589
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,279
and i'll also pull out a different scrap

590
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,279
board that's a little easier to see

591
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,919
so i'm going to go ahead and go back to

592
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,159
the build now

593
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
trim off the rest of the resistors

594
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:37,840
so that i can lay my board flat

595
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,189
[Music]

596
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,719
and i have no nails

597
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,279
all right so

598
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,960
and we'll go back to the other view

599
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,440
all right so we've got our resistors

600
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,360
they're all done nice and pretty

601
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,000
pretty it's time to move on the next

602
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
thing on our build list

603
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,200
is going to be the leds

604
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,559
um would you if you when we're doing it

605
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,159
when you're doing a build just on a

606
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:22,799
table

607
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,080
or in my case a nice silicon mat um

608
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,918
you want to go from the flattest thing

609
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,039
on up so if so

610
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,880
the things that's going to be shortest

611
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,960
to the board we want to do first

612
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
the things that are tallest we want to

613
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,519
do last

614
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,000
so we're going to move on to our leds

615
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,679
we'll do the blue ones first just like

616
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
we did their resistors first

617
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,000
and now a note on the anatomy of an led

618
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,240
if you look at a through-hole led

619
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,919
very carefully you're going to find that

620
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,600
one side

621
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,678
of the bottom ring is going to be flat

622
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,200
and you can kind of see it here let's

623
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
see if we can get it

624
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
there we go get up in the magnifying

625
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,559
corner maybe

626
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,640
okay this bit is flat um let me see if

627
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,039
i've got

628
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,200
um here's a here's actually a 10

629
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,559
millimeter one you might be able to see

630
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,640
it a little better

631
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
but we can see that where the negative

632
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,039
leg is that that is actually a flat

633
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,080
surface

634
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,919
if you can't see it you can definitely

635
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,559
feel it

636
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,840
where one side is flat that flat

637
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,480
side indicates the negative length it

638
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
also matches

639
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,240
the silk screen on the board

640
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
so find your little flat notch and make

641
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,840
sure

642
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,600
that your leds are lined up with that

643
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,479
so we'll add our two blue leds

644
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,640
you get flat side there we go and it's

645
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,960
usually the shorter leg is also

646
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,519
the flat or negative side okay so we've

647
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,880
got our two blue leds

648
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,840
he's in now put your thumbs on the board

649
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,120
and go and turn them over now when you

650
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,440
do

651
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
leds um especially

652
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,919
when we're doing them like this with

653
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,840
just a table

654
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,399
there's a little trick here what we're

655
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,320
going to do is we're going to do

656
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,840
one leg on each of them

657
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,080
yes we're going to do this first leg

658
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,440
here

659
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,399
and here

660
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,239
and then we're going to just double

661
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,479
check

662
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,960
that these are flat to the board and if

663
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,280
they're not flat to the board

664
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,960
just go ahead and refill reflow i'm

665
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,480
sorry reflow

666
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,079
the the one joint with

667
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
a little extra heat and a little

668
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,399
pressure on the top

669
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:48,320
and you will always get nice flat leds

670
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,719
so then we can go ahead and finish these

671
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,839
up

672
00:34:51,839 --> 00:35:03,839
make sure we're in frame here

673
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,689
[Music]

674
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,599
and we're gonna go ahead and nip those

675
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,839
off

676
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,000
okay

677
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,280
all right does everybody have their blue

678
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:45,839
leds done

679
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,239
[Music]

680
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
um the flat side should be this the okay

681
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,520
preamast miss the led part will the

682
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
shorter leg of the led go to the flat

683
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,119
side yes the shorter

684
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,520
the shorter leg should be lined up with

685
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,200
that flat notch

686
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,240
which should match the flat part of the

687
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,839
silk screen there

688
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,240
okay so let's go ahead and we'll move on

689
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,800
to the green ones

690
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,240
and same thing short flat

691
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,598
according to the silk screen

692
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,839
and short flat according to the silk

693
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,400
screen these should be the middle leds

694
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,119
three and four

695
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,359
um try turning up sakura

696
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,960
asked what am i doing wrong the solder

697
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,359
isn't melting as quick as mine

698
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,440
turn up the heat a little um

699
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,839
if you bought a one of those

700
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,920
everything you need kits from amazon

701
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,160
they include lead-free solder which

702
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,440
um in a tube like this which needs a

703
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,119
little more heat than the stuff i'm

704
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,210
using

705
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,640
[Music]

706
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,040
so i would try see i'm at 350 centigrade

707
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,079
i would try

708
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:51,520
i would try 400.

709
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,720
so let's go ahead

710
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,920
find a good camera angle here

711
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,839
clean the tip

712
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,880
and we'll go ahead and do the leg that's

713
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,440
closest to me

714
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:17,890
there

715
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,040
[Music]

716
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,359
there

717
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,839
and there

718
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,599
and then we'll just check these they're

719
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,760
flat

720
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,800
that one looks good

721
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,599
that one's up a little so let's go ahead

722
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,000
and do that trick again

723
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,240
where we're pressing down on the led

724
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
we're pressing the led towards the board

725
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,640
and just letting the solder reflow a

726
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,079
little bit

727
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,040
oh hey we let that reflow a little too

728
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,839
much

729
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:14,079
oh the joys of live demos

730
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,240
so all i did was i heated that up from

731
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,680
the top

732
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,400
made sure i could get my leg through and

733
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,760
now we're just gonna hold it for a

734
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,280
second and make sure it's cool

735
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,680
before we try flipping the board over

736
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,078
okay

737
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,599
and a little off screen there

738
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,839
there we go there's one

739
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
and two

740
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,280
yeah one's still a little high it's okay

741
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,040
and it's still a little high so

742
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,599
once again

743
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,839
a little rework

744
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:25,520
and we're good

745
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,040
and we'll go ahead and trim those

746
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,119
and go ahead and give me an okay okay

747
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,880
an emoji whatever if you've got your

748
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,440
green

749
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:53,839
and blue leds done

750
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,839
hours

751
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,839
okay

752
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
oh

753
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,480
all right we're going to move on to the

754
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,119
reds then

755
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,240
and there's one

756
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:31,839
and there's two and we'll flip the board

757
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,079
add some solder

758
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,680
there and there

759
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,359
and we'll check the positioning

760
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,400
and if we're off a little that's okay

761
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,000
that's why we only do the one leg

762
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,960
spin it around check the other one

763
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,839
[Music]

764
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,839
and then solder the other leg

765
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,800
uh

766
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,040
clippy clippy

767
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,839
[Music]

768
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
done

769
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,399
okay moving on to the buttons

770
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,040
your buttons came in two parts

771
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,079
you had this guy here

772
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,160
and then of course she had the cap the

773
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,720
caps just snap on

774
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,760
like so but let's uh until they're on

775
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,640
the board let's leave the caps off

776
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,490
just makes it a little bit easier

777
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,920
[Music]

778
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,280
now unlike our resistors and our leds

779
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,960
these you have to put in kind of

780
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,280
work the two legs in on one side and

781
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,400
then they just kind of snap in place

782
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,360
on the other

783
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,400
[Music]

784
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,079
and they do take a little more work to

785
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:51,839
get in than our leds so there's one

786
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:05,839
here's two

787
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,079
and then we'll flip them up now the

788
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,680
thing with

789
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,920
when once we get the buttons is the

790
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,359
buttons a they're going to take a little

791
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,160
more solder

792
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,920
and a little more time to do and b

793
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,400
we're not gonna clip the leads they're

794
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
already short and rounded we don't need

795
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
to

796
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,839
so let's go ahead and get those attached

797
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,520
and there's one side

798
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,759
[Music]

799
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,880
[Music]

800
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,160
and i'll flip

801
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,839
this in

802
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,760
and then we'll flip to the mouth flip to

803
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,160
the magnified view here a little bit

804
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,760
so you can see how those

805
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,839
joints are just slightly different

806
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,119
from the ones we have been doing

807
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,119
so yeah they're a little bigger they'll

808
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,839
take a little longer a little more

809
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:42,400
solder and we don't need to clip them

810
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:56,240
so there's our buttons

811
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,839
okay so that now our buttons are in

812
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:11,839
place we can add the caps

813
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,259
[Laughter]

814
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,839
yay all right and is everybody caught up

815
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,839
to this point let's go ahead and flood

816
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,760
the chat with more emojis

817
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,839
um that's windows period if you're on

818
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:30,960
windows oh

819
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,839
just it's not done it's fine we can wait

820
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,319
we're okay

821
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
this is my room if we need more than an

822
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,280
hour that's fine

823
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:53,839
not a huge deal

824
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,920
you

825
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,839
you

826
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,480
all right

827
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,880
all righty so as much as i'd like to sit

828
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,240
and read my twitter feed

829
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,000
um is everybody ready to move on

830
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,839
yes okay

831
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,599
so next we're going to do the screen

832
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,440
which is the last component that sits on

833
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:35,839
the top

834
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,400
of the board okay matt we'll wait we can

835
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
wait

836
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,839
um

837
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,839
foreign

838
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,680
okay while we're making waiting for

839
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,280
matthew a little note on the little

840
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,800
screens you got

841
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,640
most people should have gotten this

842
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,400
screen

843
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,520
with a black pcb some of you may have

844
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,240
gotten

845
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,799
this blue pcb

846
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,599
um and they're the same board um they

847
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,000
just

848
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,280
redesigned it so the black one is a hair

849
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,839
so the hat so the black one is a hair

850
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:48,960
smaller

851
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,079
um it really isn't any big deal it's the

852
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,520
same components they just found a way to

853
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,880
shave a sliver of pcb off of them

854
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,079
off of them and

855
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,200
with supply chain issues obviously

856
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,720
getting 50 of one thing isn't always

857
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,760
easy

858
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,960
um so

859
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,800
they said i ordered these they sent in

860
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,119
somewhere somewhere these it's not a big

861
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,920
deal

862
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,480
um that's the other thing is that these

863
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,240
do come in

864
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,319
two or three different colored screens

865
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,599
so

866
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,319
it's supposed to be white um we'll give

867
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,319
them a pass because i got a really good

868
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,599
deal if some are blue or yellow

869
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,760
not a big deal so let's put so we'll use

870
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,800
the blue one

871
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,000
on this first build here

872
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,319
and so what we're doing is we're

873
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,599
basically matching the

874
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,800
the silk screen there's a little bit of

875
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,520
flexi connector and that lines up with

876
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,480
this notch

877
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,000
and then the four holes on top

878
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,880
go right in um and this thing is not

879
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,200
going to

880
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,480
um sit perfectly flat it is going to sit

881
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,000
at a little angle

882
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,839
it does make it a little easier to read

883
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,319
so we're not going to worry about it

884
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,000
being perfectly flat we are going to

885
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,839
follow the same kind of practice that

886
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,040
we've done

887
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,160
with our leds however

888
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,359
and we're only going to do one pin

889
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,800
and let me get that so that it's in both

890
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,839
screens maybe

891
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,119
there we go

892
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,000
now we can see it and we can see it in

893
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,480
the magnified view in the corner

894
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,680
so we're just going to do one pin

895
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,839
just like we did on our leds

896
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,079
let it cool flip it over

897
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,640
and as you can see mine is way too high

898
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,000
so just like our leds i'm going to

899
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,440
hold it in my left hand

900
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,480
heat that pin up again with my right and

901
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:28,750
just apply a little pressure

902
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,940
[Music]

903
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,040
and now that we can check that it's yeah

904
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,680
it's reasonably

905
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,400
where we want it we'll go ahead and

906
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,240
solder up those other three pins

907
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,839
and now we can solder up the other three

908
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,839
pins

909
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,760
there's one

910
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,400
there's two

911
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,920
and there's three

912
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,839
and clean the iron

913
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,520
and then just to give everybody a little

914
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,800
extra time

915
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,440
um i'm gonna take a second and talk

916
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,200
about this stuff here

917
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,240
um as you solder you're gonna see

918
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,799
you're going to see that it leaves a

919
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,960
kind of gooey residue

920
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,960
on the back on the back of your board on

921
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,480
the solder joints

922
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,720
this is the flux that's in the middle of

923
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,000
your piece of solder um

924
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,520
your solder is basically if we

925
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,880
use this sharpie

926
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,240
maybe as kind of a model

927
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,520
if we find the tip there we go on this

928
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,799
example

929
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,960
if this was your flux or if this was

930
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,119
your solder it works the same way

931
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,480
the plastic casing is the actual metal

932
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,680
and then the felt part in the middle

933
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,520
is actually um fox flux which is

934
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,079
um a a mixture of tree resins

935
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,520
to help the flutter so the solder flow

936
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,359
better

937
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,160
uh all those all those years in speech

938
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,880
therapy

939
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,359
still not great all right

940
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,480
so let's flip back to the wide view here

941
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
and with this one we are going to take

942
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,079
the extra

943
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,280
pins and just because i don't want these

944
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,640
all over my house you're not going to

945
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,319
see it

946
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,960
but there we go clippy clippy

947
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,799
[Music]

948
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,079
what is the screen going to do well

949
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,359
it says supernatural 6 and the reason it

950
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,640
says supernatural 6

951
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,240
is because well that's kind of

952
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,720
breaking all kinds of copyright issues

953
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,160
but this was my inspiration

954
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,760
so the screen is going to light up with

955
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,359
text

956
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,400
that says things like the supernatural 6

957
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:24,799
ball

958
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,510
says backups what backups

959
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,839
[Music]

960
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,520
or other things like

961
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,079
needs director level approval here is

962
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,359
actually a finished one

963
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,119
as long as we're taking a minute to make

964
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,040
sure that everybody is in the exact same

965
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,640
place

966
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,280
this is the finished this is what will

967
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,119
happen when it's finished

968
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,559
and then if you hit the white button

969
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,720
the screen actually comes up with a

970
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,640
different fortune

971
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,640
this is my favorite i don't know if you

972
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,400
can read it real well

973
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,000
um it says squirrels um

974
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
i was i did work um help desk for an isp

975
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,960
for a while

976
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,880
we had one gentleman who really liked

977
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,640
our service liked our people

978
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,799
but we were out there replacing the drop

979
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,480
to his house every couple of years

980
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,280
because

981
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,640
there were some squirrels that had

982
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,839
gotten the taste for the line

983
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,119
and so they would chew on it

984
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,760
all right is everybody caught is

985
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,520
everybody caught up everything

986
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,680
on the front is done except for matt who

987
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,119
i know we have to help

988
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,520
get his resistors sorted out in during

989
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,000
the next session

990
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,079
okay so now we're going to flip it over

991
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,119
and move it into screen because

992
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,240
all right so this is the back side

993
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,240
um this is where our pi pico is going to

994
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,000
go

995
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,680
um i did go ahead um and silk screen on

996
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,880
what everything is

997
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,960
in addition you'll know you'll notice on

998
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,559
the front that there were some pins that

999
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,079
we didn't use

1000
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,200
um those actually will lead back back if

1001
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,799
you want to add your own component

1002
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,000
like a buzzer or another led

1003
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,839
or if you want to try running some

1004
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,079
neopixels

1005
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,559
um pic pixels this thing does have an

1006
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,079
internal temperature

1007
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,240
sensor you could you know switch it over

1008
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,359
to

1009
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,160
to kind of a room thermometer those

1010
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,040
kinds of things

1011
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,240
things and

1012
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,960
we'll give secure another moment here

1013
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,559
because now you're going to have to make

1014
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,200
a choice

1015
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,359
and your choice is going to be as

1016
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,000
follows i sent along

1017
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,640
two kinds of pin headers these are

1018
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,200
female

1019
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,919
these are male

1020
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,680
and the reason i did that was because

1021
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,000
these

1022
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,680
boards are new and quantities are

1023
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,240
limited like everything else in

1024
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,720
in technology right now although they

1025
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,160
rolled their own silicone it helps

1026
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,559
you have the option to set this up to be

1027
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,079
able to take the pie pico

1028
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,359
off of here and use it on a breadboard

1029
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,920
um so if you want to do that we're going

1030
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,599
to start with the female headers

1031
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,559
we're going to put the female headers

1032
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,359
into the board

1033
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,680
and then solder them if you want to

1034
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,480
leave this permanent because let's face

1035
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,920
it these guys are only four bucks a

1036
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,599
piece and they are starting to come back

1037
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,119
into stock

1038
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,359
in all the usual places digikey adafruit

1039
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,839
etc we can make it permanent by using

1040
00:59:53,839 --> 01:00:00,240
just the mail headers so

1041
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,200
for reasons of practice i would say

1042
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,839
let's

1043
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,319
use the i'm going to use the female

1044
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,880
headers in the demo

1045
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,240
so we start with one strip

1046
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,920
either side and you want to make sure

1047
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,839
that it is lined up that you don't have

1048
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,119
any extra holes

1049
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,319
nope okay good and then just like our

1050
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,079
friendly leds

1051
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,520
and screen and everything else

1052
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,079
we're gonna do one pin and one pin only

1053
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,040
so that we can reflow it

1054
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,319
yeah let's see if i get that yeah i did

1055
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,000
get that okay

1056
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,480
okay i got it but as you can see it's up

1057
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,880
and crooked and all those things

1058
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,640
which is why we do one pin only

1059
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,520
so that we can reflow the solder that's

1060
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,359
there

1061
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,480
and make sure that it's square

1062
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,000
and even

1063
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:25,839
and flush with the board

1064
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:39,839
and so this is the practice part

1065
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,520
let me go ahead

1066
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,240
and we'll get you lots and lots of

1067
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,359
soldering practice

1068
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,799
on pin headers

1069
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,920
because this is actually these days

1070
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,400
going to be your most common task

1071
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,079
if you're soldering something um

1072
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,039
usually it's adding a screen a

1073
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:09,039
microcontroller

1074
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,079
or whatever um to a piece of proto board

1075
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:21,839
or a custom pcb

1076
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,839
and we just go right down the line

1077
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:49,839
one by one

1078
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,400
buy one

1079
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,000
buy one

1080
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,280
and that's all of them and so i'm going

1081
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,799
to

1082
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,720
lift this up and kind of visually

1083
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:30,720
inspect it myself

1084
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,799
and all of these are okay um

1085
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,559
this is a toy to sit on your desk at

1086
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,880
work and say here see what i made

1087
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,640
um it's not going to mars so

1088
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,839
i'm going to call all of these

1089
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:48,240
acceptable technically

1090
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,119
if this was going to mars this one here

1091
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,039
has a little too little solder

1092
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,920
and that one had there has a bit much

1093
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,920
but for this kind of job

1094
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,119
we're okay and let me flip over to the

1095
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,640
magnified view

1096
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,480
so again so you can see what i'm talking

1097
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:13,839
about and it's the

1098
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and the third and you can see the third

1099
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,839
one has a little less solder and some

1100
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,520
have a little more um we're doing the

1101
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,880
female headers

1102
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,200
which are the which are these guys here

1103
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,200
um that's because raspberry pi picos are

1104
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,640
new and i want you to be able to

1105
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,640
experiment with them later

1106
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,240
um if you don't think you're going to

1107
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,000
experiment with the laters you can skip

1108
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,720
ahead

1109
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,640
and just use the mail headers on both

1110
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,960
sides

1111
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,839
[Music]

1112
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,359
so we're going to take our other female

1113
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:55,440
header here

1114
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,760
and this one should be a lot easier to

1115
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,680
get right because we're not dealing with

1116
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,558
a tippy board

1117
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,440
it's actually got some balance to it now

1118
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,079
on site two that doesn't mean that i'm

1119
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:10,960
not going to do

1120
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:24,400
just one pin just to check the fit

1121
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,280
because as you can see the one that i'm

1122
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,000
starting on

1123
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,280
it's bent so let's get that corrected

1124
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,839
before we do the rest

1125
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,160
and there we go now we're neat and even

1126
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,880
and can flip it over and do the rest yep

1127
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,079
we're good there

1128
01:05:50,079 --> 01:06:04,079
so we'll just get that in frame

1129
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,520
over to our magnified view

1130
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,520
and just keep going

1131
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,038
and these are no different

1132
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,000
then say your resistors or your leds at

1133
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,599
the end of the day

1134
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,839
um

1135
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,799
or just trying to fill up the gap

1136
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,599
between the little leg on the part

1137
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,880
and the hole that it sits in with metal

1138
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,720
so that we can make the electrons flow

1139
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,240
and we've got another one there

1140
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:59,850
another there

1141
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:03,110
[Music]

1142
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,400
and we just keep going

1143
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,119
lots and lots of practice with

1144
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,280
through-hole joinery

1145
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,280
when you have to do lots and lots of pin

1146
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,839
headers

1147
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:40,000
there we go

1148
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,720
and once again we'll check these out

1149
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,359
pretty good

1150
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,920
that looks really good

1151
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,839
back to wide view

1152
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,359
give everybody a minute

1153
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,720
or two to catch up um like i was saying

1154
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,480
you're going to see feel a little goo

1155
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,479
that's flux um rubbing alcohol

1156
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,319
um a little soap and water with the pie

1157
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,479
with the pie pico removed um

1158
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,920
if you're really really into it an

1159
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,960
ultrasonic cleaner

1160
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,839
um but for something like this

1161
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:45,040
rubbing alcohol um

1162
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,560
70 or better is fine um

1163
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,880
you're going to want to use a something

1164
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,960
that doesn't have something not super

1165
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,759
fibery

1166
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,399
so i would use like a paper towel versus

1167
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,198
say a q-tip

1168
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,279
you just want to get that off of there

1169
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,480
otherwise it can oxidize

1170
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,600
you can always yes you can always catch

1171
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,640
catch

1172
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,399
catch up with the video recordings and

1173
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,880
relive the beautiful moments

1174
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,679
thank you that is sweet all right so

1175
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:21,679
we've got our female headers

1176
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,238
and we've got our pi pico

1177
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,479
now

1178
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,719
everybody has a different way of doing

1179
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,158
pin it headers

1180
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:40,960
on a board some people

1181
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,640
use a breadboard they will lock the

1182
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,679
headers into a breadboard

1183
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,600
and then put the picot on top

1184
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,279
now we could do these like we did the

1185
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,080
female header

1186
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,239
[Music]

1187
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,280
and just do one and

1188
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,000
go forth we're going to cheat a little

1189
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,320
and kind of do a hybrid thing

1190
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,840
so go ahead and take the male header

1191
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,239
pins

1192
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,640
and make sure that they're flat with the

1193
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,840
female part of the board

1194
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,239
and we want to put the long ends

1195
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,679
down into the female headers

1196
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,239
and leave the short spikes so that we

1197
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,360
don't have to trim them

1198
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,920
on the top

1199
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,080
and then if our female headers are good

1200
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,080
and our male headers are good

1201
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,199
this guy should with a little wiggling

1202
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:52,559
just drop right into place

1203
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,840
[Music]

1204
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,320
and

1205
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,080
as you can see without any solder it's

1206
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,440
already flat

1207
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,519
it's there we're golden

1208
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,719
so at this point um it is 10 after one

1209
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,560
um sorry i just ran a little long

1210
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,600
um well and so we'll just go ahead and

1211
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,880
start soldering these

1212
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,840
same as before

1213
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,679
um the only difference with these joints

1214
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,600
as opposed to some of our others

1215
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,000
is you do not need to completely cover

1216
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,360
this pad

1217
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,960
with solder these were these boards were

1218
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,679
designed

1219
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,960
as kind of a hybrid model we could do

1220
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,640
use them as a surface mount thing

1221
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,840
or we can use them as a through-hole

1222
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,840
thing

1223
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,199
so the pads for the pins actually extend

1224
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:00,560
down the side

1225
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,719
and then if we were doing this as a um

1226
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,840
as a surface mount let me grab

1227
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,600
we could actually just put a little dip

1228
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,040
of solder

1229
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,239
here in this notch

1230
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,440
and we'd get a connection to a plain pad

1231
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,400
short pin short pins go up because you

1232
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,080
don't want to have to try to

1233
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,360
get in in on this board with

1234
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,920
your cutting tool to try to make them

1235
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,239
short

1236
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,760
so the long pins should be filling up

1237
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,840
the

1238
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,199
well there's more than plastic in there

1239
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,000
but the long pins should fit in

1240
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,880
to the female header and go all the way

1241
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,120
down

1242
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,360
so if we look with this extra strip that

1243
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,520
i have handy

1244
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,719
the short side is up and going into the

1245
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:05,840
pie picot

1246
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,159
matt i really really want to see a

1247
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,600
picture of your board man

1248
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,960
i really do so

1249
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,400
um think of this as like an inside view

1250
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,840
we've got the short legs

1251
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,960
pointing up to the picot long legs down

1252
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,400
okay so

1253
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:33,839
we'll just continue on

1254
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,640
[Music]

1255
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,679
these guys and

1256
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,520
if you need to go basically this is the

1257
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,520
last step

1258
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,440
if you want to stay and ask a few more

1259
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,280
questions

1260
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,199
i'll be logging off a little bit for a

1261
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,800
little bit here

1262
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,840
here in about 10 minutes

1263
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,960
so just keep practicing

1264
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,170
this up and over

1265
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:17,279
[Music]

1266
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,719
well good for her that's what we like to

1267
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,880
see

1268
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,840
here

1269
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,440
do some over here in the magnified view

1270
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,839
if i can get a good angle

1271
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,679
or not

1272
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:11,839
make sure the iron's clean

1273
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,600
and yeah even i can't do it perfectly

1274
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,400
all the time

1275
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,840
i wonder okay

1276
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,840
um

1277
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,600
uh

1278
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,760
so i'll go ahead and finish this later

1279
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,679
does anybody have any more

1280
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,560
any other questions any other any other

1281
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,760
concerns

1282
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,520
uh we can talk about it more where you

1283
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,199
guys can take over the

1284
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:49,839

okay uh

1289
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,000
matt the pie pico's don't have any code

1290
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,890
in them right now

[Music]

1292
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,159
trying to remember if they actually do

1293
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,239
do uh

1294
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:20,320
demo plug this one in

1295
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,840
so yeah these boards

1296
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,320
don't have i don't remember if they have

1297
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,400
any code in them or not

1298
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,000
um not

1299
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,640
um you might have to wait for tomorrow's

1300
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,840
session where we

1301
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,320
actually do the code um

1302
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,360
code um as far as getting power

1303
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,080
i keep resetting the damn thing um as

1304
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,320
far as getting power um

1305
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,520
there's usb they are usb here let me

1306
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,000
flip over

1307
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,159
they are just usb powered um

1308
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:11,199
i do have a session planned where i can

1309
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,040
show you how

1310
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,320
where we can talk about what kind of

1311
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,120
batteries they need

1312
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,040
and that but yeah they shouldn't really

1313
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,960
be doing anything right now

1314
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,800
um if you want to um

1315
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,679
the female pins were short down um the

1316
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,520
holes for the female pins should be

1317
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,719
pointing at the back of the board

1318
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,080
if you want to work ahead you can head

1319
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:38,800
over to

1320
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,640
my blog let me pull that page up

1321
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,520
in fact i'll just spam chat here again

1322

1324
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,280
so there's a link here um

1325
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,880
it's my blog it didn't get moved over

1326
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,000
because our web lady had other things

1327
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,280
many many things to do

1328
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,040
beforehand there really isn't any code

1329
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,000
on these

1330
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
these um i shipped them out direct from

1331
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,360
the manufacturer

1332
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,040
so no it's not going to do anything

1333
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,120
until after tomorrow's session

1334
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,640
otherwise there is instructions

1335
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,239
and the code that i used on my blog

1336
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:37,839
if you want to work on it tonight

1337
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:51,840
but yeah they are just usb powered

1338
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,800
and uh please if you enjoyed this um

1339
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,360
and have and are thinking about

1340
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,199
attending next year when we are

1341
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:04,239
hopefully again in person please do take

1342
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:04,800
that two

1343
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,360
questions survey that was also in what i

1344
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,280
just spammed to chat

1345
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,080
i'm trying to make this more of a

1346
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,480
maker's village and not necessarily a

1347
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,599
soldering village

1348
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,080
village because i think that um you know

1349
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,840
everybody needs a hobby everybody needs

1350
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,320
to have

1351
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,280
have a way to relax and you know this

1352
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,960
isn't going to do it for some people and

1353
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,040
it does it for others so

1354
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,320
um i do do a lot of different crafts and

1355
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,239
and would be more than happy to to

1356
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,800
expand what i teach

1357
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:47,840
at the village

1358
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,400

1405
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,400
minutes so that you all can answer

1406
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,120
questions

1407
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,520
and we can all kind of stick together as

1408
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,880
far as

1409
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,450

1411
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,120
is there anything else that you wanted

1412
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:45,840
another look at matt

1413
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,840
okay good

1414
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,920
you

1415
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,920
you

1416
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,840
huh

1417
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:33,840
all right

1418
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,360
let's see so nobody has any questions

1419
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,360
let's build a random thing

1420
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,960
um this is a three triple a battery

1421
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,639
holder so it's gonna put out about four

1422
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,280
and a half volts

1423
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,560
so how many how many leds can chris put

1424
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,440
in in parallel

1425
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,800
and make a cheesy flashlight

1426
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,840
after dark

1427
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,920
5.5

1428
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,840

[Music]

1430
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:04,960
okay

1431
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,719
so 110 fine be that way

1432
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,239
all right so we're gonna take big blue

1433
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,040
and power them with three triple a's on

1434
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:31,840
this piece of perf board

1435
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,840
so just straight up power and led

1436
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:54,639
we're gonna add an led to our proto

1437
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,840
board

1438
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,520
oops let's turn that sideways this is

1439
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,840
not perfect

1440
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,199
basically a solderable breadboard so we

1441
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,919
got big blue

1442
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,840
one here

1443
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:41,840
there wow that's old

1444
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:09,839
all right everything said 120.

1445
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,840
so

1446
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,840
okay

so what i'm playing with right now is

1469
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,040
basically just a simple light circuit um

1470
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,840
goes from here

1471
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,679
normally four and a half volts to

1472
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,760
our light let's see if i can grab an

1473
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,560
extra button

1474
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:58,159
or something to make it a little more

1475
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,350
interesting

1476

[Music]

1477
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,760
um not demo but what is a good starter

1478
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,840
project to teach my daughter to solder

1479
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,960
um

1480
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,000
probably the way i learned um

1481
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:10,080
was through kits um

1482
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,159
i'm trying to remember the name the

1483
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,239
brand name off hand

1484
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:17,679
but if you look um

1485
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,880
on amazon and other places um

1486
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,080
you can find soldering kits um i want to

1487
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:24,960
say

1488
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,560
elko or enco um

1489
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,880
makes different kits where you end up

1490
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,960
with little things like

1491
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,960
um with like radios

1492
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,000
or um somebody sent me this guy

1493
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,560
to review he was pretty simple

1494
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,760
simple to do but that's probably the

1495
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,480
best way is to find a small

1496
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:58,400
kit or a small project on

1497
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,719
um

1498
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,719
on instructables this is actually if it

1499
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:05,600
works

1500
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,800
when it works it works it's like

1501
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,760
it's sound activated lights so that was

1502
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:12,639
a fun kit

1503
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:15,760
um they sent it to me to review

1504
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,760
um probably not something i'd go

1505
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,280
normally and get myself but

1506
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:25,280
it was fun um

1507
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,559
so i know there's

1508
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,840
pull up my friend here

1509
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:14,719
um today is another good resource

1510
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,840
um i just did a quick amazon search on

1511
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,000
learn to solder kits

1512
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,280
and it's coming up with like some

1513
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:24,480
blinkies and

1624
02:15:11,199 --> 02:15:14,560

[Music]

1630
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:41,360
hey guys just checking to see if anyone

1631
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:42,000
can hear

1632
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,239
while we wait for our next presenter in

1633
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:45,920
46 minutes

1634
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:48,239
my camera is not as good as chris but

1635
02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:49,280
i'm going to

1636
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:52,239
work on something i'm soldering which is

1637
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:53,280
uh this is a

1638
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:56,000
geiger counter kit from rh electronics

1639
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,280
let's see if i can get in front of the

1640
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:59,360
camera

1641
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,800
so i built this one previously

1642
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:06,239
and then we've got this kit here

1643
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:10,000
we can build so these are pretty simple

1644
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:10,560
to do

1645
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:12,719
they're almost all through-hull there's

1646
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:14,320
really no service mount the surface

1647
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,239
mount stuff he

1648
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:19,360
he does ahead of time so

1649
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,360
you don't have to worry about doing that

1650
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,440
if you're scared of doing surface mounts

1651
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,960
so i'll show you the board here real

1652
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,280
quick

1653
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:32,240
so let's see the board there it's pretty

1654
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:32,558
much

1655
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:34,478
all through-hole there's some surface

1656
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:37,920
mount stuff for the voltage controller

1657
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:42,398
but nothing too difficult

1658
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:45,040
so i've just got a little pair of

1659
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,679
helping hands here

1660
02:16:47,679 --> 02:17:01,840

1661
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:07,599

things like this where it's tweezers but

1683
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:11,760
they lock

1684
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:14,478
rather than staying open make it a

1685
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:15,920
little easier to hold things while

1686
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,478
you're doing it

1687
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:23,840
this one came in one of my hacker

1688
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,519
if you want to check them out hacker

1689
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:27,359
boxes is online it's run by one of the

1690
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:29,200
defcon guys

1691
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,478
really fun little kits every month so

1692
02:18:32,478 --> 02:18:32,879
let's

1693
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:39,679
dump out these components

1694
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,799
so we'll start with the buzzer

1695
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:45,840
it's the easiest one

1696
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:50,840
so let's see which one of these is

1697
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:52,959
positive

1698
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:56,000
this little buzzer

1699
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:00,558
see how my previous one looks it doesn't

1700
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:04,240
really tell you which pins are which

1701
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:08,318
okay looks like the label

1702
02:19:08,318 --> 02:19:11,840
has to be facing that way

1703
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,040
on the top of the buzzer so i'm gonna

1704
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:17,760
remove this

1705
02:19:18,398 --> 02:19:21,840
i'm gonna get those lined up

1706
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:34,808
drop some solder on there

1707
02:19:34,808 --> 02:19:40,089
[Music]

1708
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:49,840
um

1709
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:14,840
let's see let's see what we can put on

1710
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:17,350
next

1711
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:20,160
[Music]

1712
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:23,760
you can find the led in here

1713
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,560
the switch switch is a good start switch

1714
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:29,280
goes right here

1715
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:32,160
so you can see it's silk screened let's

1716
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:35,520
see if again from the camera

1717
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:42,160
flip those over so

1718
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,160
sometimes what i do is i'll take like

1719
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,479
say you want this thing to stay on

1720
02:20:46,479 --> 02:20:48,319
i'll take some tweezers that'll lock

1721
02:20:48,319 --> 02:20:50,000
clothes like that use them to lock them

1722
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:59,270
in place

1723
02:20:59,270 --> 02:21:02,459
[Music]

1724
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:13,840
awesome

1725
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,240
now that we got one solder you can take

1726
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:26,319
these off

1727
02:21:26,319 --> 02:21:41,840
put them back on our cup for later

1728
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:46,160
so stuff like switches sometimes a

1729
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:47,680
little harder to solder because they

1730
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,120
have a lot of metal

1731
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:51,280
to sink the heat away from your

1732
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:52,720
soldering iron

1733
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:54,560
so it can be a little bit of a pain

1734
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,399
you've got to get that metal

1735
02:21:56,399 --> 02:21:58,560
a little hotter to get the solder to

1736
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,960
join

1737
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:03,840
but you also want to make sure um might

1738
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,240
have a bridge there

1739
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,880
we don't want that so let's see if we

1740
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:11,039
can

1741
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:15,920
so especially with things that are

1742
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:17,600
really close together

1743
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:19,600
like you can see that switch and there's

1744
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:22,319
a resistor right there

1745
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:25,439
yeah they might be bridged that's when

1746
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:26,720
you got to pull out something like a

1747
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,920
jeweler's loop

1748
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,280
to really take a look at it

1749
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:33,200
see if i can find some of my jeweler's

1750
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:37,840
loops here

1751
02:22:42,319 --> 02:22:43,840
see if we can steal one of the lenses

1752
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:45,680
off this guy and use it on the camera

1753
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:48,840
so you guys can see what i'm talking

1754
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:51,439
about

1755
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:54,000
so let's see

1756
02:22:58,890 --> 02:23:02,029
[Music]

1757
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:05,840
then

1758
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,439
kind of difficult to do with the camera

1759
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:12,000
sorry guys

1760
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:15,600
but what we're looking for is you can

1761
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:19,040
kind of see it's a little

1762
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:20,960
a pool of solder is a little closer to

1763
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:23,280
that resistor that we want

1764
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:27,120
so we might use our desoldering wick

1765
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,359
and take some of that away so that we

1766
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:33,680
don't risk having a problem

1767
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:37,520
or where's my desoldering vacuum

1768
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:40,399
somewhere over here

1769
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:47,840
wick or vacuum

1770
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,359
just get the solder flowing again

1771
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:15,840
let's see

1772
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:27,840
yeah that should be good for now so we

1773
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,680
can finish soldering that switch in

1774
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:40,840
[Music]

1775
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:43,840
place

1776
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:57,840
okay

1777
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,840
okay

1778
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,399
let's try a different camera here in a

1779
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:20,240
sec because this one's kind of too far

1780
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:25,840
away

1781
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:39,280
so we soldered the switch on now

1782
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,200
so let's see what we can do next so

1783
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:42,640
there's the led

1784
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:45,280
so remember check your polarity there's

1785
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,040
two ways to do that

1786
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:52,640
it's the length of the legs

1787
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,399
so with leds you can either check the

1788
02:25:54,399 --> 02:25:55,840
length of the legs

1789
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:58,960
or there's a little

1790
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:02,319
cut out flat point on one of the

1791
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:05,359
side of the leds

1792
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:09,040
so let's see if we can not the greatest

1793
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,640
camera

1794
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:13,200
honestly the camera probably would be

1795
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,640
better

1796
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:21,840
let's try that real quick

1797
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:26,640
okay hello everyone all right

1798
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:32,160
um this is the supernatural six build

1799
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:35,040
um bill this is the second

1800
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:36,880
session of this today so yeah we are

1801
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:38,640
going to do it again

1802
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:41,600
uh my name's chris um i've been doing

1803
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,040
this for a long time

1804
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:46,080
um um i've ran

1805
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:49,040
i ran the in-person village and come up

1806
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,200
with some of the projects for here

1807
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,319
as well um

1808
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:56,399
i do want to give a shout out to our

1809
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:58,399
diamond and platinum sponsors

1810
02:26:58,399 --> 02:27:00,800
um our diamond sponsors ine elearn

and bridge crew thanks guys um

1816
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:15,920
no they do do a lot for us most of the

1817
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:17,520
stuff for this village was paid

1818
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:19,840
for through the kits so thank you to you

1819
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:21,359
all as well

1820
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:26,319
um and so we'll go ahead and get started

1821
02:27:26,319 --> 02:27:29,280
just as a matter of kind of housekeeping

1822
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,399
um

1823
02:27:30,399 --> 02:27:31,520
one of the things i get a lot of

1824
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:33,439
question on is

1825
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:38,479
if i flip over to our build view maybe

1826
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:44,000
finally

1827
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,800
find the right shot here there we go

1828
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:48,399
flip over to the build view

1829
02:27:48,399 --> 02:27:52,000
um in addition to my soldering iron

1830
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,920
and our soldering iron should always be

1831
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:56,080
super duper shiny

1832
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:59,439
at the tip where it matters

1833
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:02,319
um you will also see some other tools

1834
02:28:02,319 --> 02:28:04,080
come into view and i just wanted to kind

1835
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,680
of let you know what they were

1836
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:10,880
um this is a resistor bender

1837
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:14,000
um i got this one a long time ago i

1838
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:14,479
actually

1839
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:17,200
inherited it um to give you some idea

1840
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:17,520
this

1841
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:21,680
is radio shack red and what it does is

1842
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:22,640
that

1843
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:25,920
you can use it to make your just look a

1844
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:27,760
little more nice

1845
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:31,280
other things you might see coming in um

1846
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:33,920
obviously angle cutters because let's

1847
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:34,960
face it

1848
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:36,800
we're not going to use all of this

1849
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,840
soldering in

1850
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:42,800
um this is uh

1851
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:45,840
how i clean my iron it's um

1852
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:50,080
it's basically like a brass scrubby pad

1853
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:54,960
i buy them in bulk

1854
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:59,120
bulk um so basically the idea is that

1855
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:01,280
um instead of using a wet piece of

1856
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,800
sponge to clean my otter

1857
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:05,600
my soldering iron i like the brass um

1858
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:07,120
because if you're traveling you don't

1859
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:10,080
have to worry about a sponge

1860
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:11,680
also it's a little easier on your

1861
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:14,399
soldering tips because you're not

1862
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:16,000
once you're up to temperature you're not

1863
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,840
shocking the tip every time you wipe it

1864
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,359
on

1865
02:29:19,359 --> 02:29:21,280
on a wet sponge i'm not saying that you

1866
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,720
shouldn't i'm just saying i like this

1867
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,479
better

1868
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:27,840
um tutors

1869
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,120
old help me see we'll put those on now

1870
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:31,840
and

1871
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,680
no i'm not turning on back on the other

1872
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,000
camera where you can see my head

1873
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,359
oh let's see oh

1874
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:43,040
very good steven thank you

1875
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,040
and let's see what else okay you might

1876
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,479
see this um

1877
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:53,040
i usually pull this out once a session

1878
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,080
because

1879
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:56,080
somebody will ask how to desolder this

1880
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:59,120
is a solder sucker

1881
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:03,520
you depress the plunger hit the button

1882
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,920
and it basically creates a small vacuum

1883
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,560
just enough to pull some excess solder

1884
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:13,199
off the board

1885
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:17,680
i also use solder wick

1886
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:19,359
good thing to have on hand if you plan

1887
02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:20,720
to do more soldering

1888
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:24,319
i'll definitely recommend i prefer this

1889
02:30:24,319 --> 02:30:25,439
brand

1890
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:28,800
it's a japanese brand and it's kind of

1891
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,840
awesome

1892
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:33,920
um i actually got a blob on my pi pico

1893
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,280
from the first build session

1894
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:37,520
and was able to remove it with that

1895
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:40,319
stuff all right

1896
02:30:40,479 --> 02:30:41,920
all right so let's go ahead and get

1897
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:44,840
started um we're going to start

1898
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:47,760
with

1899
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:50,080
resistor one and resistor two and the

1900
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:51,040
reason we start

1901
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:55,600
with resistors is that if you think of

1902
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:58,880
your board on this flat plane

1903
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:02,640
you want to build it up in increments so

1904
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,479
we want to be able to

1905
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:06,479
keep all of our resistors flat against

1906
02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:09,040
the table so we'll put those on first

1907
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:10,880
and then our leds are going to be taller

1908
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:12,560
so we'll do them next

1909
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,240
and then the buttons and so on and so

1910
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,479
forth

1911
02:31:16,479 --> 02:31:18,560
later we'll have much fun with solder

1912
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:20,880
pins

1913
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,560
all right so let's do we're going to do

1914
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:27,520
resistor 1 resistor 2 these are 10 ohm

1915
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:30,160
resistors

1916
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:34,000
if anybody has been reading any

1917
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,880
pi pico documentation they say 220

1918
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:41,200
um i don't know where they got the 220

1919
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:43,040
from

1920
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:45,760
for their resistors when i do the math

1921
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:46,319
using

1922
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:50,080
standard 2.2 volt resistors

1923
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:53,840
and 3.2 volt resistor or

1924
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:57,359
leds wow it's been a long day um

1925
02:31:57,359 --> 02:31:59,760
the mask is telling me to use what i

1926
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:02,000
what i put in the kit which was

1927
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,120
10 ohm for the blue and 68 ohm for the

1928
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,800
rest

1929
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:10,000
so we've got our two resistors we've

1930
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:10,640
bent them up

1931
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:14,000
we've put them in the holes make sure

1932
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,840
they are flat to the board

1933
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:18,080
and you can bend the leg the rear legs

1934
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:20,720
out a little bit

1935
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:25,439
to help hold them in place and then

1936
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:27,760
when we go to solder first thing we do

1937
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:29,600
is we check our iron make sure it's

1938
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:31,439
shiny shiny shiny

1939
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:38,880
and if not give it a quick clean

1940
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:41,040
if it's a new iron i recommend tinning

1941
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:43,840
it which is basically we're just gonna

1942
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,800
put a little solder everywhere and then

1943
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,519
clean that off

1944
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:55,840
lightly okay so for these first couples

1945
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:58,720
let me pull up the

1946
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:01,920
let's get into

1947
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:07,600
our magnified view here

1948
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,600
and we'll switch over to the magnified

1949
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,840
view

1950
02:33:16,319 --> 02:33:17,760
hey which side are we doing here okay

1951
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:21,840
we're down the side

1952
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:33,680
[Music]

1953
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:37,359
all right and so

1954
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:39,200
we take our soldering iron and we hold

1955
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:41,120
the

1956
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:44,399
part in the pad and you just want to

1957
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:44,960
give it a

1958
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,160
couple of seconds to make sure

1959
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:48,319
everything's good and hot

1960
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:51,680
okay actually one second

1961
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:56,319
maybe two all depends

1962
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:01,040
so it's basically hold tap

1963
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:04,080
remove and you're done

1964
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,240
and what we're looking for with a good

1965
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:09,039
solder joint

1966
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:11,760
i don't know how well you call it see

1967
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:13,680
that maybe there we go

1968
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,040
is we're looking for a shape like a

1969
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,840
hershey's kiss

1970
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:21,439
it should be it should be kind of a cone

1971
02:34:21,439 --> 02:34:23,600
shape

1972
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:27,120
with the leg being the pattern

1973
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:31,680
and then if we look at the front

1974
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,520
maybe look at the front there we go and

1975
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,120
then if we look at the front the holes

1976
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,720
all the way filled in in fact i got a

1977
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,240
little bulging out

1978
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:41,359
on either side so that's

1979
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:45,359
so that's a good way to do that and then

1980
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:46,640
we'll do the other one here on

1981
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:49,280
magnification

1982
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:53,439
if i can get it centered or lined up

1983
02:34:56,800 --> 02:35:01,439
there we go so here's the other 10

1984
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:04,319
ohm resistor

1985
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:08,319
and we'll just heat that up

1986
02:35:10,319 --> 02:35:15,920
and down and then the next

1987
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:21,600
okay and now that these are done

1988
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:27,840
go ahead and take our clippers

1989
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:41,840
and get rid of the extra

1990
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:44,800
and do try to hold on to what you're

1991
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,960
trying to clip off of the board

1992
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:48,800
when you're clipping it off um just

1993
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:50,080
because

1994
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:53,520
otherwise you end up with little tiny

1995
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,160
ish

1996
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:59,520
incredibly sharp bits of metal

1997
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,880
like that um

1998
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:07,520
in your carpet or on your floor and

1999
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:11,840
if you've and trust me if

2000
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:14,000
you've ever stepped on a lego stepping

2001
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,359
on something like that

2002
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:19,359
is about a billion times worse yes

2003
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:21,680
because those do draw blood so yeah you

2004
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:24,080
do want to keep track of your excess

2005
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:27,600
your excess bits legs from resistors or

2006
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:29,200
leds or

2007
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:32,319
or errant

2008
02:36:32,319 --> 02:36:36,160
pins surface mount stuff you'll never

2009
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,560
ever see again if it goes on the floor

2010
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:41,520
um that's just an immediate law of the

2011
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:42,720
universe

2012
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:46,560
um so don't worry about that too much

2013
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:47,920
so we're going to go ahead and do the

2014
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:50,080
rest of the resistors

2015
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:52,000
and that was the four pack included in

2016
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,560
your kit

2017
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:05,680
and i'll just bend this last one here by

2018
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:06,640
hand

2019
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:19,840
just to give you some idea

2020
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:22,080
all right so there's our resistors all

2021
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:23,760
bent and ready to put in

2022
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:27,040
and these are going to go in r3 r4 r5

2023
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,760
and r6

2024
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:32,800
and resistors are not polarized which

2025
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:36,240
means that it doesn't matter

2026
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:38,479
[Music]

2027
02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:40,319
i can put it like this with the gold

2028
02:37:40,319 --> 02:37:42,399
towards the center

2029
02:37:42,399 --> 02:37:44,160
or i can put it like that with the gold

2030
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:47,359
towards the outside

2031
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:51,040
if you want to have them a certain way

2032
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:54,640
for aesthetic reasons that's cool it's

2033
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:56,240
kind of handy

2034
02:37:56,240 --> 02:38:00,000
but it really isn't that

2035
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,200
important that they all point the same

2036
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:05,760
direction

2037
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:10,720
there's no positive no negative they're

2038
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:15,040
not polarized

2039
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,280
so let's go ahead bend those out just a

2040
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:20,640
little bit to make sure they stay

2041
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:29,840
and we'll go ahead and solder these

2042
02:38:51,210 --> 02:38:55,289
[Music]

2043
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:05,680
all right so that's the resistors

2044
02:39:06,479 --> 02:39:08,479
and like i said when you clip make sure

2045
02:39:08,479 --> 02:39:09,680
you

2046
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:12,399
think and yeah i i do have a magnet that

2047
02:39:12,399 --> 02:39:13,760
i've used

2048
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:17,920
on occasion um

2049
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:25,439
mostly to clean up the old desk

2050
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:28,399
usually for cleanup

2051
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:32,399
i'm doing everything a hundred percent

2052
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:35,599
the way i'm supposed to be

2053
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:39,040
i found a little tiny trash can at the

2054
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,600
dollar tree

2055
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:49,680
so go ahead um

2056
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:55,359
let's go ahead and go ahead and do a

2057
02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:56,560
ready check here

2058
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:58,800
if you're all done soldering all six

2059
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:01,840
resistors go ahead and give me a k

2060
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:05,439
or a smiley face or emoji or

2061
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:07,840
whatever else in the chat and then we'll

2062
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:21,840
move on to the leds

2063
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:33,040
okay so we're going to move on to the

2064
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,840
leds and

2065
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:42,960
apparently i am missing one

2066
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,240
okay i miss counted when i when i bend

2067
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:48,160
this up to

2068
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,399
make it easy so let me just fight with

2069
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:53,439
some plastic here

2070
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:00,840
yeah fine with the plastic press the

2071
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:02,240
blues

2072
02:41:02,240 --> 02:41:06,160
extra blue okay

2073
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:09,439
so we've got our two blue leds um

2074
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,720
now unlike our resistors leds do have a

2075
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:17,840
right and a wrong way to go in the board

2076
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:23,600
it's not the easiest to see but you will

2077
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:26,080
definitely feel it

2078
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:28,399
there is a flat spot in the bottom ring

2079
02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:30,640
on an led

2080
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:32,560
and also one leg is longer than the

2081
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:34,160
other

2082
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:37,760
so to match what's on the silk screen

2083
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:39,359
we want to make sure that that flat

2084
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:41,680
notch and the short leg

2085
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:45,840
are in the bottom hole

2086
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:49,240
and that's on led one and two

2087
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:53,770
[Music]

2088
02:41:57,279 --> 02:42:00,399
so short leg flat spot matches the flat

2089
02:42:00,399 --> 02:42:03,840
spot in the silk screen

2090
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:06,319
and so we're gonna hold them down flip

2091
02:42:06,319 --> 02:42:12,720
them over

2092
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:14,800
you can bend them out a little bit but

2093
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:15,840
if i'm working

2094
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:18,880
flat on a table like this

2095
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:21,920
one of the best tricks i've learned for

2096
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:24,399
dealing with

2097
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:26,000
some of these through-hole components

2098
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,359
that you really do want flush to the

2099
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:28,960
board but maybe don't

2100
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:32,000
sit nicely on a table is we do

2101
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,800
the first

2102
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:41,600
leg on each one

2103
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:44,880
and just give them a little solder

2104
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:46,240
and then what we're going to do is we'll

2105
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:48,960
lift up the board

2106
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:50,560
and we're going to check that these are

2107
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:52,310
all the way down and flush

2108
02:42:52,310 --> 02:42:53,680
[Music]

2109
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:56,640
the reason we only did one like instead

2110
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:59,680
of both is because now we can reheat

2111
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:02,720
the one leg we did apply a little

2112
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:05,680
pressure to the top of the led and we'll

2113
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:06,479
get it nice

2114
02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:10,640
and flat against the board

2115
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:13,200
so we'll roll off the side actually

2116
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:13,680
looks

2117
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:16,800
pretty good i'm not going to reflow it

2118
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:20,479
so then we can close out the blues and

2119
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:23,840
do the other side

2120
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:37,840
and we'll nip these again

2121
02:43:41,279 --> 02:43:42,800
their little legs away and the little

2122
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:45,840
tiny crash can

2123
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:48,479
and then in the middle three and four

2124
02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:50,720
are the green ones and same thing we're

2125
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:51,439
gonna

2126
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:52,880
make sure that the short leg and the

2127
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:55,840
flat spot go into the

2128
02:43:55,840 --> 02:44:05,840
match up with the silk screen

2129
02:44:10,319 --> 02:44:15,600
and flip a little bend

2130
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:19,840
another little bend

2131
02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:27,920
and let's go ahead and

2132
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:33,520
and one leg there

2133
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:36,399
one leg there

2134
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:40,319
and then we'll just double check these

2135
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:42,720
as well

2136
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:47,279
there we go and there both look really

2137
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:48,880
good

2138
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:52,560
so we'll go ahead and finish these guys

2139
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:01,840
up

2140
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:12,319
now put those done

2141
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:18,399
clip those right off

2142
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:21,040
and into the teeny tiny trash can all

2143
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:23,279
right

2144
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:25,279
and then last but not least of course we

2145
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:29,840
have our red leds

2146
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:47,680
and generally the red one by the time

2147
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,279
you get to the last ones

2148
02:45:49,279 --> 02:45:52,319
they should be pretty good

2149
02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:55,120
because you're able to balance the board

2150
02:45:55,120 --> 02:45:57,840
a bit better

2151
02:45:58,319 --> 02:46:02,240
but we'll go ahead and do those

2152
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:06,080
and yeah in theory not so much in

2153
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:08,000
practice

2154
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,680
so we'll go ahead and rework this one

2155
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:15,040
there we go spin it around

2156
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:19,040
check the other one okay we're good

2157
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,439
let's

2158
02:46:22,479 --> 02:46:25,840
go ahead and take these

2159
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:32,960
all right

2160
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:40,640
and fancy quick clip

2161
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:46,720
which would work all right

2162
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:50,479
so now

2163
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:54,560
is there anybody who has not gotten

2164
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:55,040
through

2165
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:59,439
all six leds and all six resistors

2166
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:04,720
okay does anybody have any questions

2167
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:20,439
comments or concerns at this time

2168
02:47:20,439 --> 02:47:34,640
yeah okay

2169
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:36,240
all right so i'm going to continue on

2170
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:37,680
then

2171
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:39,840
and next up on our agenda are the

2172
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:42,399
buttons and

2173
02:47:42,399 --> 02:47:46,840
where are my buttons oh

2174
02:47:46,840 --> 02:47:49,840
hi

2175
02:47:51,439 --> 02:47:53,840
okay

2176
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:58,049
[Music]

2177
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:02,160
all right and just one quick second i

2178
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:04,720
apparently misplaced my buttons

2179
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:06,800
which is good which is okay i've got a

2180
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:08,720
whole box of them

2181
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:10,319
not a big deal just didn't have any

2182
02:48:10,319 --> 02:48:11,760
sitting out

2183
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:17,359
so two buttons

2184
02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:20,000
white cap

2185
02:48:20,399 --> 02:48:24,080
black cap okay

2186
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:29,920
so these are our buttons they're 12 by

2187
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:32,640
12 millimeter

2188
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:35,359
nice and clicky um they come with caps

2189
02:48:35,359 --> 02:48:36,479
the caps do just

2190
02:48:36,479 --> 02:48:39,680
press on but we are going to wait until

2191
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,800
we are done building

2192
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:44,880
to add those

2193
02:48:44,880 --> 02:48:48,800
so buttons can be a little tricky

2194
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:50,640
um because they do want to kind of

2195
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,880
pressure fit in place

2196
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:54,000
so what you want to do is you want to

2197
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,160
take one side and just kind of get it

2198
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:59,279
situated in the holes and then come

2199
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:00,160
around to

2200
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:04,080
the other side and do whatever you need

2201
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:04,640
to do

2202
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:07,600
as far as squeezing to get them all the

2203
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:09,120
way down

2204
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:12,240
and then snap back to the first side

2205
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:14,160
i'll show that again because we have two

2206
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:16,560
buttons

2207
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:19,840
and so first we just want to line up the

2208
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:22,479
one side

2209
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:27,760
and flip it over

2210
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:30,720
and kind of squeeze to get the other

2211
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:41,279
side in

2212
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:45,600
and so once you've squeezed

2213
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,399
they're nice and tight they're almost

2214
02:49:48,399 --> 02:49:49,279
usable as

2215
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:52,080
is um because they do kind of pressure

2216
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:53,359
set them

2217
02:49:53,359 --> 02:49:56,080
selves a little bit so let's see if we

2218
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:59,920
can get a good angle to

2219
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:06,160
for the other camera there we go

2220
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:10,800
and then the only thing you really need

2221
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:12,560
to know about the buttons right now

2222
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:14,319
is that they are a little bigger we

2223
02:50:14,319 --> 02:50:16,319
don't need to clip them because the ends

2224
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:17,760
are round

2225
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:19,040
um they are going to take a little

2226
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,040
longer i would give the these guys a

2227
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:21,520
full

2228
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:24,960
one two to heat up before you try to add

2229
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:27,759
any solder

2230
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:31,120
just because the pads are a little

2231
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:35,040
bigger the holes are a little wider

2232
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:37,520
and we're dealing with a little bit more

2233
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:39,920
metal to heat up

2234
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:43,200
before we do our buttons

2235
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:48,479
but at least when we're after we've

2236
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:51,840
soldered

2237
02:50:57,760 --> 02:50:59,279
i don't know stephen would you prefer if

2238
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:04,410
i said momentary tax switch

2239
02:51:04,410 --> 02:51:15,409
[Music]

2240
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,200
so there's our lovely tactile buttons

2241
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:21,760
all soldered up and ready to go the

2242
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,279
clicky things yes

2243
02:51:23,279 --> 02:51:26,000
we're playing with the clicky things the

2244
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,080
clicky things work as clicky things

2245
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:30,160
even if we're not doing anything else

2246
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:32,000
and they make that satisfying

2247
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,120
clicky thing noise

2248
02:51:35,279 --> 02:51:38,479
so we're gonna leave the caps off

2249
02:51:38,479 --> 02:51:40,560
um just because as i found from the

2250
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:42,319
first build because it had been a while

2251
02:51:42,319 --> 02:51:45,040
since i had put one of these together

2252
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:46,880
is that if we leave the caps off until

2253
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:48,160
the very very end

2254
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:50,319
we can balance the backside on the leds

2255
02:51:50,319 --> 02:51:53,760
which will be much more stable

2256
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:00,560
all right so next up we are going to do

2257
02:52:00,560 --> 02:52:02,960
our little oled screens

2258
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:06,479
most of you should have flip back here

2259
02:52:06,479 --> 02:52:07,840
most of you should have gotten these

2260
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:09,600
little black ones

2261
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:12,800
um they did run short and some of them

2262
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:13,840
were

2263
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:16,880
this blue color um there's really no

2264
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:18,640
difference in the boards

2265
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:21,040
other than the fact that one of their

2266
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,479
engineers got created

2267
02:52:22,479 --> 02:52:25,600
and was able to save themselves a couple

2268
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,399
millimeters of pcb

2269
02:52:28,399 --> 02:52:31,439
that's pretty much it as far as

2270
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:33,920
as far as components and how they

2271
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:34,560
function

2272
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:37,040
they are identical i'm going to use the

2273
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:39,520
blue one

2274
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:44,880
just because i like the blue one

2275
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:48,240
so these go there's really only one way

2276
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:50,720
you can put these in

2277
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:53,760
pins at the top make sure it's outlined

2278
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:56,560
with the silk screen then you've got the

2279
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:57,680
four

2280
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:00,080
pins that we'll solder in a second here

2281
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:03,120
these do not really lay flat

2282
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:08,560
um mostly trying to keep our costs down

2283
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:12,960
so i didn't drill for um

2284
02:53:12,960 --> 02:53:14,720
any standoffs to make sure they were

2285
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:16,479
flat they'll sit at a little bit of an

2286
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:19,680
angle that's fine fine they're actually

2287
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:21,200
a little easier to read at a little bit

2288
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:23,439
of an angle

2289
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:26,479
so let's go ahead and solder those and

2290
02:53:26,479 --> 02:53:28,960
as you can see what just happened

2291
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,439
the pins dropped through maybe or maybe

2292
02:53:31,439 --> 02:53:33,680
not

2293
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:38,479
see down here so the pins kind of

2294
02:53:38,479 --> 02:53:39,520
dropped through

2295
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:42,479
and that's okay mostly what we want to

2296
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:46,880
do is we want to get solder in one joint

2297
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:53,279
just like that

2298
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:55,439
and then much like when we reflowed the

2299
02:53:55,439 --> 02:53:56,880
leds

2300
02:53:56,880 --> 02:53:59,120
we're going to go ahead and reflow that

2301
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:01,520
so that this plastic here

2302
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:04,800
is flat against the board and then we

2303
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:07,600
can do the other three

2304
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:11,680
so there now it's flat against the board

2305
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:15,680
and we'll go ahead and do the other

2306
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:21,840
three

2307
02:54:24,930 --> 02:54:31,920
[Music]

2308
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:37,200
all right there we go

2309
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:42,479
and there's two

2310
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:46,080
and there's three

2311
02:54:46,560 --> 02:54:48,160
and those look pretty good

2312
02:54:48,160 --> 02:54:51,359
[Music]

2313
02:54:51,359 --> 02:54:53,439
just touch them up just a little bit

2314
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:55,680
here

2315
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,240
here make sure all that solder is down

2316
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:03,760
in the hole

2317
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:07,120
and then these little guys we are going

2318
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:08,560
to go ahead and clip them

2319
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:12,160
i like to clip them all at once

2320
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:15,520
and i do put my hand over it because

2321
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:16,080
otherwise

2322
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:19,120
they will go flying

2323
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:31,840
oh come on really guys wow

2324
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:40,479
all right not today apparently

2325
02:55:40,479 --> 02:55:43,940
so it's one two how

2326
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:47,040
[Music]

2327
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:50,880
and before okay

2328
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:54,080
so we got those that's done so that

2329
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:55,520
takes care of the front side of our

2330
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:57,200
board

2331
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:58,800
you will notice that there are some

2332
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,479
holes

2333
02:56:00,479 --> 02:56:05,679
or some pads that we didn't use um

2334
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:07,680
so you can get a little bit bigger

2335
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:10,840
better let's see if we can get one in a

2336
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:13,760
there oh so you are going to notice that

2337
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:15,040
there are some holes

2338
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:19,680
on the board they'll be labeled gp7 gp8

2339
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:23,040
gp6 seven and eight and then a ground

2340
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:27,520
uh those are four if you want to add

2341
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:31,680
an extra something later on

2342
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:37,120
a buzzer another some neopixels

2343
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:39,439
whatever you can get away with with

2344
02:56:39,439 --> 02:56:41,040
three pins

2345
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:44,960
and a ground you can go for it

2346
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:48,080
you could just throw a couple of

2347
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:50,560
leads on there to say pull it over to a

2348
02:56:50,560 --> 02:56:52,800
breadboard

2349
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:57,600
but i did want to give you the option to

2350
02:56:57,600 --> 02:57:00,800
to expand on these guys a little bit

2351
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:04,640
so now we are up to the backside

2352
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:07,120
now before i go on is there anybody who

2353
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,040
is not done with the front of their

2354
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,359
board

2355
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:14,399
all right let's go ahead and do a ready

2356
02:57:14,399 --> 02:57:15,760
check

2357
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:23,600
let's see those k's emojis smiley faces

2358
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:25,359
pictures of your pets no i'm kidding i

2359
02:57:25,359 --> 02:57:28,479
don't think they allow that but

2360
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:32,640
okay we'll give sherry a minute that's

2361
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:34,640
not a problem i can

2362
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:38,800
take a swig off this bottle of pop and

2363
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:51,840
go from there

2364
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:19,840
all right

2365
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:52,800
okay so now we're going to flip the

2366
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:53,920
board over

2367
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:57,120
and we're going to work from the back or

2368
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:58,479
we're going to be placing stuff on the

2369
02:58:58,479 --> 02:59:00,160
back we'll be soldering on the front

2370
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:02,000
whereas before we were placing stuff on

2371
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
the front and soldering in the back

2372
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:07,279
so included in your kit was two sets of

2373
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:09,600
pin headers

2374
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:12,960
these guys here with the

2375
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:17,520
single row of pins and then a row

2376
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:21,680
of holes they're the female pin headers

2377
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:23,760
and then of course these that are pins

2378
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:25,439
on both directions

2379
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:28,880
are considered the male headers

2380
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:32,080
you do have the option to just

2381
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:35,439
use the mail headers you would stick

2382
02:59:35,439 --> 02:59:37,840
them on

2383
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:39,840
if you just stick on the mail headers on

2384
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:43,840
like this

2385
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:52,399
this you're more than welcome to do that

2386
02:59:52,399 --> 02:59:54,399
however when we get to the final

2387
02:59:54,399 --> 02:59:57,840
step your pot your your pie pico will be

2388
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:00,319
permanently attached to this board

2389
03:00:00,319 --> 03:00:03,279
unless you want to do a lot of really

2390
03:00:03,279 --> 03:00:05,520
nasty de-soldering

2391
03:00:05,520 --> 03:00:09,439
so we want to make our picos portable

2392
03:00:09,439 --> 03:00:11,200
portable we want you to be able to play

2393
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:12,800
with them or

2394
03:00:12,800 --> 03:00:16,080
if you have another idea for a project

2395
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:19,279
you can um although you probably don't

2396
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:22,080
need to these are

2397
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:26,800
four bucks four bucks for genuine parts

2398
03:00:26,800 --> 03:00:28,720
we like that so we're gonna start by

2399
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:30,160
putting the

2400
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:33,200
female pit headers um pins

2401
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:37,200
pins to the board um

2402
03:00:37,279 --> 03:00:40,240
pins to the board holes sticking out and

2403
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:43,040
we're just going to do one for now

2404
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:46,960
and right or left it doesn't matter

2405
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:49,600
and what we want to do is we're going to

2406
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:53,439
flip the board over

2407
03:00:53,439 --> 03:00:56,880
very carefully and gently

2408
03:00:57,359 --> 03:01:00,960
and then much like we did for the leds

2409
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:07,040
and the screens we're only going to

2410
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:09,760
do one

2411
03:01:12,240 --> 03:01:16,240
pin because after we do the one pin

2412
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:19,279
we're going to check

2413
03:01:19,359 --> 03:01:24,080
from every angle and

2414
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:32,960
huh sorry about that buddy um these are

2415
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,000
going to be posted to

2416
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:37,040
youtube um it might take an extra day or

2417
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:39,200
two for mine because i know that

2418
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:41,520
nicole likes to look at both and kind of

2419
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:42,960
cut together the

2420
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:46,479
better sections um mostly because

2421
03:01:46,479 --> 03:01:50,479
you know speech impediment but whatever

2422
03:01:50,479 --> 03:01:53,359
anyway so yeah um if you don't get to it

2423
03:01:53,359 --> 03:01:54,560
um that's fine

2424
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:56,479
um do come to the sessions tomorrow

2425
03:01:56,479 --> 03:02:00,080
where we'll talk about programming it

2426
03:02:00,960 --> 03:02:04,560
if you can hear me um

2427
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:07,439
and we can and there are dot and there

2428
03:02:07,439 --> 03:02:09,120
is documentation

2429
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:13,399
available on my blog at tech

2430
03:02:13,399 --> 03:02:15,760
techgirlmnn.com

2431
03:02:15,760 --> 03:02:19,279
links should be in the chat

2432
03:02:22,080 --> 03:02:25,520
you might have to scroll back thank you

2433
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:27,200
sakura

2434
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:31,279
you're awesome

2435
03:02:31,279 --> 03:02:33,520
yes

2436
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:38,479
all right so we're gonna go ahead and

2437
03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:40,399
we're gonna finish up

2438
03:02:40,399 --> 03:02:42,960
this row of pin headers so as you can

2439
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:44,160
see

2440
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:46,240
um yeah i was a little off they're a

2441
03:02:46,240 --> 03:02:48,880
little wobbly

2442
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:52,479
and just like before we're gonna hold

2443
03:02:52,479 --> 03:02:55,438
the thing down

2444
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:59,200
and reflow and

2445
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:02,240
basically until you hear a click

2446
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:05,439
and now we're going to check it again

2447
03:03:05,439 --> 03:03:08,399
and as you can see we're square there

2448
03:03:08,399 --> 03:03:12,479
we're square there

2449
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:16,960
and we're square there

2450
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:19,040
so then we're going to start at the

2451
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:22,160
opposite end

2452
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,319
and we're just going to start doing

2453
03:03:26,319 --> 03:03:29,359
these one by one and i'll go ahead and

2454
03:03:29,359 --> 03:03:33,279
just throw you into the other view here

2455
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:38,840
for a minute so you can kind of see that

2456
03:03:38,840 --> 03:03:41,840
happening

2457
03:03:41,840 --> 03:03:44,160
and

2458
03:03:45,439 --> 03:03:55,840
we'll do the light magnification here

2459
03:04:03,359 --> 03:04:09,840
there and there

2460
03:04:20,240 --> 03:04:22,000
and we'll just keep going with the pin

2461
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,399
headers

2462
03:04:26,800 --> 03:04:28,960
and i did purposely put a lot of pin

2463
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:30,319
headers on here

2464
03:04:30,319 --> 03:04:31,840
just to make sure that you all got

2465
03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:34,160
plenty of practice

2466
03:04:34,160 --> 03:04:37,840
with your through-hole soldering

2467
03:04:44,399 --> 03:04:46,240
so when all said and done you're going

2468
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:47,520
to have eight you

2469
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:51,840
have done 80 of these pinhole joints

2470
03:04:56,800 --> 03:04:58,720
i can't say that you did not have

2471
03:04:58,720 --> 03:05:01,359
adequate time

2472
03:05:01,359 --> 03:05:05,840
to practice soldering

2473
03:05:08,980 --> 03:05:10,800
[Music]

2474
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:19,840
and we'll just keep going

2475
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:24,960
until it doesn't want to play anymore

2476
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:26,000
and we'll clean the tip

2477
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:33,840
and start over

2478
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:47,840
and then one by one

2479
03:06:06,610 --> 03:06:08,160
[Music]

2480
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:12,000
just kept reworking these back and forth

2481
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,960
you want to make sure that the hole is a

2482
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:15,840
hundred percent

2483
03:06:15,840 --> 03:06:17,920
filled and we've got just a little bit

2484
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:20,640
sticking out

2485
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:25,439
if you ever seen a bag of hershey's

2486
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:27,520
kisses you'll know exactly what the

2487
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:30,640
shape i'm going for here

2488
03:06:34,080 --> 03:06:38,240
so with one side done we can take a look

2489
03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:43,840
here

2490
03:06:44,319 --> 03:06:46,479
sorry about this sometimes it is really

2491
03:06:46,479 --> 03:06:49,920
really hard to do things backwards

2492
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:57,840
there we go

2493
03:06:57,920 --> 03:07:00,960
and don't worry cameras are weird

2494
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:04,240
all right so there it is there's one

2495
03:07:04,240 --> 03:07:05,920
side done

2496
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:08,840
with 20 almost perfect little hershey's

2497
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:10,080
kisses

2498
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:12,000
going so now we can go on to the other

2499
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,520
side

2500
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:15,040
and we're going to do it the exact same

2501
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:16,640
way

2502
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:24,399
we're going to put in

2503
03:07:24,399 --> 03:07:26,399
our row of pin headers we're going to

2504
03:07:26,399 --> 03:07:29,119
flip it over

2505
03:07:32,319 --> 03:07:36,479
we're going to go ahead and do just the

2506
03:07:36,840 --> 03:07:39,359
one

2507
03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:42,319
here at the bottom

2508
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:46,960
and we're going to sight in and make

2509
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:48,760
sure that it is

2510
03:07:48,760 --> 03:07:52,760
square this way

2511
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:56,560
square that way

2512
03:07:58,240 --> 03:08:00,479
and we're just going to double reflow it

2513
03:08:00,479 --> 03:08:03,040
just to be sure

2514
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:06,160
while holding it

2515
03:08:06,160 --> 03:08:09,760
down and now we can go ahead and take

2516
03:08:09,760 --> 03:08:20,640
care of the other side

2517
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:23,760
and one more one

2518
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:25,600
i'm just gonna fill each one of these

2519
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:34,160
little header holes up

2520
03:08:34,160 --> 03:08:37,840
with solder now you may notice

2521
03:08:37,840 --> 03:08:40,720
um especially here on the front where

2522
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:41,840
we're doing

2523
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:44,960
where we're doing these pin headers is

2524
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:47,520
that you'll have like a residue that'll

2525
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:48,800
look

2526
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:52,160
either like wet or greasy um what that

2527
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:52,479
is

2528
03:08:52,479 --> 03:08:56,399
is that there is rosin flux

2529
03:08:56,399 --> 03:09:00,479
in the middle of your solder

2530
03:09:00,479 --> 03:09:02,640
and some of it has just spilled out it

2531
03:09:02,640 --> 03:09:05,200
didn't all burn off

2532
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:08,319
and that is entirely okay

2533
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:11,920
it is best if you get rid of it at some

2534
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:14,319
point

2535
03:09:14,479 --> 03:09:17,200
my personal recommendation is going to

2536
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:17,600
be

2537
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:21,120
rubbering alcohol and either a paper

2538
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:22,399
towel or a coffee

2539
03:09:22,399 --> 03:09:25,279
filter um you want something that's not

2540
03:09:25,279 --> 03:09:26,080
going to leave

2541
03:09:26,080 --> 03:09:30,080
fibers behind such as a cotton swab or

2542
03:09:30,080 --> 03:09:34,000
a cotton ball so yeah paper towel shop

2543
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:35,520
towel

2544
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:36,880
coffee filters are good you want

2545
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:38,640
something that's going to rip but not

2546
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:42,319
leave behind traces

2547
03:09:42,319 --> 03:09:45,520
old toothbrush works well too so there

2548
03:09:45,520 --> 03:09:50,080
are our female headers

2549
03:09:50,080 --> 03:09:53,520
all on and all ready to go

2550
03:09:54,880 --> 03:09:56,840
and now we're going to talk about the

2551
03:09:56,840 --> 03:09:59,840
pico

2552
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:05,600
let me go out of the little bag okay

2553
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:09,840
so this is our raspberry pi pico um

2554
03:10:09,840 --> 03:10:12,880
they are micro controllers not not

2555
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:14,560
lightweight linux systems

2556
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:18,319
unlike the other versions of pi's

2557
03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:21,920
pi's out there they did actually design

2558
03:10:21,920 --> 03:10:23,439
their own

2559
03:10:23,439 --> 03:10:26,479
chip for these guys um and they are

2560
03:10:26,479 --> 03:10:28,239
coming in

2561
03:10:28,239 --> 03:10:31,760
um retail for four dollars

2562
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:34,880
if you go to amazon or ebay and you see

2563
03:10:34,880 --> 03:10:37,040
them for six seven eight dollars

2564
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:40,239
uh take your time wait go to

2565
03:10:40,239 --> 03:10:43,680
a go to a repute reputable dealer

2566
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:47,439
digikey mouser adafruit uh pie hut et

2567
03:10:47,439 --> 03:10:48,720
cetera et cetera

2568
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:50,479
and make sure that you're not paying

2569
03:10:50,479 --> 03:10:52,319
four dollars more than four dollars for

2570
03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:53,520
these guys because that's all they

2571
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:55,520
should be

2572
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:59,760
they do have the fun

2573
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:00,800
i'm not even going to say the word

2574
03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:03,359
castle castellated

2575
03:11:03,359 --> 03:11:07,200
english hard holes what that means is

2576
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:08,319
that i could have

2577
03:11:08,319 --> 03:11:11,680
opted to put little pads on the back of

2578
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:12,560
the board and just

2579
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:14,880
surfaced and just done this as a surface

2580
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:16,479
mount unit

2581
03:11:16,479 --> 03:11:19,840
um pin um through holes a little easier

2582
03:11:19,840 --> 03:11:21,920
for beginners so that's why we did the

2583
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:24,640
way we did it

2584
03:11:25,279 --> 03:11:28,479
so it also can make these guys a little

2585
03:11:28,479 --> 03:11:30,160
challenging

2586
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:33,600
to solder but that's okay

2587
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:37,840
so normally when we do

2588
03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:40,720
pin headers you put the little the

2589
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:42,960
little end in here

2590
03:11:42,960 --> 03:11:46,560
and then um best practice says put this

2591
03:11:46,560 --> 03:11:48,239
in a breadboard

2592
03:11:48,239 --> 03:11:50,160
since i know not everybody's going to

2593
03:11:50,160 --> 03:11:52,560
have an extra breadboard lying around

2594
03:11:52,560 --> 03:11:54,239
especially one that they might

2595
03:11:54,239 --> 03:11:58,000
that might get hot and damaged um

2596
03:11:58,000 --> 03:11:59,359
that's the other reason we did the

2597
03:11:59,359 --> 03:12:00,400
female headers

2598
03:12:00,400 --> 03:12:01,760
[Music]

2599
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:04,960
so if we take the male headers

2600
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:07,279
and we're going to actually hold them in

2601
03:12:07,279 --> 03:12:08,560
place

2602
03:12:08,560 --> 03:12:10,399
or use the female headers to hold the

2603
03:12:10,399 --> 03:12:11,840
male headers

2604
03:12:11,840 --> 03:12:15,040
in place just like that

2605
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:17,520
you want to make sure that they are safe

2606
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:18,640
secure

2607
03:12:18,640 --> 03:12:21,760
and that you've used the long end

2608
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:25,120
into the uh

2609
03:12:25,120 --> 03:12:27,840
female edge i'll just hold a bit of a

2610
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:29,120
header out

2611
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:30,560
so you can see kind of what it would

2612
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:33,840
look like inside

2613
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:41,359
yep and now

2614
03:12:41,359 --> 03:12:44,319
if our female headers are correct and

2615
03:12:44,319 --> 03:12:44,960
our male

2616
03:12:44,960 --> 03:12:48,880
headers with a little wiggling this guy

2617
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:50,800
should pop right on

2618
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:52,800
but make sure that we are popped on

2619
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:56,319
according to the silk screen

2620
03:12:56,319 --> 03:13:00,640
the usb port the mini usb port

2621
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:02,880
should be pointed out and these three

2622
03:13:02,880 --> 03:13:05,358
extra

2623
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:09,520
pins that we that i didn't set up

2624
03:13:09,520 --> 03:13:12,800
should be up towards the top

2625
03:13:12,800 --> 03:13:15,840
and there we go

2626
03:13:17,750 --> 03:13:20,819
[Music]

2627
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:24,720
yeah i couldn't even afford to do it

2628
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:28,319
back then

2629
03:13:28,319 --> 03:13:30,000
i remember paying 30 bucks for an

2630
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:31,439
arduino and i thought it was the best

2631
03:13:31,439 --> 03:13:32,720
day ever

2632
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:36,160
and now we're for boxing

2633
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:39,359
okay yeah

2634
03:13:39,359 --> 03:13:43,840
i know

2635
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:46,560
all right so let's go ahead and get

2636
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:48,640
these header pins so that we can

2637
03:13:48,640 --> 03:13:50,960
actually get out on time

2638
03:13:50,960 --> 03:13:54,479
because yes okay

2639
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:57,359
and don't mind me i'm just playing with

2640
03:13:57,359 --> 03:14:01,040
camera or for the camera

2641
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:02,720
it's really hard because hoppin puts in

2642
03:14:02,720 --> 03:14:06,560
everything backwards

2643
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:13,120
oh hi jenny how are you

2644
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:16,479
so does anybody have any other questions

2645
03:14:16,479 --> 03:14:25,840
before we get this final step again

2646
03:14:34,319 --> 03:14:36,319
okay hearing no questions we'll move on

2647
03:14:36,319 --> 03:14:39,600
to the last bit of soldering

2648
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:43,040
which is the pins for the pico

2649
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,600
they are gold plated which is good on

2650
03:14:45,600 --> 03:14:47,840
them

2651
03:14:49,359 --> 03:14:51,439
but they do present an interesting

2652
03:14:51,439 --> 03:14:52,720
challenge because

2653
03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:55,439
there are little tiny things little

2654
03:14:55,439 --> 03:14:56,399
teeny tiny

2655
03:14:56,399 --> 03:14:58,399
things in the middle here which makes

2656
03:14:58,399 --> 03:14:59,600
heat

2657
03:14:59,600 --> 03:15:06,640
tricky so what i have found

2658
03:15:06,640 --> 03:15:08,800
is that we always want to have the the

2659
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:10,239
iron to the outside

2660
03:15:10,239 --> 03:15:13,040
when we do these these and if you need

2661
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:14,319
to twist and

2662
03:15:14,319 --> 03:15:16,399
and turn your board to get it done you

2663
03:15:16,399 --> 03:15:18,080
twist and turn to the board to get it

2664
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:19,359
done

2665
03:15:19,359 --> 03:15:22,560
so let's just go ahead

2666
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:25,358
we'll do one

2667
03:15:26,160 --> 03:15:29,120
should be good we'll give it a quick

2668
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:31,200
peek

2669
03:15:31,200 --> 03:15:34,960
yeah we're still good

2670
03:15:34,960 --> 03:15:36,479
i'll maybe find a camera angle that

2671
03:15:36,479 --> 03:15:38,880
works

2672
03:15:39,279 --> 03:15:41,840
there we go do some of these under

2673
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:49,840
magnification for you

2674
03:16:00,800 --> 03:16:06,479
yeah we'll keep going one by one

2675
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:17,110
clean the iron

2676
03:16:17,110 --> 03:16:20,519

03:16:36,319 --> 03:16:39,040
and also when it comes to you when it

2678
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:39,840
comes to

2679
03:16:39,840 --> 03:16:42,000
these final sets of pins it's not just

2680
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:43,840
you they are a little more difficult

2681
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:47,279
than the ones we have been working on

2682
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:52,800
so just take your time and be patient

2683
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:55,519
if you have

2684
03:16:56,399 --> 03:16:59,120
if you have soldered before or doing

2685
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:01,200
this with a parent who maybe has a lot

2686
03:17:01,200 --> 03:17:03,439
of soldering equipment

2687
03:17:03,439 --> 03:17:07,520
ask them for some flux it'll definitely

2688
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:13,380
help

2689
03:17:13,380 --> 03:17:16,570
[Music]

2690
03:17:19,359 --> 03:17:21,680
so we'll just spin this around and do

2691
03:17:21,680 --> 03:17:22,960
the

2692
03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:24,880
opposite corner since we're lined up

2693
03:17:24,880 --> 03:17:27,839
pretty good here

2694
03:17:29,810 --> 03:17:33,529
[Music]

2695
03:17:36,319 --> 03:17:39,840
and that will be it once you have all of

2696
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:40,239
these

2697
03:17:40,239 --> 03:17:43,600
done you are done for the day

2698
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:46,800
um in the in the sessions tomorrow we'll

2699
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:48,479
go over

2700
03:17:48,479 --> 03:17:52,319
how to get it to talk to your computer

2701
03:17:52,319 --> 03:17:55,520
you don't need any you don't need a

2702
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:59,680
special or specific ide to program these

2703
03:17:59,680 --> 03:18:01,279
unlike

2704
03:18:01,279 --> 03:18:04,720
um unlike say an arduino

2705
03:18:04,720 --> 03:18:09,359
or or something else um

2706
03:18:09,359 --> 03:18:13,600
else um they are um i at least

2707
03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:15,040
you can use two different forms of

2708
03:18:15,040 --> 03:18:17,040
python in them circuit python and or

2709
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:18,479
micro python

2710
03:18:18,479 --> 03:18:20,239
we're going to be using circuit python

2711
03:18:20,239 --> 03:18:21,520
just because i like

2712
03:18:21,520 --> 03:18:24,479
just cause um adafruit does a really

2713
03:18:24,479 --> 03:18:26,000
really good job of documenting their

2714
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:27,040
things

2715
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:30,120
um so you don't really need anything

2716
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:32,720
special to program you can program with

2717
03:18:32,720 --> 03:18:34,640
these guys with notepad

2718
03:18:34,640 --> 03:18:35,920
and then they will appear on your

2719
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:38,000
computer as a little tiny usb

2720
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:43,600
drive which is really really handy

2721
03:18:45,600 --> 03:18:49,200
so i'm going to let that go there

2722
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:51,279
and find out that i wasn't doing the

2723
03:18:51,279 --> 03:18:53,359
right end

2724
03:18:53,359 --> 03:18:57,200
because cameras are weird

2725
03:18:59,279 --> 03:19:02,560
and we'll try this again

2726
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:06,319
with those

2727
03:19:14,239 --> 03:19:18,720
um i am going to link

2728
03:19:18,720 --> 03:19:22,479
here in a second a quick two section

2729
03:19:22,479 --> 03:19:25,600
second a question

2730
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:28,239
okay i can't talk anymore tonight a two

2731
03:19:28,239 --> 03:19:29,680
question survey

2732
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:33,359
regarding what kind of activities beyond

2733
03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:35,760
a soldering blinky diy badge you would

2734
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:37,120
all like to see

2735
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:40,319
next year assuming we are in person

2736
03:19:40,319 --> 03:19:46,720
and even if we're not in person um

2737
03:19:46,720 --> 03:19:49,439
i have a wide range of craft skills and

2738
03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:51,359
i'm more than happy to

2739
03:19:51,359 --> 03:19:53,439
branch out with our maker village

2740
03:19:53,439 --> 03:19:54,880
options

2741
03:19:54,880 --> 03:19:57,600
so if y'all could hit me up and take the

2742
03:19:57,600 --> 03:19:58,960
survey

2743
03:19:58,960 --> 03:20:02,319
i deeply appreciate it it helps me plan

2744
03:20:02,319 --> 03:20:04,399
it helps me budget

2745
03:20:04,399 --> 03:20:06,399
it helps me decide which things need to

2746
03:20:06,399 --> 03:20:08,720
have a sponsor sticker

2747
03:20:08,720 --> 03:20:15,840
slapped on them so we can afford them

2748
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:23,279
so please do take the survey

2749
03:20:23,279 --> 03:20:25,120
and i really gotta change up that hotkey

2750
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:28,160
all right

2751
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:30,640
so mine's not 100 done i'll finish it

2752
03:20:30,640 --> 03:20:31,600
later

2753
03:20:31,600 --> 03:20:33,120
but that's where we're going to leave it

2754
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:35,040
off tonight

2755
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:38,399
go ahead and add your buttons

2756
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:42,319
and these are just bits of plastic it

2757
03:20:42,319 --> 03:20:43,279
doesn't matter

2758
03:20:43,279 --> 03:20:46,080
if you want right on the right and and

2759
03:20:46,080 --> 03:20:47,359

um

2767
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:26,880

2782
03:22:04,880 --> 03:22:06,080
some parts

2783
03:22:06,080 --> 03:22:08,000

2784
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:09,359
i could show you the different ways to

2785
03:22:09,359 --> 03:22:12,160
