00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
different things there's certainly a lot

15

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,600
um

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,079
and but yeah thank you very much for for

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
taking some time off to to come and

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,239
you know spend time with us and uh with

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,239
this talk uh specifically um

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,319
thank you very much now before we begin

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,600
let me just uh thank our sponsors uh

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,840
uh starting with uh elon

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,640
security and ex exoneus so exoneus they

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,159
do asset tracking which is very

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
important because uh you can't secure

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,799
something if you don't know it exists so

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,960
um they'll help you out with that uh

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
managing your assets

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,880
and then you learn security which is now

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439
running on ine's platform uh they have a

32
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,960
free tier so you can actually get

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
started with them for free

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
uh see if you enjoy what what that what

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
they offer um if you don't you don't and

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
if you do then yeah you're welcome to to

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
continue with them um so

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
this conference would not be as

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
professional or as big or as nice

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
without without uh you know the support

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,159
of all the sponsors

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,960
and

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,680
you

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,320
yeah very much recommend to recommend it

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,759
to check them all out and see what

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
um

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
and

49

so they also have virtual booths so you

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,840
booths

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
and see what they're about but i'll go

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,920
do that right now because now we have an

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
amazing talk um

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,400
by cathy ellis who is a cyber lawyer

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
in the san francisco bay area

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,440
and a contributor to tech dirt

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,920
uh kathy works a lot with online speech

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
and platforms and the talk today is

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,239
section 230

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,080
the law that everyone loves to hate and

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
what it means to you i'm

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
really excited to see this because i've

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
heard a lot about section 230 recently

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
um and so uh yeah and i i love the law

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,879
it always impacts on on information

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,360
security in the most interesting ways

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,920
um so yeah without

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
any more adieu

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
uh kathy take it away

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,239
great thanks alan and thanks to the

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
diana initiative for having me um

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
i am here to talk to you about one of

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
the hottest topics these days section

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,920
230 and as ellen said i'm a lawyer and

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
one of the things i do in my practice as

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,560
a lawyer is defend section two three and

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
i do this because what i'm really trying

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,239
to do is defend speech

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
and to have speech online means that we

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
have to defend the platforms that

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,680
facilitate it and as i'll explain in the

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
talk that means we have to have section

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
230.

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
um i've given a variation of this talk a

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,519
few times before and in one of them i

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
use the idea of online cat pictures as a

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
type of online speech we can easily get

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
our head around it because where do we

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
get all our cat pictures on the internet

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,879
the internet obviously being made of

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,840
cats

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
it's all the people who use the internet

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
who

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
provide all this content and make the

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
internet this rich place that it is um

98
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,720
this is what we call user generated

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,879
content and this is what section 230

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,120
exists to facilitate because if we

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
didn't have section 230 to

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
enable the platforms who exist we

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,439
wouldn't be able to get the

104
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
user-generated content and the internet

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
and supply of cat pictures would all be

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
corporate and we'd have nothing but

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
disney cats and that would be sad

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,319
so i am going to explain what secularity

109
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
does why it's good why we shouldn't mess

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
with it and try to frame the big picture

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
so

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
before i go into it and i'm gonna give

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
you a scenic tour of the statute but

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
don't be afraid it's a readable statute

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
and i'm here to help translate it'll be

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
fine

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
um i want to point out some overarching

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
principles to think about in the back of

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,440
your mind that when i tell the statutory

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,560
story

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
this is why the language in it is

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
important and this is the job that it's

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
doing so one big thing like overarching

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
principles

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
when you hear people complain about

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
section 230

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
they're not really complaining about

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
section 230 they're complaining about

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,759
the internet um because let's face it

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
there's some crap on the internet some

131
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
bad things happen on the internet

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,479
there's some bad people on the internet

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,080
and some of them say and do bad things

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
and that problem and we

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
legitimately can get upset by that

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,039
but it also may be not section 230

137
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,120
that's creating the environment where

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,039
that stuff can end some of it is the

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
first amendment because we protect free

140
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
speech very broadly in the united states

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
because it's only by protecting italy

142
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,960
that we protect it for the good speech

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
but it means we also have you know if

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
people can speak

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
if we try to keep it that nobody could

146
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
ever say and say or do anything bad um

147
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
we would also accidentally take out

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
people's ability to say or do anything

149
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
good and that would be a problem so some

150
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
of what we actually have here is not

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
even section 230 operating on the

152
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,919
internet itself it's that the things

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
that people are complaining about the

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,199
first amendment would have protected

155
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
somebody in this picture entirely so

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
even if you got rid of section 230 you

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
wouldn't change the thing that you're

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
upset about

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
okay

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
but the reason why section 230 is

161
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,520
important is because litigation can be

162
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
cripplingly

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,479
even when you might win

164
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,800
it can be devastating to have to go

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
through the process of defending your

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,600
position

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,560
so even to the extent that a platform

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,520
may have its own first amendment rights

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
for instance in choosing what content to

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
facilitate and have on its systems

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
that's all well and good that it has the

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
first amendment right to do it but it

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,639
also needs some protection so it doesn't

174
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,560
get obliterated by lawsuits along the

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
way in order to exercise his first

176
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
amendment right

177
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
the point of section 230 is to make sure

178
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,840
that the

179
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
systems that we depend on in order to

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,000
have the internet can exist without

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
being obliterated from potential

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
liability for how users use their system

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
because if we think about the amount of

184
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
content that's actually going up think

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,800
about how many tweets are happening per

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
hour day minute

187
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
how could somebody who's offering a

188
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,080
service like that possibly

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
keep track and police everything that's

190
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,120
ending up on their systems it wouldn't

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,039
be possible and

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,319
if they were in a position where they

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
might get legally

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
eventually obliterated if they let

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
something

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,479
troubling through

197
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
who could be in the business of of

198
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
offering these services the reality is

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,919
that the internet

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
works by essentially being a system of

201
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
helpers for people to be able to speak

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,479
online they need systems that can help

203
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,960
them speak online and section 230 is all

204
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
about protecting those helpers and

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
making it legally and financially

206
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
practical for them to exist so they

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,400
don't have to worry about getting in

208
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,520
trouble for the help that they offer

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
put another way the overall goal is

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
section 230 is to ensure that we get the

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
most good stuff line as well as the

212
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,120
least bad it puts the helpers the

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
platforms the service providers in a

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
position where

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
they can do the best we can they can to

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,360
help us get the most good stuff

217
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
and the least bad because they're not

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
gonna get in trouble and obliterate it

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,280
if they do it wrong so it gives them the

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,879
incentive to try to get it right

221
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,560
something to think about also is

222
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,639
effective regulation doesn't need to be

223
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,800
punitive we tend to think about law as a

224
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
thou shalt not do x and you you're

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
punished and bad and sent to your room

226
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
uh without desert if you do the bad

227
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,560
thing

228
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
but sometimes there's other ways of

229
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
doing it um carrots work

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,120
what i just said in that with that

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
earlier slide what

232
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
would congress wants the most good stuff

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
and the least bad stuff online what

234
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,760
would align the interests of the

235
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
platform so that they can be partners

236
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
with congress to help make sure we get

237
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,159
that and so section 230 essentially is a

238
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,560
system of carrots rather than sticks

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,080
because instead of saying you're in

240
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
trouble if you get it wrong

241
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
it says

242
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
you're safe if you get it wrong so it

243
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,560
means that the platforms can do the best

244
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
they can to try to get it right

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
the other thing is we're never going to

246
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,519
get this completely right i mean even if

247
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,200
0.0001 of the internet is crap and the

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
rest of it's good the problem is 0.001

249
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
of the internet is an awful lot of

250
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
speech and some very conspicuous

251
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
examples of really terrible stuff and

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that's hard to look at and shrug your

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
shoulders and pretend we're okay with

254
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
but we don't want to lose the 99.99999

255
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,279
of the good stuff

256
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
so what we need is a system that gets as

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
close to

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,600
that optimum balance as we can um the

259
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
most good stuff

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
we can possibly can and the least that

261
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
stuff that we can possibly get section

262
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
230 gives us a chance to get as close to

263
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,320
that goal as possible

264
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,760
so let's talk a little bit about the

265
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
history of where we got section 230. um

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,800
i have thrown into the slide um the

267
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,680
first amendment um it is speaking to a

268
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
lot of what is going on with a lot of

269
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,839
these online policies um and that's

270
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,000
obviously goes back quite a few years um

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to came along with the constitution as

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
part of its original ratification

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
then move ahead 200 years or so and we

274
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
come to the mid 90s when the internet

275
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
stopped being

276
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
just defense and academic thing and

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,560
started to reach the public

278
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
consciousness

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,800
and

280
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
that also created the alarm that people

281
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
were using it for porn

282
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,120
um there was a lot of moral panic about

283
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
all the porn that may be online and

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
let's face it early doctors of

285
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
communications technologies often are

286
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
some of the more adult types of

287
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
communication

288
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
so senator exxon and some of his other

289
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
colleagues were really really worried

290
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,200
about that and they were thinking about

291
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
passing a law to ban the porn online

292
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
meanwhile there was also a lawsuit about

293
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
an existing service provider at the time

294
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,160
called prodigy um i can't see a show of

295
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
hands for how many of you remember

296
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,720
prodigy

297
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
but it was

298
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
originally sort of a dialogue bullet

299
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
board service where

300
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,440
they were online communities it was not

301
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,959
necessarily the internet although

302
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
eventually it got connected up to the

303
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
internet but it was prodigy america

304
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
online compuserve um this was sort of

305
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
our early understanding of a

306
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
commercially available internet

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
and they got sued for content that

308
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
somebody had posted on their systems

309
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,959
and there were a couple of congressmen

310
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
who were not

311
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
happy with well it wasn't just that they

312
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
got sued but there was a state court

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
judge in new york who basically said

314
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
hold you liable for something your users

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
said yeah that sounds good let's let

316
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
this lawsuit go ahead and they were

317
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,399
really alarmed with it be apparently for

318
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,680
two reasons

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,959
if the platform could get in trouble for

320
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,480
the stupid things that its users may

321
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
have been saying

322
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
going back to like that twitter example

323
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
how could they possibly allow all the

324
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
speech we wanted to facilitate online if

325
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
they could end up in trouble for it this

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,519
is not good

327
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,040
we wanted to make sure that we had

328
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,320
service providers to make sure people

329
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
could speak online but that's

330
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,279
a huge disincentive for anybody to go to

331
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,440
not go into that business because if you

332
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
go into the business and the law runs

333
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
through you're in trouble might be game

334
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
over

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
there was also a second problem which is

336
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
prodigy was trying to actually run sort

337
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,519
of curated community and they were

338
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,680
advertising you know we try to clean

339
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
stuff up and get rid of the bad stuff

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
and the judge had used that

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
advertisement and held it against them

342
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
it was it was sort of like if you didn't

343
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
know the crap was there maybe you

344
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
wouldn't be in trouble for it because

345
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
you tried to know what what crap was on

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
your system and you got it wrong that's

347
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,079
why we're going to hold you liable and

348
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
that was the theory of liability and the

349
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,600
congressmen were like well this is no

350
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,399
good

351
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
the internet is coming people are using

352
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,839
it and some of them are using it in bad

353
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,680
ways we need to make sure that the

354
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
platforms can be in a position to help

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,519
us get rid of the bad stuff as well as

356
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
be available to help us get the goods

357
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,920
down

358
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,959
anyway

359
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,240
these two things collided uh the outrage

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
against the porn and the concern about

361
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,200
this case and it formed the

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
communications decency act

363
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
then there was litigation challenging

364
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
the communications decency act because

365
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
trying to ban the porn is not a

366
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,360
particularly constitutional thing under

367
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
the first amendment so we had a case

368
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
called reno versus aclu

369
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
which had the effect of striking down

370
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
most of the communications decency act

371
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,839
because it's not consistent with the

372
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,720
first amendment um but what got left

373
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,600
standing was section 230 that had got

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,839
gotten bolted onto it as part of the

375
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,760
reaction to the strata and oakland case

376
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
so here we are section 230 now exists

377
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
all right so we're going into our scenic

378
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,079
tour here uh don't panic this is all

379
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,920
readable i'll explain

380
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,480
but one thing i wanted to flag is people

381
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
keep talking about how section 230 is a

382
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
gift to big tech and you will notice in

383
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
all the statutory texts including the

384
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
bits that i'm not even showing you

385
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,279
nowhere does the word big tech show up

386
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,160
and that's important this is a very

387
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,800
broad agnostically

388
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
drafted statute and that's part of its

389
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
power and that's something that we mess

390
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
with at our apparel at this point

391
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,360
all right so the statute opens up with

392
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,000
subsection a and some section b and i'm

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
just going to scroll through these words

394
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,959
really quickly

395
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
because what they basically amount to is

396
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
congress declaring that it is found that

397
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
the internet is a pretty cool thing

398
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,639
and it is the policy of the united

399
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,800
states to keep it the cool thing um but

400
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
they were also worried about the hygiene

401
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
of online to wanting to make sure that

402
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
like the bad stuff could be minimized

403
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,959
and so you have this sort of preamble

404
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
type text at the beginning of section

405
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
230 announcing that

406
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,480
the rest of section 230 is in

407
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
furtherance of that goal that i had

408
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
basically already told you it boils down

409
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
to we want the most good stuff online

410
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
and the least bad stuff online and

411
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
everything that section 230s keen

412
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,880
language does is designed to make sure

413
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,120
we can achieve both goals as best as we

414
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,880
can

415
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,760
all right

416
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,720
this is the core section of section 230

417
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
i'll leave it up there

418
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
um i have tried to read it aloud at

419
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,959
talks before but i

420
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,800
it really sounds ugly when i just try to

421
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
pronounce it so go ahead and

422
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
take a moment to read it um it has been

423
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,240
called the 26 words that has created the

424
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,279
internet

425
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,000
uh

426
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
well read in any way no provider of an

427
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
interactive computer service shall be

428
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,920
treated as the publisher or speaker of

429
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,240
any information provided by another

430
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
information content provider and i

431
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
highlighted those two terms because they

432
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,600
are the key bits and the key bits are

433
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,639
defined

434
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,800
over here

435
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
so let's drop down to the bottom one

436
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,839
first

437
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,279
the information content provider

438
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,279
this is who

439
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
wrote the content created the content

440
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
uh imbued the content with its

441
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
potentially wrongful character um

442
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,680
whoever

443
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
wrote this communicated it expressed it

444
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
what that statue said in those 26 words

445
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
is okay

446
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
it didn't change the fact that those

447
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,480
people are still going to be responsible

448
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,959
for what they put online

449
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
what it did say is that bit in number

450
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,399
two

451
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,720
the interactive computer service the

452
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
platform the facilitator the helper

453
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
who facilitated that expression from the

454
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,720
information content provider they are

455
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,199
not going to be held liable for it um

456
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,959
this basically means you hold the

457
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,880
creator responsible but not the

458
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,519
facilitator responsible and this is the

459
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
key and the power of section 230 that

460
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
has allowed all these services you know

461
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
over 20 plus years to come up rise up we

462
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,480
have an internet economy

463
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
exchange of information everything good

464
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,519
about the internet has been facilitated

465
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
and enabled because we have this basic

466
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
framework built into section 230.

467
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,600
there is actually i don't want to make

468
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
this point i'm just going to go back to

469
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
slide so interactive computer service

470
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
remember i said that um you don't see

471
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
big time

472
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,760
in there it just kind of describes that

473
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
it's providing a service sometimes i

474
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
call it a platform sometimes i call it

475
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,039
you know

476
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
an isp or something like that

477
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,000
but

478
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
it's kind of broad in terms of who it

479
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
applies to and yeah okay it's going to

480
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
cover

481
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,599
quote-unquote big tech it's going to

482
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,839
cover our social media platforms in some

483
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,439
ways that's pretty easy to kind of see

484
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
how that would work like twitter is full

485
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,319
of

486
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,240
tweets which are user-generated content

487
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
twitter's not writing the tweets the

488
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,120
users are

489
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
um it covers things like consumer

490
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
reviews sites

491
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
it covers e-commerce platforms although

492
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
there's some litigation these days

493
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
challenging to what extent it does but

494
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,120
it does it does if you read the statute

495
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
it should protect e-commerce platforms

496
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
and there's case law that says that it

497
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,120
does

498
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,000
comment sections on online newspapers

499
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,760
search engines because what is a search

500
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,640
engine doing but listing content that

501
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,559
somebody else created

502
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,880
payment providers who are facilitating

503
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,120
things that somebody else provided

504
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,080
email providers isps including broadband

505
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
providers backend services traditional

506
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
bulletin boards and you

507
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
individuals this is one of the things

508
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
that frustrates me with all the the big

509
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,320
tech hate that and people like oh i

510
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,919
don't like the big text so let's get rid

511
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,600
of section 230.

512
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,080
it doesn't have any criteria for how big

513
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
the platform needs to be it can be a

514
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
google or facebook but it can also be a

515
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
wikimedia which is non-profit and it can

516
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,640
be an individual blog that takes

517
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
comments it can be your own facebook

518
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,679
pages where you have comments on your

519
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,640
posts

520
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
and it basically means that if somebody

521
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,280
comes onto your facebook page and writes

522
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,360
something in one of your comments that's

523
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,400
terrible

524
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,679
um

525
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,080
you're not liable for the crap that they

526
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,200
just put on

527
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
as a comment on your post

528
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
same as if you deleted it because it was

529
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
ugly they can't sue you for having

530
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
deleted it either because it gives you

531
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,720
protection in both ways just as it gives

532
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,120
a bigger corporate player protection for

533
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
leaving stuff up and taking stuff down

534
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
there is this complimentary provision at

535
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
c2 the the big one was at subsection c1

536
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,160
c2 speaks a little bit more directly to

537
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
that bit about taking stuff down

538
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,640
um and the moderation

539
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,360
of faculty that platforms often have

540
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,400
um

541
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,080
what's interesting is as the law has

542
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
been on the books

543
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,919
c1 actually has had the effect of

544
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,080
providing the protection for moderating

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,880
behavior um but there's a lot of you'll

546
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,559
hear people squealing when they don't

547
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
like section 230 especially when they

548
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
don't like the moderation that platforms

549
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,600
are doing they'll squeal about c2 and

550
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
what they're

551
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,000
they tend to hone in on and i

552
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,240
highlighted is the bit about or

553
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
otherwise objectionable because what

554
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,600
that basically means is it gives a big

555
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
broad brush for yeah you can take stuff

556
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
down for pretty much any reason that you

557
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
would think it's um is necessary and if

558
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,480
you go back and think of the example of

559
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,320
your own facebook post of somebody's

560
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
posted a comment on your site

561
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
and you don't like it you know

562
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
you would feel weird if you couldn't

563
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,799
take it down without creating liability

564
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
if somebody come and posted an ugly

565
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
comment on a picture of your kid like

566
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
you know you wouldn't want to like have

567
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,520
some law pressure you or the potential

568
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
high legal stakes

569
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,520
driving your decision of whether you had

570
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,080
you could take it down or not so

571
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,600
there's a broad brush built into the

572
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
statute although some of it is not just

573
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,480
this section that's the other one that

574
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,679
we looked at earlier so we're kind of at

575
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,240
a midpoint um so i want to highlight

576
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
some of the other things built into the

577
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
statute because that also drives some of

578
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
the policy and how well it works or in

579
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
some instances how well it doesn't work

580
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,039
and here is a kid in picture because i

581
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,679
think you you've earned one here you go

582
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,120
all right

583
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
so they put into section 230 at the

584
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
outset a couple of

585
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,320
like asterisk type sections um

586
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,159
one of the things was there was some

587
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,559
concern that section 230 might interact

588
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,880
with another law called ekba

589
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,240
and they didn't know how it would

590
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,679
interact so they basically wrote a

591
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
provision that said don't worry about it

592
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
they don't mess with each other

593
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,039
no issues here and as far as i know

594
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,480
there really hasn't been any litigation

595
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,640
about this in 20 years so they stuck it

596
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
in it's in the statutes part of your

597
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
scenic tour but let's ignore it because

598
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
it hasn't been that important

599
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
this bit has been imported

600
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,039
um this is what's called a preemption

601
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
provision and a preemption provision

602
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,400
basically says

603
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
um

604
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
uh

605
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,360
it means that the states don't get to

606
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
mess with this in fact that's pretty

607
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
much what that provision actually

608
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,640
literally says the states don't get to

609
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
mess with it because if you think about

610
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
the internet

611
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,799
um

612
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
you know if you have a i mean i'm

613
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,320
sitting in one state right now talking

614
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,840
to you and

615
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
i have no idea where you are but you're

616
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
not here you're somewhere else and

617
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
probably in another state so this is

618
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,039
crossing state lines even though right

619
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,640
now i'm doing all my expression

620
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
currently in this one particular state

621
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,840
and may be governed by this particular

622
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,039
state's laws

623
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,840
um

624
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
you know this is

625
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,840
an interstate business and we can't have

626
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
each individual state come up with its

627
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
own rules of the road because how would

628
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,120
we function like i don't know if what

629
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
i'm saying might be illegal in your

630
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,679
state where you're sitting um i you know

631
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
would this platform get in trouble they

632
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
don't you know kind of deal with

633
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
different rules that may be in conflict

634
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
with each other

635
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,799
um so congress basically said get out of

636
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,200
this business if it comes to regulating

637
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
the internet so we get the most good

638
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,960
stuff and the least bad stuff online

639
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
this is our job and you don't get to

640
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,240
create your own state law that changes

641
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,840
that policy balance as we've achieved it

642
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,520
this is important but you'll start to

643
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,000
see in some of the latest news as people

644
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
you know

645
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,240
get cranky and start to challenge

646
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
section 230 that some of the states kind

647
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
of are trying to change

648
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
and create their own local rules of the

649
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,000
road but you also see some of the

650
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
problems when they do because if you

651
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
think about our current political

652
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
alignment and you think about the rules

653
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
of the road that a florida or a texas

654
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
keeps trying to impose on the internet

655
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
and compare them with the types of rules

656
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
of the road that california or new york

657
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
is going to prefer

658
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,799
i think the conflicts start to become

659
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
apparent like you couldn't please

660
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,159
everybody and so that's why it's a

661
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
mistake for any of the states to try

662
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,000
this is a key carve out so section 230

663
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
basically means

664
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
that whoever

665
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
gave the content in question it's

666
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,799
allegedly wrongful quality is

667
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,520
responsible for it in any number of ways

668
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,679
that the content could be wrongful

669
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,679
because the statute isn't specific but

670
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,080
here's a way that it does get specific

671
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
this section basically means if the

672
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
thing that is arguably wrong with the

673
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,400
content is that it violates

674
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
an or

675
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,520
let's just summarize it as it violates

676
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,279
an intellectual property right then

677
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,760
section 230 is of no use to the platform

678
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,559
whatsoever um

679
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,600
now

680
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
to some extent well actually so what

681
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
does this mean

682
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
functionally for us this generally means

683
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,880
that it might be infringing a copyright

684
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
because that's the thing that we all

685
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,559
hear about all the time so what happens

686
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
if that if that happens well we go to

687
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,279
the good news for platforms is they

688
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,679
still get some protection not from

689
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,679
section 230 which gives a pretty robust

690
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,120
immunity but instead they go to

691
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
section 512 of the digital millennium

692
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,919
copyright act and that provides a system

693
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,799
of safe harbors now i put this slide in

694
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,159
knowing you're not going to be able to

695
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
read it because this is a bit of

696
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
language articulating how the safe

697
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,720
harbors work and the problem is

698
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,000
it's complicated unclear conditional and

699
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,159
what starts to happen is platforms end

700
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,320
up obliterated just trying to litigate

701
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,559
whether the safe harbor applied to them

702
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,039
in the first place at which point it's

703
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,200
of no use whatsoever because if you have

704
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
to endure the lawsuit you might as well

705
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
have just been arguing on the merits

706
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
you're gonna get blood drive from lawyer

707
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,360
fees and i say this with all apologies i

708
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,279
am a lawyer um and by the way i am a

709
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
lawyer not your lawyer none of this

710
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,320
should be taken as legal advice but um

711
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,039
you

712
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,279
this is not good um i mean better to

713
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,279
have the safe harbor system

714
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
no safe harbor system but it's very very

715
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
conditional not particularly useful and

716
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
doesn't really give platforms much

717
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
protection and the consequence of that

718
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,200
is that

719
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
the internet keeps becoming swiss cheese

720
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
because you keep going like to youtube

721
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,720
and you see all the

722
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
you know this video is not available

723
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,559
thanks to a copyright claim

724
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,559
and that's because the platforms are in

725
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,480
a position that if somebody sends the

726
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
take down notice

727
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,799
it is a not particularly viable to look

728
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,279
and see whether um you know try to

729
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,039
evaluate whether it's a legitimate take

730
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,200
down notice or not um

731
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
even if they could catch it given the

732
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
huge volume they're not necessarily

733
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
going to know because they're not going

734
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,039
to have the information to know who's

735
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,039
the copyright owner who's the licensee

736
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,960
is there for use or anything like that

737
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,600
so it's not a particularly they can't

738
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,440
police it effectively and they can't

739
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,960
evaluate the takedown notices for

740
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,279
whether they're bogus or not um

741
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,320
and if they get it wrong or they ignore

742
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,159
one because they think it might not be

743
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,600
legitimate they may lose their safe

744
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,679
harbor entirely and end up in sorts of

745
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,640
trouble

746
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
where even if they're exonerated at the

747
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
end they're going to be spending a ton

748
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,679
of money on lawyers um and they may get

749
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,760
obliterated in the process and i want to

750
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
just mention a case called um

751
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,720
shelter capital versus

752
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,400
umg actually it's the other way around

753
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,720
umg versus shelter capital

754
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,120
and this was about um

755
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,880
a video hosting service called veo

756
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,960
networks which at the time was a

757
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,120
competitor to youtube

758
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,840
that ended up getting challenged for

759
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,200
whether it had

760
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,159
a valid claim to the safe harbor and in

761
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,159
the process of litigating to find out

762
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,080
that ultimately yes it indeed was

763
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,520
protected by the safe harbor and could

764
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
not be held liable for their users a

765
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
legend of

766
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
infringement

767
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,159
they went bankrupt so they don't exist

768
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,679
and now we're a little bit upset that

769
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,279
youtube doesn't have enough competitors

770
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,480
but one of the reasons it doesn't have

771
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
enough competitors is because we

772
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,840
obliterated

773
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,440
competitors and made sure that it

774
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
couldn't grow and exist

775
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,159
and be present in in the present as

776
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,840
another potential platform and

777
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,919
alternative to youtube

778
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,640
so

779
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,399
better to have the dmca than not but

780
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,159
it's not as good as section 230 working

781
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,520
on its own

782
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,960
another key carve out is um

783
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
if the thing wrong with the content is

784
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
that it violated federal criminal law

785
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,919
then also no section 230 would apply um

786
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,440
and this

787
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
um

788
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,840
this basically covers like the the

789
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,399
ugliest of the sex crime things that

790
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
happened it covered the child porn and

791
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
um

792
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
it covered a lot of the sexual

793
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,399
exploitation um even of other people so

794
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,240
we already had something that if the

795
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
thing that was wrong with the content is

796
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
it

797
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
may have federal criminal liability

798
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
section 230 also wasn't useful and that

799
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
meant that the platforms kind of had to

800
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,679
do what they could to police the content

801
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,760
but he gave him a very specific focus

802
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
look for this really heinous stuff where

803
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,640
real people are getting hurt and um you

804
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,039
know you can spend your policing energy

805
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
on that and focus on it and do a better

806
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,720
job because we're not making you have to

807
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
worry about all sorts of other things

808
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,440
that could potentially be wrong with the

809
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,880
content

810
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
but then

811
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
some people decided that wasn't good

812
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,600
enough and

813
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
they

814
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,360
a couple years ago passed a law that is

815
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
sometimes referred to as sesta but more

816
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,159
frequently called foster just go with

817
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,080
foster the way the sausage got made that

818
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
was the name that ended up

819
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
finally lasting

820
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,640
and they decided they wanted to go after

821
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,360
speech related to sex trafficking more

822
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,840
specifically so if

823
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
in theory if the thing that was wrong

824
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,200
with the user generated content was that

825
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,720
it was in furtherance of the sex

826
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
trafficking again

827
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,360
section 230 wouldn't apply but the

828
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,600
problem is well there's a number of

829
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,760
problems with this one of the things is

830
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,640
that

831
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,520
um

832
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,279
i have it on the screen and i know i

833
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,360
told you don't be afraid of the legalese

834
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,279
be afraid of this particular legalese

835
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,200
i'm afraid of this legalese and i in

836
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
theory can read it it's not very

837
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
readable to understand exactly what um

838
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,320
where the liability falls and what the

839
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,440
platforms need to do or not do um

840
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
and the problem with it being that

841
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,559
unclear

842
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,240
is it led to a whole bunch of platforms

843
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,080
getting out of the speech facilitation

844
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
business so craigslist for instance took

845
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,240
down its online personals i mean

846
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,679
personals have been up since the

847
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,440
beginning people have met married had

848
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
kids and happy lives through the through

849
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,760
the internet through online through

850
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,679
craigslist online personals and

851
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,360
craigslist is like this has got some

852
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,440
adult stuff and adults being adults with

853
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
each other and

854
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,279
that may create liability for us under

855
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,880
this and we can't be sure so we just

856
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
can't the chance and so it took off this

857
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
whole swath of legal speech from the

858
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,640
internet because we've now gutted the

859
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,799
liability provisions that section 230

860
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,000
had and we got to them in a way that

861
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
doesn't just create the risk of civil

862
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,559
liability but also potentially criminal

863
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,320
the other thing is that even for sex

864
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,159
workers who arguably you know applying

865
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,679
their trade may be

866
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,840
legal under whatever local jurisdiction

867
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
they're acting

868
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
it meant that the providers who they

869
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,679
were depending on to apply their trade

870
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,000
safely so that they could screen their

871
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,240
potential customers for instance and

872
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,320
turn down the ones who were making them

873
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
uncomfortable

874
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
those platforms went away they went away

875
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,919
because they're like well this seems to

876
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,760
put us in the crosshairs of a lot of

877
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,679
trouble and i'm sorry we just can't

878
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
facilitate you know and provide you the

879
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,120
tools so you could play your trade

880
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,240
safely so that drove sex workers into

881
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,360
the streets where they are dying this

882
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,679
foster has a body count literally

883
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,000
because it's taken away these online

884
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
services who helped them express

885
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
themselves in the way they needed to

886
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,720
express themselves

887
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,519
we took it away we ruined lawful speech

888
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,440
and we drove people into a dangerous

889
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,080
world that the internet was no longer

890
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,360
giving them the tools that they could

891
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
make safer for themselves

892
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,720
so

893
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,799
those are the big things to point out in

894
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,120
the statute and i'm gonna wrap up with

895
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,799
some closing odds and then open it up

896
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,720
for questions and if nobody has

897
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,080
questions i will toss out a couple of

898
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,039
their ideas um

899
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,720
ideas to hold on to

900
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,320
we talked about it a couple times

901
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,399
remember how cripplingly expensive a

902
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,240
lawsuit is if you need to call the

903
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,840
lawyer to find out what to do with this

904
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
letter you're probably running four

905
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,279
digits if he actually needs to do

906
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,880
something about it now you're in five

907
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,399
digits and if you're going to court

908
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
you're into six and seven digits

909
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,919
potentially so

910
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,519
you know if you think about how many

911
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,120
things can go wrong given the amount of

912
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,559
user generated content you're

913
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,640
facilitating

914
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
that's not controllable that's not

915
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,480
something you can budget and it it can

916
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
make going into these businesses of

917
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,399
providing online services which are

918
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,559
generally a good thing in many ways they

919
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,640
are a good thing um and we were trying

920
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,799
to have when we passed section 230 it

921
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
makes it a non-viable business

922
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,080
um

923
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,200
second

924
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
uh remember that section 230 doesn't

925
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,919
really do more than the first event

926
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,279
would it just makes that bundle of

927
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,080
expressive associative rights meaningful

928
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
no point being you know having the

929
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,679
rights on your side if you still have to

930
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,760
go to court and get blood dry and legal

931
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
costs to try to defend them i mean there

932
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
is a point but at scale this is not

933
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,480
going to be a viable business model

934
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,720
um remember again the goal is to have

935
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
the most good stuff online and the least

936
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,279
bad

937
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
any policy needs to optimize for both

938
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,720
and shooting for only one tends to

939
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,200
compromise the other so sometimes people

940
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,600
will argue well we only want to put more

941
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
pressure on what should be moderated

942
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,279
we're not going to create liability if

943
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,360
you host the thing in the first place it

944
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,880
doesn't really have that practical

945
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
effect if you're sort of putting legal

946
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
pressure on a platform or co-opted

947
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
resources

948
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
which no matter how rich it is it's

949
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
still inherently scarce like there's

950
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,000
only so much in that kitty um

951
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,039
you are

952
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
typing them to make decisions that are

953
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,600
not going to be conducive to the you

954
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,000
want to be have them be as available to

955
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,159
users as possible you want them to

956
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,480
invest in their ui you want them to

957
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,399
um you know make sure their uptime is

958
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,080
better like you

959
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,519
spend their money for them and the

960
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,279
result isn't good even if you were only

961
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,919
focusing on one part of the equation

962
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,000
another thing the second bullet remember

963
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,080
that we won't all agree on what counts

964
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,519
as the good stuff and what counts as the

965
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,440
bad and the first amendment tells us we

966
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
don't have to and that is not good to

967
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,720
have law that tries to pressure us to

968
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,559
we can see that with all the people who

969
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,399
are screaming at each other people on

970
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,080
the right are screaming about exactly

971
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
the opposite things that people on the

972
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
left are screaming about this is our

973
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000
irreconcilable and if we have law that

974
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,919
is trying to force platforms into impos

975
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,480
to somehow mediate these impossible

976
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,120
um paradoxes it's not going to work and

977
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,360
the first amendment is basically exists

978
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,279
to get the government and law out of the

979
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,320
business of pressuring those decisions

980
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,000
again regulating via carrots um is

981
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,960
is

982
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
a viable option and much more effective

983
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,639
than if we regulated by sticks um

984
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,800
we want the most effective thing um we

985
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
want to make it that platforms can do

986
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,918
the best that they can that we've got

987
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,159
their resources in ways that may not be

988
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,839
conducive for what their users really

989
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,520
truly need what the internet at large

990
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
truly needs

991
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,399
and um

992
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,440
uh yeah let's not do that um and i want

993
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,079
to add one other thing just because um

994
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
it's come up in some other talks

995
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,280
it isn't to say that we don't have

996
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,520
problems with lots of content out there

997
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,119
on the internet

998
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,879
what i was starting to say is the issue

999
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,480
is the role that the state can or should

1000
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,679
have been trying to solve them

1001
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,440
especially in light of the first

1002
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,560
amendment and its importance to

1003
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,000
upholding democratic principles

1004
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,599
when people can control the speech they

1005
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,159
can control criticism and

1006
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
you know i'm

1007
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,280
we need to give the platforms the space

1008
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,639
and the freedom to do the best that they

1009
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,240
can to build the best communities they

1010
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,000
can to foster the most diverse ideas

1011
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,440
that can and

1012
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,960
innovate the solutions to the problems

1013
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
that we're complaining about today if we

1014
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,800
take away that freedom we won't get the

1015
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,079
solutions we'll just bake in the

1016
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,079
problems and create some more

1017
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,640
so that is the reason that section 230

1018
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,240
is lovely and wonderful and we should

1019
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,640
not mess with it at all um except for

1020
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
perhaps like getting rid of the ip

1021
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,040
exemption and rolling back fosta so with

1022
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
that i will escape so i can see people

1023
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,640
again and

1024
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,280
say goodbye to the kitty and here we go

1025
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,440
so

1026
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,839
uh

1027
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,000
are you there alan

1028
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,440
i am yes okay can you see me

1029
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
i am pressing

1030
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,480
buttons and

1031
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,920
um okay i found a button i can see me i

1032
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,119
can see you

1033
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
okay perfect okay there we go okay so

1034
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
where are we so

1035
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
um okay so we got one comment uh just

1036
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,119
about foster just saying that the

1037
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,359
agreeing with with with you what you

1038
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,839
said is is the negative impact on this

1039
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,640
on the safety sex workers

1040
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,320
uh is incredibly frustrating um

1041
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,960
then we also got a earlier question from

1042
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
from megan uh do you think that section

1043
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,200
230 addresses the issue of hostile or

1044
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
hate speech or medical disinformation

1045
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,359
being amplified by platform algorithms

1046
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,440
is there a better way that those

1047
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,880
problems could be addressed

1048
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,359
so

1049
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,560
this gets back to the idea that

1050
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
section 230 works in a way that is

1051
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
somewhat counter-intuitive to us because

1052
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,480
we're used to punitive based laws of

1053
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
thou shalt not

1054
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,440
but you really can't do that in the

1055
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
speech space because the first amendment

1056
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,359
says that congress cannot make laws

1057
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,520
about thou shalt not when it comes to

1058
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,119
expression

1059
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,680
so what we need is essentially to make

1060
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
sure that the platforms are in a world

1061
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,359
where there's other sorts of pressures

1062
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,000
that will help drive the healthiest

1063
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,599
decisions that they can make and we

1064
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,000
already have that world um we just don't

1065
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,040
always

1066
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,839
think we do

1067
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
um to be a little glib it's sort of the

1068
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,400
marketplace of ideas um

1069
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,280
notion but it's also kind of

1070
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,000
platforms do have a vested interest in

1071
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,079
not pissing off their users because they

1072
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,880
would

1073
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,800
like to actually continue to have users

1074
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
because if they don't have users they're

1075
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,800
not going to have a business now

1076
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
sometimes we look at these platforms and

1077
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,079
get frustrated because it doesn't look

1078
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,880
like they're being adequately responsive

1079
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
to

1080
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
these pressures and maybe are taking

1081
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,160
their users for granted and i think two

1082
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,960
things are occurring one is they are

1083
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,040
being glib sometimes i mean i'm a

1084
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,720
defender of the internet i'm a defender

1085
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,520
of platforms but i facepalm constantly

1086
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
like

1087
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,680
facebook what i don't even

1088
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,119
you know there's a lot of criticism that

1089
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,839
they are fairly do on the other hand

1090
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,760
sometimes they are in positions that are

1091
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,680
a lot more nuanced and complex with

1092
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,599
competing pressures including

1093
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,280
even expressive type pressures that are

1094
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,800
driving their decisions and forcing

1095
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,880
their hands in certain ways um

1096
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
i mean

1097
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,839
i have some colleagues who talk about

1098
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,480
how content moderation at scale is

1099
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,839
really impossible even the most

1100
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,440
well-meaning platform that really wants

1101
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,680
to cultivate their their online

1102
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
community as effectively as they can are

1103
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,119
gonna run into situations that

1104
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,400
particularly when

1105
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,079
these moderation decisions are happening

1106
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,240
at speed and at scale they're gonna get

1107
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
stuff wrong

1108
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,119
and it kind of sucks when they get it

1109
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,200
wrong but it is very difficult to handle

1110
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,640
the volume on the internet and not get

1111
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,960
it wrong at all what we can basically do

1112
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,440
is kind of like try to gently what is it

1113
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
going to take for them to get it right

1114
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,040
most often

1115
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,599
and i put to you this is section 230

1116
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
because it takes away the punitive

1117
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
things that would skew their decisions

1118
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,560
so they can afford to do the best they

1119
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,480
can or piss off their users at their

1120
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,440
peril

1121
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,680
the other thing is so some people will

1122
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,440
say well

1123
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
they're too big and they don't have

1124
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
effective competition

1125
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,480
all right there's a lot wrapped up into

1126
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
that idea some of which i'm gonna kick

1127
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,720
the can on but

1128
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
if you think they are too big and

1129
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,640
powerful and you don't like this one

1130
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,960
make sure you can get another one so i

1131
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,200
talk about the story of shel of veo

1132
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
networks getting obliterated

1133
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
and now we don't have a competitor to

1134
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,480
youtube to do

1135
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
user hosted videos better than youtube

1136
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,359
does

1137
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,040
well it might have been nice if we'd

1138
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,079
actually made sure that a startup could

1139
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,560
launch start and continue to exist so it

1140
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,160
could be an alternative and make

1141
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
alternative choices so if youtube's

1142
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,079
getting it wrong that's okay because we

1143
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,680
don't have to go to youtube anymore we

1144
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,400
can go to

1145
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,520
www.youtube.com and host our videos over

1146
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
there because they're doing a better job

1147
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,320
um

1148
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,000
the more we think that there's too much

1149
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
entrenchment the more important it is to

1150
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,320
make sure we have the legal ecosystem

1151
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
with that will allow other services and

1152
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,000
competition to come to bear where um

1153
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
you know you know we don't have to worry

1154
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
about so much it won't matter so much if

1155
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,119
youtube is getting it wrong because

1156
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,480
somebody else might be able to exist to

1157
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,200
get it right okay

1158
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
um all right so there's another question

1159
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,319
from suzette um

1160
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,079
how is

1161
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,000
the platform's use of protection from

1162
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,240
230 potentially impacted if they are

1163
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,680
directed by federal level institutions

1164
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,319
to remove posts or users from multiple

1165
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,640
outlets

1166
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,000
so i guess

1167
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
federal level institutions jumping in

1168
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,920
and

1169
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
fiddling

1170
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,240
i didn't fully understand the question

1171
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,839
that's also a little obliterated for me

1172
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,599
but um

1173
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,839
one of the latest ideas getting pushed

1174
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,040
around is that the moderation decisions

1175
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,119
so a platform has the first amendment

1176
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,599
right to moderate how it sees fit and i

1177
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,440
explained like vis-a-vis your own

1178
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,520
facebook posts why that would be so and

1179
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
why that might seem right if you go from

1180
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,599
like the small scale to

1181
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,440
well you know facebook is just a lot of

1182
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
individual people that like it's a

1183
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,400
larger platform

1184
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,480
um

1185
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
it

1186
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,640
they can make those decisions freely and

1187
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,720
there should section 230 and the first

1188
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,319
amendment say there's no liability for

1189
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,880
how they make it and even people who

1190
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,280
get upset that their stuff or themselves

1191
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,760
and their entire accounts got taken down

1192
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,119
i mean sometimes maybe it's a bad

1193
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,119
decision worth criticism but it isn't a

1194
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,440
question of law if there's not oh

1195
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,880
they're not legally the platforms are

1196
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,319
not legally liable for making those

1197
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,839
decisions they have the right to be

1198
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,520
arbitrary and stupid about these

1199
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,440
decisions if they want and you know

1200
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,319
other pressures say be less stupid but

1201
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,079
legally they're fine

1202
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,240
the problem then comes up of what if

1203
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,119
it's not really their own decisions and

1204
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,760
what if there's other forms of pressure

1205
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,920
that are driving the decisions and these

1206
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,359
are the things

1207
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,680
that we're starting to play with now

1208
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,359
what i don't like is that a lot of the

1209
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,079
discourse is

1210
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,240
just not clued in enough like a lot of

1211
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,680
people are like state action here state

1212
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
action there and it's like

1213
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,760
no that's not what's going on

1214
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,440
but you know then we're getting things

1215
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,560
like the most recent thing was like um

1216
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,400
president biden's administration

1217
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
pointing out things that didn't look so

1218
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,640
good on facebook

1219
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,359
now i think in that particular instance

1220
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,359
it was okay

1221
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,400
because

1222
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,800
sometimes what the platforms will do is

1223
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
they want to make good they want to

1224
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,960
exercise their right to make moderation

1225
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,280
decisions in the way that

1226
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,880
is as good as possible and they'll look

1227
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,800
to various authorities to help inform

1228
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,880
them what is good and some of those

1229
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,400
authorities are there's expertise in the

1230
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,240
federal government and they want to plug

1231
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,160
into that expertise it is their choice

1232
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,079
to plug into that expertise they can

1233
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,359
choose to accept it they can choose to

1234
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,040
reject it but that is their choice so

1235
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,319
the mere fact that the federal

1236
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,920
government is then providing that

1237
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,079
expertise to them doesn't make it state

1238
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,200
action

1239
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,359
but what people were concerned about is

1240
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,800
is this an offer they could really

1241
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,839
refuse

1242
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,720
like

1243
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,280
yeah nice nice uh information you got

1244
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,520
going there and like you know

1245
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
if they can reject the binding

1246
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,920
administration suggestions at no peril

1247
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,560
to themselves no state action

1248
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,079
the problem is there's a lot of

1249
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,839
enforcement stuff going on particularly

1250
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,440
like antitrust that's hitting the big

1251
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,200
platforms at the same time that they're

1252
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,599
also sending suggestions for things that

1253
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,359
maybe should stay up and should stay

1254
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,599
down or and that's putting the platforms

1255
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,079
in a slightly uncomfortable position

1256
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,640
if they freely say no at no peril to

1257
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,240
themselves it's not state action when

1258
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,640
biden like you know gives us top 10

1259
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,839
favorite facebook posts not an

1260
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,200
issue the question is whether that's

1261
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,880
really the case or not and i don't

1262
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
entirely know how to answer it i tend to

1263
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,640
give that particular announcement a

1264
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,119
little bit more leeway but i don't

1265
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,119
always see enough understanding of how

1266
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,119
this entire balanced echo system works

1267
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,880
even coming out of the government

1268
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,440
um congress it's their bill it's their

1269
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,800
law and they don't understand how it

1270
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,880
works the federal government

1271
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,800
you know or is enforcing around

1272
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
reactionary outrage without really

1273
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
understanding the mechanics of what do

1274
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,119
you want more of and then how do you

1275
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,040
incentivize to get more of it but how do

1276
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,160
you also make make sure that you don't

1277
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,839
you know kill your golden goose or

1278
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,839
accidentally create an ecosystem that is

1279
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,560
going to force more of what you hate and

1280
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,720
most of the reform proposals and the

1281
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,560
outrage and the reactionary things i see

1282
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,400
from both parties

1283
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,240
doesn't understand enough of the history

1284
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,480
and the mechanics and the realities of

1285
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,240
what it would take to actually provide a

1286
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,880
platform that facilitates user speech

1287
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,319
they get it wrong and um so their fixes

1288
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,800
aren't fixes even their reform ideas

1289
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,079
tend to be

1290
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,599
you've just gutted it because now you've

1291
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599
exposed the platform to unlimited

1292
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,920
litigation and that's gonna that's gonna

1293
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,160
leave a mark

1294
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,440
uh

1295
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,599
megan's megan's question because she

1296
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,000
mentioned um algorithm and that that is

1297
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,839
something that that i was wondering

1298
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,200
about so

1299
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,560
um

1300
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,000
the the idea in my mind that of 230 is

1301
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,640
is that um the way it was described to

1302
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,440
me originally is is that uh the internet

1303
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,520
has run more like a telephone system

1304
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,240
than a publishing house so publishers uh

1305
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,079
get involved and they choose what can

1306
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,359
and can't happen

1307
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,599
whereas like a telephone system you know

1308
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,000
the telephone guys have no idea what's

1309
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,839
going on in their system so they just

1310
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,760
let things go through

1311
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,560
um

1312
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,800
the the idea generally with with the

1313
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,000
internet in the early days was that um

1314
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
you know everyone had their own website

1315
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,319
running on their own

1316
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,920
site and and

1317
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,040
you didn't

1318
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
your isp didn't know what was going on

1319
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,920
and the hosting company didn't care um

1320
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,640
but the idea now is is that the likes of

1321
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,880
especially youtube um is one that i'm

1322
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,680
aware of that they get involved because

1323
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,200
now they control our algorithms and if

1324
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,480
they like your youtube video for certain

1325
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,720
reasons which may or may not be a good

1326
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
thing um

1327
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,599
if

1328
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,680
uh that they could drive it to the top

1329
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,599
of the list and when people search for

1330
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,160
it it'll pop up first

1331
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,440
it might be something that they

1332
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,960
recommend uh based on other videos etc

1333
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,160
um

1334
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,480
so the question there is is that the i

1335
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
is is that youtube in that case is

1336
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,280
starting to become more involved in the

1337
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,640
actual

1338
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,319
um delivery of of the information um and

1339
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,160
they they're you know they're not

1340
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,319
totally uh

1341
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,599
um

1342
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,400
disinvolved or uninvolved in in in the

1343
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,880
whole process

1344
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,280
so um a couple of things um

1345
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,240
couple things one sometimes you'll hear

1346
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,599
people say well they're acting like a

1347
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,520
publisher not a platform just ignore

1348
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,720
that that's

1349
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,960
wrong that's that's not a meaningful

1350
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,839
decision um that language publisher is

1351
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,760
sort of a thing that kind of got

1352
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,280
articulated

1353
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,440
as section 230 ended up on the books and

1354
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,800
went through some of the earlier court

1355
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,480
cases because a lot of it was like

1356
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,200
putting fundamental first amendment

1357
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,119
principles into sort of a more

1358
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,400
practically

1359
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,160
useful form by putting it into the

1360
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,400
statute and there was some courts were

1361
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,520
getting their head around it by

1362
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,680
understanding things and that concept

1363
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,839
um but there was never a role for

1364
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,640
neutrality um i mean like think of the

1365
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,480
bookstore a bookstore

1366
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,920
you to hold them liable for what is in

1367
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,079
one of the books they sell because they

1368
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,240
chose to sell it like it's a little

1369
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,720
easier to see that that's not cool and

1370
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,800
so section 230

1371
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,839
doesn't it doesn't the algorithm and the

1372
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,359
recommendation engine is essentially

1373
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,720
kind of like choosing what books to

1374
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,240
stock in your bookstore and it doesn't

1375
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
jeopardize the section 230 protection at

1376
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,160
all um

1377
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,000
and there was no rule about being

1378
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,119
neutral

1379
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,559
now it sounds kind of counter-intuitive

1380
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,079
because you're kind of like well you're

1381
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,760
you're accentuating certain things and

1382
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,319
de-accentuating other things but i use

1383
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,240
that phrase and granted it's my phrase

1384
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,160
and courts haven't really used it but i

1385
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,559
think it tends to boil down to this and

1386
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,359
a case called force be facebook

1387
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,119
um is actually a great case that talks

1388
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,040
about the algorithms and also what i'm

1389
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,760
about to say which is that

1390
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,520
section 230 makes the most sense when

1391
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,400
you focused on who imbued the content

1392
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,559
with its wrongful quality

1393
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,079
um there's an earlier case called

1394
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,319
roommates.com and roommates.com focused

1395
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,960
on who created the content but i think

1396
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,599
that that gets us part way but i think

1397
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,280
it's more than who created it because a

1398
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,640
platform kind of has a somewhat

1399
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,640
symbiotic relationship and causing

1400
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,480
content to be created and so people get

1401
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,160
confused and like you created you

1402
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,920
created it it's like saying twitter

1403
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,119
helped create the tweets because they

1404
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,480
gave him the ui

1405
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,640
the ui that said tweet this now

1406
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,040
it has to be something more who prompted

1407
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,280
the thing that was wrongful or allegedly

1408
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,359
wrongful about the content

1409
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,920
if it's the platform then 230 doesn't

1410
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,640
apply like if their speech if twitter's

1411
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,880
you know twitter supports on speech

1412
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,480
section two theories and apply it they

1413
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,160
created the content and they imbued it

1414
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,359
with whatever potentially wrongful

1415
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,839
quality but if it's somebody else's it's

1416
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,079
somebody else's and the fact that they

1417
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,559
might be accentuating it or not

1418
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,640
doesn't matter for a variety of reasons

1419
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,520
but i think the easiest way to

1420
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,200
understand it is that's not what's

1421
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,160
making it potentially wrong whoever

1422
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,480
made that speech potentially wrongful

1423
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,920
made it wrongful and the fact that it

1424
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,160
might be showing up higher or lower in

1425
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,200
the display isn't changing that that fat

1426
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,839
okay i i like that that bookshop analogy

1427
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,359
that that really

1428
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,079
explains explains it well thank you

1429
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,720
um i think that's it actually there

1430
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,520
aren't any more questions um if anyone

1431
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,040
has a quick question uh shout out now

1432
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,839
um it's 10 minutes to go and i will

1433
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,760
never talk about section 230 again this

1434
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,359
is your last chance to ever talk

1435
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,280
i mean i'm not even sure it's my last

1436
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,400
chance today so

1437
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,119
yeah i'm sure it's going to come up

1438
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,800
very much more in future it's

1439
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,359
it's one even that that me from from

1440
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,680
australia um and and when i was in south

1441
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,319
africa i was i was aware of because of

1442
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,559
of just how important it is even across

1443
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,240
the world because

1444
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,800
uh you know the world looks to the us to

1445
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,359
to define what's what how the internet

1446
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,760
works yeah i mean i would say to get

1447
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,240
back to that earlier thing face palming

1448
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,880
is a perfectly appropriate response to a

1449
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,559
lot of the stuff including the algorithm

1450
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,640
support i don't quite get it i don't

1451
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,800
think it helps i wish they would stop

1452
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,280
but i don't think there's a job for law

1453
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,960
here because of the first amendment and

1454
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,720
because section 230 is doing a really

1455
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
important job and getting rid of it is

1456
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,319
not going to make the platforms stop

1457
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,920
doing what's annoying you it's just

1458
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,280
going to make them actually do more of

1459
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,680
what you'd hate so that is the closing

1460
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,440
part

1461
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,480
okay um well thank you very much um that

1462
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,960
was very interesting uh very well

1463
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,280
explained um i really enjoyed that there

1464
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,319
were very many questions i had but yeah

1465
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,359
very explained through to me um thank

1466
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,440
you very much for your time

1467
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,000
thanks for having me
