together

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,879

for those of you just attending i i

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
to get this done

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,720
um and it's it's it's a feat of

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
amazement so

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,280
thank you everybody for joining in thank

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,959
you for dying initiative

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
um because i really want to start

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
talking about things that i

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,599
have just recently been talking more

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,280
about in our community

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
and that's mental health and self-care

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
cyber security professionals spend

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
most of their day focused on the health

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
and well-being of their environments in

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,800
their care

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,599
however this comes at the cost of

85
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,640
reducing risk of our

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
individuals i mean i'm sorry comes at

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
the cost and

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,000
not reducing the risk of our individuals

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,159
and our professionals mental health

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
a lot of people put a lot of things on

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
the line and it's taxing and it really

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
pushes people to the edge so many

93
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
information security professionals burn

94
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,640
out

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
suffer from anxiety and depression and

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,840
turn on

97
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,879
helping unhealthy coping mechanisms

98
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
um like drugs and alcohol and danny

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
and i were talking about that in the

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,040
mental health village today it's a very

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
easy thing to fall into and

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,159
um you know get out of at times

103
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,799
um so this only further exacerbates when

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,440
you do have

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
poor healthy or maybe find the wrong

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
maybe poor's out the wrong but

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
use the wrong coping mechanisms to

108
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,799
manage psychological and physical

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,319
well-being

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,080
so my goal really with a lot of these

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
talks now is to

112
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
alleviate the stigma around mental

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
health and really stress

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
the importance about frank and open

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,280
dialogues about this serious

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,239
issue impacting our community i really

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,000
want to share my journey

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
reverse engineer some of the stigma and

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,120
meant

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
around mental health and business and

121
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
look at ways that we can try to kind of

122
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
hack back at mental health and be more

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
productive and think about things in

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
more meaningful ways so

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
as we go into this i know it's been a

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
long day for a lot of folks

127
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
um i just ask that you all just kind of

128
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
focus on me

129
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,840
which i know is you know a little bit

130
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
narcissistic but

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
just try to listen to what i'm saying at

132
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
least put down the phones mute the

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,280
alerts

134
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
and really kind of let's focus and work

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
on this together so let's get started

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
and first i want to say i'm gonna there

137
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,479
there will be some trigger warnings in

138
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,080
here and

139
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,360
there will be some uncomfortable

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
subjects that i'm gonna talk about that

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,639
can act as triggers and triggers are

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,440
those

143
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
things that to put it mildly kind of

144
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
haunt us and when discussed can make you

145
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
feel like you're experiencing a past

146
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
trauma

147
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
sometimes you might not even know why

148
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,320
this is happening and i've had this

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,600
happen recently

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,520
uh on one of the tim ferriss podcast he

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
was talking about early childhood

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
early childhood trauma and it it just

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
impacted me in a way i couldn't describe

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,560
i became

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,840
shaking i i got really upset and

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,960
i it was just something about the

157
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
subject matter he was talking about uh

158
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,440
about abuse and other things that really

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
impacted me and i had this awful

160
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
reaction i had to turn it off

161
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
and just kind of step away go talk to my

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
wife about it because what the hell just

163
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
happened

164
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,360
um and these things will happen and it's

165
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
natural so if you do feel that way

166
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
if there's something i'm saying that you

167
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
find upsetting and you can't get through

168
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,120
by all means just step away there's no

169
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
harm there's no foul on that

170
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,440
do not feel like you need to tough

171
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,919

advice or delay seeking medical

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
treatment because of something you've

202
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
heard or saw in this presentation

203
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
so i've got a little bit of a legal

204
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
background so that's my legal disclaimer

205
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
but please

206
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,919
take this as information but do seek

207
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
help if you feel you need it

208
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,599
and i do want to talk a little bit about

209
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,960
some of the definitions about what we

210
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,319
hear out there

211
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
um in mental health you know when we

212
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
talk about mental health what is it

213
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
health and human services describes

214
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
mental health as

215
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,560
our emotional physical physiological and

216
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
social well-being

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,039
it affects how we think feel and act

218
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,880
it also helps determine how we handle

219
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,759
stress relate to others and make choices

220
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
and many factors contribute to mental

221
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
health problems including biological

222
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
factors

223
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
such as genetics and brain chemistry

224
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
life experiences such as

225
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
trauma or abuse and family history

226
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
self-care is any activity that we do

227
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
deliberately

228
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
something you really make an effort in

229
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,080
order to control or take care of our

230
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
mental

231
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
emotional and physical health these are

232
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,360
not passive actions per se but things

233
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,080
that we do with

234
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
intent that are self-initiated and

235
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
self-controlled

236
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
in a topic that i want to talk about and

237
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,080
again i'm on the

238
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
neurodiversity employee resource group

239
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
at splunk

240
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,879
and co-chair of the community group

241
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,560
uh community engagement group and we

242
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
look at ways that we can define what

243
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
neurodiversity is this is a rather new

244
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:05,919
term

245
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,560
we've all heard and so i've kind of put

246
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
together a definition from a variety of

247
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
sources that neurodiversity is the idea

248
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
that neurological differences like

249
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
autism adhd

250
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
mood and other functions which have

251
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
historically viewed with a negative

252
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,360
perception

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
are in fact just the result of normal

254
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
natural variations in the human genome

255
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
and so this represents a new and

256
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,120
fundamentally different way of looking

257
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,879
at conditions that were traditionally

258
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,159
pathologized

259
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
so it's a viewpoint that's not universal

260
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
universally accepted at this point

261
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,240
but it's being increasingly supported by

262
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,599
science

263
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,360
so neurodiversity advocates such as

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
myself and others point out that

265
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,560
neurodiverse people often have

266
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
exceptional abilities alongside what

267
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
society has

268
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
labeled disabilities but due to the time

269
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
constraints and there's you know really

270
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
only so much time i can talk about all

271
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,279
these subjects

272
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,560
we're going to put that aside but

273
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,399
understand that that is a underlying

274
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:58,800
theme

275
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
about how mood disorder works that it's

276
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
not something that's broken it's just

277
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,440
part of who we are so not going to

278
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
firehose you without too much of that

279
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
information about our diversity

280
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,839
but understand that there's a huge

281
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,600
overlap and

282
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
i would encourage people to do some

283
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
research on how to promote

284
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
neurodiversity in your workplace and by

285
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
all means reach out to me

286
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
um i started a i guess an international

287
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,519
coalition

288
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
of neurodiversity uh employee resource

289
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
leads so we work with other companies or

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
i do to help them build their programs

291
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
do not hesitate to reach out to me for

292
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,800
help and guidance

293
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
and for me you know my my goals going

294
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
forward i've been doing this a long time

295
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
this is even dated to say 26 plus years

296
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
it's probably closer to 30

297
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,560
years in it cyber security information

298
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,440
um governance data privacy still

299
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
obviously do a lot of work in that

300
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
and right now i really have this kind of

301
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,880
global role of helping programs

302
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
and individuals and almost say it's like

303
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,720
uh i'm like a cso therapist where i go

304
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,279
in and

305
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,360
talk to them about their program and be

306
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
a shoulder to cry on and a way to

307
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
let them verbalize what they're going

308
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
through and then we can find

309
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
constructive ways to build out their

310
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,320
programs

311
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
um but it takes it takes a lot of effort

312
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
in doing that

313
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
but really it's to me it's like i've

314
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
been talking about technology and cyber

315
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
security bulldogs for 30 years and

316
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
a lot of the problems are still the same

317
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,279
so i thought i'd tackle the easy issues

318
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:19,839
like

319
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
diversity and inclusion and equity and

320
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,959
mental health because

321
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,480
i think those are becoming easier issues

322
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
in cyber security at times so that's

323
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
really become my focus

324
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,160
on my talk tracks recently outside of

325
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
work i love snowboarding cooking

326
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
making craft cocktails uh the joke is i

327
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
moved out to the boulder area

328
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
because zombies can't climb mountains in

329
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
my overly analytical almost obsessive

330
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,079
brains that time i

331
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,600
took out a map of the united states

332
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
after so many different things that

333
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
happened which i'll talk a little bit

334
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,600
about

335
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
in new york and said okay well boulder

336
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
seems like a safe place to live

337
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
there's good schools my job carried over

338
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
here

339
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
um why wouldn't i move here and worse as

340
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
the zombie apocalypse comes

341
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,279
and gets a higher ground zombies can't

342
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
climb mountains that's a little bit of a

343
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
joke

344
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
but in all honesty i've been doing

345
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
incident response of some form

346
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,279
for as long as i can remember

347
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
when the proverbial hits the fan

348
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
i'm usually the first person somebody

349
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,680
calls

350
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,320
they look for me for guidance support i

351
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
got this plaque in 1986 when

352
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
a friend of mine we were skiing at a

353
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
local resort for

354
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,040
um you know an after school thing

355
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
and he fell and hurt himself and was in

356
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,079
terrible pain

357
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,600
we're a weird part of the mountain i

358
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
went and got first aid i got there back

359
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,640
with them i did all these things that

360
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,200
were

361
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
response and crisis management at a very

362
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,600
young age i was only

363
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,839
you know not even that was only nine and

364
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
a half at the time

365
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,600
so that's been part of my dna and it's

366
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
been really who i look at as i build

367
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
this persona at work of this idea of

368
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,720
almost being the wolf

369
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
from you know winston wolf from pulp

370
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
fiction

371
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
people call me when they have a problem

372
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,920
and i show up

373
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
i don't need a lot of context i'm here

374
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
to help you get rid of that dead body

375
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,480
and make sure nobody nobody gets in

376
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,120
trouble

377
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,160
but i really kind of go into these

378
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,040
crisis situations with a cool as a

379
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,920
cucumber persona

380
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
but i have really bad anxiety and that's

381
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
odd for people to accept at times like i

382
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
don't understand that like

383
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
you can literally walk into a burning

384
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
building um

385
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
but you have anxiety how is that even

386
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
possible

387
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
and it's weird it's a hard thing for me

388
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,560
to to comprehend at times too and it's

389
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,360
taken me a long time to come to terms

390
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
with it and i struggle with it because

391
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,519
i i don't understand it why can i

392
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,040
solve some of the world's biggest cyber

393
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,279
security problems you know i've been in

394
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,279
global newspapers i've been quoting all

395
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,800
these things i'm like my school

396
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
doesn't bother me at all where people

397
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
are like that freaks me out and i'm like

398
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,639
you know about four years ago i

399
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
accidentally bumped my backpack into

400
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
this girl on the new york city subway

401
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,519
and i'm sure she's still upset about it

402
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,040
and oh my god i'm getting all

403
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
worked up about it i mean these

404
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
free-floating anxiety issues these weird

405
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
things come into my brain

406
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,560
that debilitate me at times and i

407
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,160
obsessively worry about things

408
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,200
and they're small meaningless things

409
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
at times but to me they're the biggest

410
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
things in the world so

411
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
yeah i struggle with anxiety and it's

412
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,800
led to depression and other types of

413
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
issues that have hurt me professionally

414
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
and personally

415
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
so it's the monster in the closet i have

416
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
to deal with it's the yang to my yang

417
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,480
so while my super power is to be

418
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
even steven just cool as a cucumber

419
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
underlying that there's a lot on on

420
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
manchester on any day-to-day basis

421
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,360
which i'll talk about and i look at it

422
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
wider you know

423
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
really in our security community i mean

424
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,360
that's

425
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
a lot of people i talk to are dealing

426
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,120
with this idea that

427
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,000
hey i can't deal with my own stress i i

428
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
have to maintain this

429
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
damn near perfection in what i do in my

430
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
day-to-day life

431
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,680
and andrea lombargo said it

432
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,320
a interview a few years ago says like

433
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,639
there's never down time it's non-stop

434
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
and every day is a battle

435
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
and it's like in cyber security we need

436
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
to be right seemingly like

437
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
all the time and attackers get

438
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,000
to get

439
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
it right once or maybe a few times and

440
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
explode a series of vulnerabilities

441
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
so it's no wonder that depression

442
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,199
burnout and even

443
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,839
suicide are becoming more prevalent

444
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
among cyber security professionals

445
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
depression is still the leading cause of

446
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
disability in the world according to the

447
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,199
world

448
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
health organization after heart disease

449
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,480
so that's

450
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,040
that's pretty big but we don't talk

451
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,560
about it enough

452
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
and people with mental health conditions

453
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
have the highest risk

454
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,839
group for suicide there was a nominate

455
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,880
study in 2019 and this was just for csos

456
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,639
but draws a good example for a lot of us

457
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
in our careers

458
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
is that it was a global study of of of

459
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,279
cyber security professionals again focus

460
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
on csos

461
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,480
91 of the cso surveyed said they had

462
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,079
levels of stress that were suffering

463
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,480
that were moderate to high

464
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,959
60 percent rarely disconnected from

465
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,079
their work role

466
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
88 of csos work more than 40 hours per

467
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
week and 27

468
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,120
that work up to 60 hours 89

469
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
of us-based csos never having a two-week

470
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
break from their job

471
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,920
so most of them feel that they're

472
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
unappreciated by senior leadership

473
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,920
almost all felt like a breach was

474
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,320
inevitable however

475
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
when asked in the same organization when

476
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,680
they asked the

477
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
ceos only 60 of the ceos felt that a

478
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,639
breach was inevitable

479
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,480
but a third felt they would lose their

480
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
job or be written up formally if there

481
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
was a breach or a major incident

482
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
so there's no surprise that in the

483
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
leadership community for csos

484
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
there's a high turnover many don't stay

485
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,199
in their jobs for long

486
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,880
and so when i think about like where we

487
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
are as again

488
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,839
solving the same problems for 30 years

489
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
and where we are programmatically

490
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,480
you know in working with dc says it's no

491
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
wonder that we continue to have these

492
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,639
problems and that we haven't solved a

493
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,519
lot of the

494
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
issues because it really takes a c so a

495
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,800
good c so

496
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
18 months to two years to really start

497
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
affecting change in the job

498
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
so let's think about this you know we

499
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,040
have this slow ramp up over a year or so

500
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,639
things go well for about three to six

501
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,959
months then they burn out

502
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,000
then a new cso comes in

503
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
with the same mismanagement and

504
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
misalignment i was misalignment with

505
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
leadership and management

506
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,800
go through an 18-month cycle and they

507
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,600
leave and it becomes this vicious cycle

508
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
and it really starts with me to think

509
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,480
well then we really need a top-down

510
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
approach of managing

511
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,519
stress anxiety depression mood disorders

512
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,240
from the top

513
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,759
down you know we talk about everything

514
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,240
in information security is top down from

515
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
technical and tactical why not with the

516
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,320
people need to start with leadership and

517
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
thinking about

518
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
the way that leaders are able to cope

519
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,959
and maintain within these environments

520
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,639
so you know mental health conditions

521
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,559
come in many forms

522
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,679
but the stress that

523
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,959
folks have right now gets exhaust

524
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,319
will exacerbate a lot of these

525
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,400
underlying conditions and can

526
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,039
accelerate early onset acuity of a lot

527
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,240
of conditions

528
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,919
so stress management it becomes this

529
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,559
huge root cause for episodic symptoms

530
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,880
and these underlying diseases really

531
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
kind of rearing directly ahead

532
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
and like i said before it's causing

533
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
folks to really

534
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,760
not know where to go and what are some

535
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,400
of our

536
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
go-to coping mechanisms and we're coming

537
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,960
up on vegas in a couple weeks

538
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
and we know the problems it's alcohol

539
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
it's drugs it's strip clubs it's the

540
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,679
party scene to blow off steam

541
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
in the summer but that's not for

542
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
everybody so that further alienates

543
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,480
people

544
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,400
in our community you know jamie

545
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
tomasello's speaking of black cat in

546
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,360
2018

547
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,280
talked about the stigma she faced being

548
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,120
a recovering alcoholic

549
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
in a culture that pushes us far too hard

550
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,520
and quite frankly as a community we've

551
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
done a piss poor job of helping each

552
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
other here

553
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
and look i'm not going out for having

554
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
drinks i'm drinking actually red bull

555
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,640
right now which is

556
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,280
probably worse in many regards we're

557
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,080
having beer

558
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
tap on the office but it can't be our

559
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
only answer to

560
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
coping with this and this is why i

561
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,799
encourage things like

562
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
mental health hackers in the villages of

563
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
why we're doing something in defcon this

564
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
year

565
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,520
as a leader in the the splunk erg for

566
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
neurodiversity i'm putting down

567
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,039
our money and we're renting a room i

568
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
just signed the contract

569
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,880
at paris i'm not paris i went down sorry

570
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,039
plan hollywood to have a chill-out room

571
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,960
so people can go and decompress without

572
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
alcohol without the scene without all

573
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,679
the noise

574
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
places where they can reset and let

575
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
their neural chemicals

576
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
go back to where they should be so we

577
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
need to find more answers to coping with

578
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,440
this

579
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
because i'll admit i've done a really

580
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
bad job up until recently

581
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
um you know it's all my staff and

582
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,440
clients know i'm the first one to say

583
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,000
 it

584
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
let's just go let's go have fun but

585
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
there's got to be a better way to do it

586
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,799
because it's almost like saying well

587
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,600
screw it you know

588
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,440
the only way to manage the risk is let's

589
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,400
throw av at it good to go we walk away

590
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,039
and there's no one silver bullet to deal

591
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,240
with attackers

592
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,679
or our health so we know this is not

593
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,600
true in our computer networks but we

594
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,919
seem to avoid a multi-faceted

595
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
layer approach to maintain health in our

596
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,280
neural networks

597
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,320
so we need to change this and it's

598
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,799
getting worse right now because with

599
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,720
corona

600
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,559
it's been a hard year you know work

601
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,400
school loss of routines and schedules

602
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
that has an incredible amount of stress

603
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,000
on

604
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,559
people people have lost loved ones

605
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,679
people lost jobs

606
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,840
people just gone through a turn a lot of

607
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
trauma

608
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
and you know up until recently i mean

609
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
i've only started traveling again and

610
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
for 30 years i've been on the road

611
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,960
um and i miss seeing all of you and this

612
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
being in the room with people doing the

613
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,520
doug show

614
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
on stage in front of clients and

615
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
customers i feel completely off my game

616
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,080
i'm not looking for pity but to say that

617
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,200
you know if you're feeling this way

618
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,000
you're not alone

619
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,640
everybody's lives have been upended and

620
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
multiple times a day i'm talking to

621
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
friends and family that are really

622
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
struggling

623
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
coming out of covet i think we're gonna

624
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
have a real

625
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
strong issue of ptsd of this because

626
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,480
people don't want to have

627
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,919
look back and cope they just want to

628
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,159
jump into the next thing

629
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,280
so you know right now i feel like i

630
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
would do anything for

631
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,159
those i love and those close to me but i

632
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
feel kind of powerless right now because

633
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,240
they're still limited in what we can do

634
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
and i can't just sweep in like winston

635
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,360
wolf and just fix

636
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,480
everything and there was one article i

637
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,039
read recently that still talked about

638
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,799
corona and everything that's going on

639
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,880
and obviously there's a new delta

640
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,799
variant but it's this

641
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,039
this unrelenting horizon list of this

642
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
covert world so this

643
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,200
this idea of just it's more than just

644
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
depression it's more than just

645
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
you know burnout it's this fatigue of

646
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,120
this never-ending

647
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,919
cycle of trauma so we need to start

648
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,520
looking at new ways of how we can

649
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,799
approach this

650
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,120
because if we don't the end game is

651
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,320
could be really worse the

652
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,919
long tail effects of this are

653
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,240
devastating suicide rates have been on

654
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,679
the rise throughout the last year and

655
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
even my home state of colorado it's grim

656
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,799
it's this toxic stress that are pushing

657
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,440
people over the edge

658
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
and people feel hopeless

659
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,799
and i relate to that i i get it i don't

660
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,559
talk further about how where i felt like

661
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,440
that

662
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
so we need to think of things in more

663
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
constructive ways to support each other

664
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,559
and really acknowledge

665
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
that feeling of hopelessness and

666
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
you know one of the things that i think

667
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,679
about when i think about hopelessness

668
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,559
there's there's a

669
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
band i really love h2o from new york

670
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
near hardcore scene but

671
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,440
it's like helpless not hopeless there's

672
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
always hope

673
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,679
you got to keep that pma and you need to

674
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,840
find ways to address these issues

675
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,200
because we have to talk about this

676
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
mental health cannot be avoided as a

677
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
topic in cyber security any longer

678
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
so my pledge to this community is to

679
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,840
raise awareness and remove this stigma

680
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,440
i do not have all the answers and i

681
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,880
won't pretend to

682
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
but i will not be shy anymore to talk

683
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,919
about this issue

684
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,520
because we're hackers we can figure out

685
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,280
a better path forward together

686
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,799
you know corona side which is the

687
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,320
obvious elephant in the room

688
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
it's only exacerbated the underlying

689
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
issues we still need to do root cause

690
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,440
analysis

691
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
on the profession itself and i start

692
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
thinking how did we get here

693
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,600
and you know information security really

694
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,120
is an industry that's relatively new

695
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,840
it's this

696
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
frankenstein monster that's been brought

697
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,039
to life by i.t

698
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,360
consulting operations legal compliance

699
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,400
privacy

700
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
quite frankly we have a bit of an

701
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,120
identity crisis as we've entered our

702
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,960
teenage years

703
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
and with that i felt like we've adopted

704
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
a lot of good business practices but

705
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,480
also a lot of negative

706
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
there's so much pressure to work harder

707
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
work longer tough it out just have this

708
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
aggression aggression aggression

709
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,679
there's times i do well in it i'm a type

710
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,120
a personality

711
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,239
but it comes at a cost

712
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
in this type of mental construct of just

713
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,320
driving hard doesn't work for everybody

714
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
i've seen it change generationally and

715
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
the staff i've had over the

716
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
past five or ten years have straight up

717
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,280
said i want a better work-life balance

718
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,679
money titles glory they're less and less

719
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,720
important

720
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,000
so we need to address this as an

721
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
industry because we don't have good

722
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
answers to these needs we can't tell

723
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,840
people

724
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,200
we'll throw more money at you if you

725
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
work longer that's not the answer

726
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
so i have some ideas and i can actually

727
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,520
show how it has worked financially

728
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
they still need to be adapted and

729
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,280
peer-reviewed and tested but

730
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
i want to work on this with all of you

731
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,559
together

732
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,480
um because i think it's something we

733
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,919
need to we need to figure out

734
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,520
you know we just can't burn the candle

735
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
at both ends anymore in this industry

736
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
we have 400 000 job wrecks allegedly

737
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
if we're burning people out that's not

738
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,000
sustainable

739
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,679
so another thing i want to talk on or

740
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,200
another factor before i touch on my

741
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,480
journey

742
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,679
is um you know lives can be on the line

743
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
with cyber if you're in certain

744
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
industries and when i was in pure i.t i

745
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
can always blame a bad patch

746
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
for a down server but a breach that's

747
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,320
not a technical problem that means a

748
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,279
human

749
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
had an interaction at a certain point

750
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,880
that a breach happened

751
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
and that's heavy stuff we don't prepare

752
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
people for

753
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
and again we don't have we have this

754
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
idea we have to be right all the time or

755
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,400
else

756
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
and we need to be easier on each other

757
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,159
in on this industry

758
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
because it's not fair it's not healthy

759
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
it's not scalable

760
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,039
because most of the time lives are not

761
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,120
on the line it's a business that

762
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
maybe didn't fund the right controls or

763
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,039
see so they didn't articulate it to

764
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
the the business of what the risk

765
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,840
management is but we got to stop taking

766
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
it out on the analysts

767
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,000
in the proverbial intern when bad

768
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,880
happens

769
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
so right now i'm going to jump into

770
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,840
my journey and again just again it's a

771
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
little heads up of a trigger warning

772
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
here's if you

773
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,600
want to step back um by all means

774
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,000
i was born in 1976 new york city

775
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,600
and i was one of only children although

776
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,919
i three half sisters all very type a

777
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,799
hard driving personalities my youngest

778
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,799
sisters the broadway tour manager for

779
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,480
hamilton please do not hit me up for

780
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,960
tickets

781
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,120
i can't even get she can't even get him

782
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
um

783
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
and just i've been surrounded with these

784
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
type ages hard driving personalities

785
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,919
even as a teenager i felt i had to leave

786
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,120
my mark on the world that there would

787
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
have to be this

788
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,640
this thing i do but i didn't feel

789
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,440
comfortable

790
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,640
in high school i was beat up bullied

791
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,440
alienated

792
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,320
i was a skater punk you know that didn't

793
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,039
fit well

794
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
in upstate new york or upstate-ish new

795
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,039
york i was in the hudson valley region

796
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
but that didn't really align with that

797
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
proverbial jock mentality of you know it

798
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,679
was

799
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,120
it was almost like living in the heather

800
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
school um

801
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,080
and it i just didn't fit in i didn't

802
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,279
think the same i didn't

803
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,360
look the same i didn't approach poems

804
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,080
health teachers in in the administrators

805
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,960
were like you are bright but we don't

806
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,559
even know what to do just

807
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
just don't get in trouble because i

808
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
would find creative funny things to do

809
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
that they didn't appreciate either

810
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,679
but i really started having these these

811
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,279
feelings i couldn't really identify with

812
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,720
and

813
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
i was hanging out with my friends and

814
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,000
somebody had some weed

815
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,520
which was you know kind of crazy back in

816
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
the 90s

817
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
and i smoked some weed and had this

818
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
massive massive panic attack crippling

819
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,679
it went on for days and i i thought i

820
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,960
was gonna die i mean i

821
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
went finally told my parents what had

822
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
happened they kind of laughed it off a

823
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,919
little bit being

824
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,039
you know parents from the 70s brought me

825
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,080
to the hospital

826
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,919
doctor what's wrong with you your heart

827
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,600
rate's up but overall you're fine like

828
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,440
all your blood works fine

829
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,919
go home can't kenny can't sleep massive

830
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,960
insomnia

831
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
ongoing ongoing panic attacks go back to

832
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
the hustle back and forth finally a

833
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,440
doctor said

834
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
hey you're having a panic attack this is

835
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,480
anxiety i'm like what the hell is that

836
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,520
he's like well

837
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,039
you have um a reaction of something

838
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,080
there's something that's going on

839
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
your brain chemicals but you're having a

840
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,039
fight or flight response

841
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,360
and i'm like what the hell is that and

842
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,200
so really if you look about

843
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
just a quick medical side note so if the

844
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,320
difference between the synthetic and

845
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
parasymphatic nervous systems this

846
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
sympathetic nervous system prepares the

847
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,840
body for the fight-or-flight response

848
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,520
during a potential danger

849
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,200
on the other hand the parasympatic

850
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
nervous system inhibits the body

851
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
from overworking restoring a body to a

852
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
calm and composed state

853
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,760
the synthetic and parasympatic system

854
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,399
for me can be triggered and broken in in

855
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,919
various ways even though like i said it

856
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,039
can be under

857
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
weird stressful conditions doesn't

858
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,720
affect it other things maybe chemical

859
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
stimulants maybe

860
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
i don't know all of them you know can

861
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,039
have things i'll talk about a couple but

862
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
it can throw me off and so i didn't know

863
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,039
this and i felt oh god i'm broken

864
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,919
like i'm that's it life's over like i'm

865
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,480
you know

866
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
16 17 years old like i'm a broken human

867
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,159
being i was like no

868
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
i could get some therapy and put me on

869
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
paxil and things got better and i got

870
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,679
out of that

871
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,200
and coming out of high school i didn't

872
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
know what i wanted to do again i didn't

873
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080

890
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,919
uh some of the college investments i had

891

898
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,760
big good business clients that brought

899
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
me to other enterprise business clients

900
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,960
all of a sudden

901
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
within four years i'm serving merrill

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,080
traveling i was not taking care of

906
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,679
myself i kept going

907
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,360
and i had another bouts of anxiety and i

908
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
completely just had a nervous breakdown

909
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,240
it was burnt out

910
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
and couldn't work for weeks i had to

911
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,960
cancel a lot of projects

912
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
i hurt my business i i just didn't know

913
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,240
what to do and

914
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,840
again i went back to the doctor and

915
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
they're like like you need to fix me

916
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,240
like well

917
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,720
you have a condition it's not that

918
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,480
you're framing a little bit wrong

919
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
got on the medication again things got

920
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,640
better and things really went well for

921
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,559
for a long time um 2006

922
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,279
uh 15 years ago in a couple weeks in

923
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,480
july

924
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,080
of 19 of 2000 july 3rd of uh

925
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
2006 i met my wife and

926
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,520
things went well i'm still my businesses

927
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
now running pretty calm i'm

928
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,520
taking time for myself i'm taking care

929
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,559
of myself

930
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,960
but as this grows up and or as i grew up

931
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,320
through that process and

932
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
started to mature and have a wife and

933
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
then

934
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,960
you know a family i have a baby i was

935
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
really struggling

936
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
around 2012 with who i am and what i'm

937
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,360
doing and

938
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,480
having to leave behind some of the

939
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,000
entrepreneurial stuff and going house

940
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,279
out of company

941
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,320
and i just i wasn't right i was in the

942
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,720
right

943
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
kind of mental framing let's say for

944
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,200
that and strongly i say how do i be

945
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,640
you know working for somebody now i've

946
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,559
always been the outcome i'm a hacker i

947
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,080
don't work for people man

948
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,559
that was the outcast i i not having to

949
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,760
work for somebody to have health care

950
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,600
for a kid and all this it was

951
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
just really i was really struggling and

952
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
not doing well with this up until about

953
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
2015 and

954
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,279
16 and started another practice so i

955
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,799
kind of went more into an intramural

956
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,679
role

957
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,200
but was not communicating well i was

958
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,600
very isolated i was depressed all the

959
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,880
time

960
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
focused too heavily on work and

961
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
it was hurting my relationship with my

962
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,600
wife and even my new kid and it was just

963
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,080
i was

964
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,320
despondent i probably should have gotten

965
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,360
more help than i

966
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
did at the time i got some therapy and

967
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
counseling but wasn't really serious or

968
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,080
committed to it

969
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,600
and really felt that what i had to do

970
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,279
was get out of that environment so what

971
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,799
my wife and i started looking at again

972
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,000
we had a series of

973
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,360
wonky things that happened in new york

974
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,519
city that were noticeably stressful

975
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
like having to move twice because of

976
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,120
hurricanes you know there was

977
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,440
hurricane sandy displaced us for several

978
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,960
weeks like seven weeks

979
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
and we just got tired of that in the new

980
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
york city life and we're like okay where

981
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
do we go let's go to new york city let's

982
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,960
go to boulder and look at look at this

983
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,840
map of boulder

984
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,120
did all my risk analysis i knew at that

985
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,760
time there was going to be a potential

986
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,440
um i even said i don't know if i use the

987
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,480
word avian but i said there was going to

988
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,840
be a respiratory type

989
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,799
infection that was going to come from um

990
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,919
chinese

991
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,679
origins because of things that would

992
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,960
happen with stars i had mapped out i've

993
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,919
been doing a lot of

994
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,200
business continuity and pandemic

995
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,159
planning at the time i was like

996
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,679
something's going to hit a major city

997
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,679
let's get out of here so we're getting

998
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,720
ready to leave

999
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,840
um and we are

1000
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,039
packing up we're getting everything out

1001
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,640
of the apartment we're coming to boulder

1002
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,080
start a new life and we'll leave

1003
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,720
the be the crap behind me because just

1004
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,919
too much stress and things i haven't

1005
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,519
processed in my past so i'll just i'll

1006
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,039
just go somewhere new

1007
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,480
that will solve everything until

1008
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,440
somebody on her phone uh ran a red light

1009
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,919
texting and hit my side of the car

1010
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,559
two weeks before we are about to move we

1011
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,159
were actually out driving around

1012
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,919
to go find a breakfast place in brooklyn

1013
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,519
because they were showing the apartment

1014
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,200
and wanted us out there for renting and

1015

1017
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,840

1018
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,799

nerves were so badly compressed in my

1027
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,399

1045
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,720
to still maintain this business

1046
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,080
and i've always had a kind of rocky

1047
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
relationship with them but it was

1048
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,919
something i think when i was out of

1049
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,840
sight and out of mind

1050
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,679
they re-pivoted the way they wanted this

1051
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,519
business and

1052
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,320
about two weeks out after here use

1053
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,559
everything we could to get out here

1054
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,279
cars destroyed backs hurt they

1055
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,120
eliminated me and my entire division on

1056
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,000
the spot

1057
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
i was out of work i was out of

1058
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,200
healthcare insurance

1059
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
um their reaction was look this is just

1060
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
a financial decision what's the problem

1061
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,480

i have medical bills now that i need

1063
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
this insurance like car insurance is

1064
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,960
covering some of this but there's other

1065
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,679
things and

1066
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,919

1069
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,520

1082
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,719
so i start helping with b-sides denver

1083
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,000
reach out to some of the the

1084
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,599
groups out here in colorado start

1085
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,119
working with them but i'm not

1086
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,879
really taking care of myself i'm

1087
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,320
re-hurting my back actually getting

1088
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,159
ready for peace sites denver

1089
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,480
uh which it's certainly i'm on the board

1090
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,359
of still

1091
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,159
um and the pain just gets really bad and

1092
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,079
at that point i just collapse

1093
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,239
i i can't move on um

1094
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,480
it was it was too much and really i

1095
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,320
think the the physical pain the mental

1096
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,160
pain everything caught up

1097
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,599
in may of uh 2017 and i became

1098
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,800
just despondent couldn't get out of bed

1099
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,240
um and things got things got dark and

1100
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
it just continued to get worse and one

1101
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
of the ways that you can start raiding

1102
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,200
some of these things so you have the

1103
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,480
american institute of stress has this

1104
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,079
home's wrong stress and inventory scale

1105
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,560
so most people like you know or you want

1106
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
to stay around 150

1107
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,480
or lower so you add up all these things

1108
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,839
that happen on that left-hand column's

1109
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,800
too small to read

1110
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
you can look it up but it's things like

1111
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,240
death in the family

1112
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,200
new job moving birth of a kid like all

1113
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,240
these things and

1114
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,480
good or bad stress in your in your body

1115
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
is going to build up over time

1116
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,599
and particularly for short periods of

1117
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,000
time 300 points or more is like

1118
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
really bad like you're you don't want to

1119
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,839
be that

1120
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
when i added up everything i was over

1121
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
400.

1122
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
i mean i was literally off the chart in

1123
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,880
the levels of stress i mean i only

1124
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,320
highlighted a couple we only have so

1125
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,200
much time

1126
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,640
but so much happened in such short

1127
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
period of time of starting a new life

1128
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,960
with injury that the depression just

1129
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,400
starts setting in

1130
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,000
and emotional pain starts manifesting

1131
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,119
its ways in

1132
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,800
physical pain like there's no other way

1133
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,720
it's really hard to describe

1134
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,000
but you know once you start getting

1135
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,079
these kind of mild areas

1136
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,680
to moderate you know you really need to

1137
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,359
start

1138
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,040
getting help and seeking help and doing

1139
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
things but to me it was like i was going

1140
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,839
to tough it out

1141
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,280
i actually still tried to get help but i

1142
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,839
was really hard part of our american

1143
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,560
system of health is if you don't have

1144
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,920
job you don't have

1145
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,400
insurance so i couldn't get insurance

1146
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
help and at that point

1147
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
you know we we had to get government

1148
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,760
assistance just for things like food and

1149
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,240
stuff

1150
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,960
um which again just takes his stress i

1151
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,839
mean i went from this

1152
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,200
incredibly high paying job being able to

1153
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
pay for my family to not not be able to

1154
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,560
get my own medical insurance and it's

1155
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,880
just

1156
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,359
compounding and building on itself to

1157
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,720
the point where

1158
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,839
you know the severe scale

1159
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,960
you know when you're in that seven

1160
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,599
you're avoiding things it just got worse

1161
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,839
it got to a 10 if not more

1162
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,119
um you literally

1163
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,359
can't think it's going to get any worse

1164
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,520
and you don't you want to stop

1165
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,079
and you start thinking pretty dark

1166
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,000
thoughts you think suicidal

1167
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
and for those that have never been in

1168
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,240
that hole you know it's one thing to

1169
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,520
have

1170
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,000
bad days and really struggle but when it

1171
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,400
goes on and there's emotional

1172
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,800
trauma for a long time it starts to eat

1173
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,079
at you

1174
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,480
and there's a there's a passage by

1175
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,920
william styron that really

1176
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,280
describes it better than anything i've

1177
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
ever found and he wrote this

1178
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
memoir and depression in 1990 called

1179
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,520
darkness visible

1180
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
and there's one quote i never never read

1181
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
from slides hell i never put this much

1182
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,920
word on slides but

1183
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
i think this is profound to look at and

1184
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,160
hear at the same time because it

1185
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,480
it gives you a glimpse into what that

1186
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,079
dark closet is like

1187
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,839
and it's the great drizzle of horror

1188
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,839
induced by depression takes on the equal

1189
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,640
it takes on the quality of physical pain

1190
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,480
but it's not immediately identifiable

1191
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,880
pain like that of a broken limb

1192
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
it may be more accurate to say that

1193
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
despair

1194
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,800
owing to some evil trick played upon the

1195
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
sick brain by the

1196
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,480
inhibiting psyche comes to resemble the

1197
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,400
diabolical discomfort

1198
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,160
of being imprisoned in a fiercely

1199
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,839
overheated room

1200
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,320
because no breeze stirs his cauldron

1201
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,359
because there's no

1202
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,640
escape from the smothering confinement

1203
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,960
is entirely natural that the victim

1204
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,240
begins to think

1205
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,000
ceaselessly of obliviation or oblivion

1206
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,599
you want it to end when it's that part

1207
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,920
when all these things just crush you

1208
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,359
um it's horrible

1209
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,280
but god willing

1210
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,079
i'm an atheist but not willing i found

1211
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,000
help i finally got the therapy

1212
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,520
and the help i needed i was able to get

1213
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,640
the medication i needed

1214
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,200
i was able to get out of that hole uh

1215
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,119
love and support a family that

1216
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,280
took its toll on them to this day i mean

1217
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
it was it's

1218
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,079
not a good spot to be in and really was

1219
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,680
and i can say it now and say it seems

1220
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,119
weird to say but only three or four

1221
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:15,920
months

1222
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
but those are the longest three

1223
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
months of my life and

1224
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,640
at times i didn't want to live but i got

1225
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
out of it i found a job and i built a

1226
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,839
practice here in denver

1227
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,680
that reframed the way i thought about

1228
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,839
work so i took a lot of lessons learned

1229
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,839
about it because

1230
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,680
you know it was never easy but it was

1231
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,359
worth it um

1232
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,000
for my family for for those i eventually

1233
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,040
got to

1234
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,160
employ for more importantly for me

1235
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,400
and i need to i need i deserved it and i

1236
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
needed to understand i need to accept

1237
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,280
that i deserved

1238
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,000
to live and i deserved to love myself

1239
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
and i deserve to be loved

1240
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,480
and to continue i'm glad i did

1241
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,040
and i have an amazing life now i get to

1242
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,720
do all the things i love to do

1243
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,000
but it took it took a lot to get out of

1244
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
that hole

1245
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,920
and it took reaching out and asking for

1246
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,200
help

1247
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,680
um and look it's not it hasn't been easy

1248
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,400
i've

1249
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,319
last year there's been corona i've

1250
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,760
gotten a new job but it's been

1251
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
incredibly stressful and

1252
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,800
i sometimes don't know when to say no to

1253
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,160
things um

1254
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,680
you know when i was going to speak here

1255
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,040
in mental health i said i'll help out

1256
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,000
the mental health village

1257
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,480
because hell i'm doing it on site at

1258
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,920
wildless hackingfest def con

1259
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,680
i'll help at diane initiative and

1260
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
that would have been fine had i not

1261
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
agreed to speak at four of the

1262
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,000
conferences

1263
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
had i not agreed to teach a class at

1264
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,599
harvard while taking it

1265
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,079
had i not um agreed to take on another

1266
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,280
federal appointment

1267
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,599
had i agreed and i just i put too much

1268
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,520
on my plate lately and i'm pretty much

1269
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,119
near the walls of burnout right now and

1270
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,200
so this weekend i'm really gonna

1271
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,480
take some time to unplug but

1272
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,319
it's a constant battle i mean i i just

1273
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,680
know it's always there

1274
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
and i've come to accept that this is who

1275
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,200
i am and i love myself for it i'm okay

1276
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,839
with it

1277
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,880
i'm not perfect i don't need to be fixed

1278
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,200
but i need to know that mental illness

1279
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,400
is an illness

1280
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,920
they've got to move past the stigma and

1281
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
the shame that people feel about their

1282
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,319
illnesses

1283
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,119
and differences that's quite frankly it

1284
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,720
promotes people

1285
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
not to seek professional treatment

1286
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
forces people to self-medicate

1287
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
so we've got to remove the stigma

1288
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,839
because you know if somebody had it was

1289
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,440
diabetic you wouldn't tell them to suck

1290
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,119
it up and just smile

1291
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,400
you wouldn't call them names like hey

1292
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,240
insulin baby like we call people who are

1293
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,480
crazy so we need to stop treating each

1294
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,680
other that way

1295
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,359
and i bet many people have experiences

1296
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,280
what they just didn't feel mentally

1297
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,119
healthy for that day

1298
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,720
and then ended up using a physical

1299
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,800
ailment as an excuse to take a sick day

1300
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,160
and not going to work

1301
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,800
it's we need to go past that

1302
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,400
and people say well you know why don't

1303
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,920
you just being altruistic you know

1304
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,079
capitalism you know we need to keep

1305
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,920
going

1306
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,240
again what if i told you that in my

1307
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,280
post-traumatic

1308
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
journey when i started building a

1309
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,000
business and looking at things in a

1310
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
resilient fashion just like i would look

1311
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,480
at

1312
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,000
building a cyber security program for

1313
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,319
resilience not perfection

1314
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,160
i looked at how i could build a practice

1315
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
in a business that had resilience and i

1316
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,440
started thinking about the mental

1317
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
well-being of my staff

1318
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,040
and you know what it resulted in people

1319
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
who were happier and therefore better at

1320
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
their jobs

1321
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,720
which results in a higher employee

1322
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,079
satisfaction

1323
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,599
higher retention rates higher

1324
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,920
customer satisfaction as well it ended

1325
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,839
up with more top-line revenue

1326
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,680
and greater profit margins when i had

1327
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,280
happier healthier

1328
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,000
employees because when people feel their

1329
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,520
best they perform at their best full

1330
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,319
stop

1331
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,079
so this about mental health

1332
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,520
versus business

1333
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
is a joke there's no zero-sum game

1334
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,839
everyone can and should win and you know

1335
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,520
what are some of the just the basics

1336
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,440
that people can do right now in their

1337
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,880
workplace and

1338
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
raising or alleviating some of the

1339
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,240
stigma

1340
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,800
first talk openly about mental health

1341
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
it's not easy for me to do this like i'm

1342
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,160
this takes this toll out of me every

1343
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,000
time but it's worth it

1344
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
because ultimately i want to educate you

1345
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,200
and others

1346
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,480
so you need to get out there and educate

1347
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
others about this as well

1348
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,079
do be conscious of your language like i

1349
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,240
said i mean we use hey this must be

1350
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,640
crazy

1351
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,319
there's a lot of trigger words that we

1352
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,760
use in our environments

1353
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,480
that hurt people emotionally that have

1354
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,520
emotional trauma

1355
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,960
just as we are being more aware of

1356
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,319
things that we say that could hurt

1357
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,520
people that have

1358
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,160
um other underrepresented or that come

1359
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,920
from underrepresented groups that are

1360
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,440
now learning to adopt and change our

1361
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,160
language part of natural

1362
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,480
linguistic evolution is to change and

1363
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,160
adapt so it's not that hard to stop

1364
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
saying things that could be

1365
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,359
triggering or upsetting to people

1366
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,599
because i really want to

1367
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,359
you know fourthly encourage equality

1368
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,280
between physical mental illness i want

1369
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,800
it to be this parody where people are

1370
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,839
not like

1371
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,960
oh you know mental illness is but you

1372
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,400
know physical like oh we go to the

1373
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
doctor for that now there needs to be

1374
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,160
that open dialogue so somebody is

1375
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,000
not feeling well mentally they go out

1376
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,240
and they seek the help

1377
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,760
ultimately i want you all to show

1378
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
compassion for those with mental illness

1379
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,720
because this is not

1380
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,839
an easy journey so please be there for

1381
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,839
people and i ask i know a lot

1382
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,760
of what people try to do is comforting

1383
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
at times or saying oh don't worry doug i

1384
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,040
know i've been there too i had a really

1385
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,920
bad day

1386
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
please don't be dismissive like that um

1387
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,599
unless you were

1388
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,119
identified without you've really been in

1389
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,920
there don't identify with just listen

1390
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
listen to us who have suffered this

1391
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,440
stuff just as you would listen to

1392
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,240
somebody else

1393
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,760
in their experience and life journeys

1394
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,440
and maybe another group

1395
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,640
you wouldn't say well i know what it's

1396
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,640
like to be black as a white guy no i

1397
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,599
don't

1398
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,960
so please don't tell me you know how it

1399
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,480
is to go through what i have through

1400
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,960
unless you've been there and if you have

1401
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,520
it's okay and we'll get out of it but do

1402
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,280
allow that open dialogue for others

1403
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,000
because i really

1404
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,079
want to have empowerment over shame i

1405
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,440
want people to feel bad

1406
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,599
about these conditions understand that

1407
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,520
again these are just differences

1408
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
and we can celebrate them and be better

1409
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,200
because of them

1410
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,359
and when you do need help be honest

1411
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,839
about the treatment you know it's

1412
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,839
it's something that you need and it's

1413
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,920
okay it's okay to ask for

1414
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,200
because it's it's it's something that um

1415
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
a lot of people need but don't seek and

1416
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,160
i'm trying to encourage more people just

1417
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,800
to be

1418
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
honest about getting it and then pushing

1419
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,319
it in the workplace

1420
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,359
you know whether it's a mental health

1421
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,440
day or whatever it is just getting

1422
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,800
people out that's more of a self-care

1423
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,280
thing but

1424
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,599
you know these ideas that we need to to

1425
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,160
need time off to deal with this

1426
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,079
and do call other people's out you know

1427
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,680
you know i said this in my my

1428
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,800
diversity talk about hiring is that

1429
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,160
you know call people out when they're

1430
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,240
being stigmatizing about things silence

1431
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
equals compliance

1432
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
and i know there's going to be those

1433
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,520
folks that we say oh

1434
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,839
everyone's so sensitive these days and

1435
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,280
like no

1436
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,200
people have always been aware of what an

1437
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,800
 you are we're just finally

1438
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,000
letting you know

1439
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,880
so do not be afraid to call people out

1440
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
when they're using language that hurts

1441
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,560
others i mean it's not okay

1442
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
and just because that's the way it was

1443
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,119
doesn't mean it's the way that

1444
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,720
things should be

1445
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,200
and ultimately please do not harbor

1446
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,000
self-stigma

1447
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
it's okay not to feel okay

1448
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,119
i have some resources sir that i can dig

1449
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,319
into

1450
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,000
deeper into each one of these areas but

1451
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,599
the one thing that my therapist said to

1452
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,400
me

1453
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,760
and i'll share a little bit how i got

1454
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,599
out of my my thing and just

1455
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,760
quickly brief into to what i did to get

1456
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,640
out of these these

1457
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,400
kind of darker areas he said to me

1458
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,480
on this side pain is inevitable but

1459
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,000
suffering is optional it's a little bit

1460
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,640
flippant

1461
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,240
and i've been criticized for using this

1462
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,400
slide before

1463
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,000
but i think it's important to understand

1464
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,839
that you know you you

1465
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,400
you have to get out of that hole that

1466
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,599
the pain that you

1467
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,119
there is it's gonna happen you're gonna

1468
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,720
have pain and trauma in your life

1469
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,640
just have to make a conscious choice at

1470
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,839
times to

1471
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,680
find ways out of it so some of the

1472
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,880
things that i've done

1473
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,119
um are a variety of different things so

1474
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,800
it's been medication

1475
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,760
um that's worked i finally had to go

1476
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,960
through several different iterations of

1477
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,560
things that i found worked

1478
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,200
and keep me in a balance um you know

1479
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,359
it's just lexapro it's nothing crazy

1480
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,960
but i found it helped it was the minimal

1481
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
effective dose which helped too

1482
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,200
another thing is cognitive therapy so

1483
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,800
acceptance and commitment therapy has

1484
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
been extremely valuable to me and for my

1485
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,319
personality and my

1486
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,200
neurotype for it what acceptance of

1487
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,880
commitment therapy is or act is this

1488
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,640
action-oriented approach

1489
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,599
to psychotherapy that stems from

1490
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,240
traditional

1491
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
behavior therapy and cognitive behavior

1492
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,079
therapy so

1493
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,760
individuals in treatment learn to stop

1494
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,520
avoiding and denying and struggling with

1495
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,720
their inner emotions

1496
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,800
and instead what we do is we accept that

1497
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,559
these are deeper feelings are

1498
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,079
appropriate responses to certain

1499
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,480
situations that should not prevent

1500
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,040
me from moving forward in my life so

1501
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,160
with this understanding

1502
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,319
you know people in this modality of

1503
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,000
treatment begin to accept

1504
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,960
that issues and hardships are there and

1505
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,440
you just

1506
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,640
make committed necessary changes

1507
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,480
in your behavior regardless of what's

1508
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,920
going on in your life

1509
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,359
and choosing how you want to feel about

1510
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,559
it you know you again you're going to

1511
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,079
have these reactions it's very much

1512
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,160
centered in being in the moment saying

1513
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,040
this sucks right now i'm okay with it

1514
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,440
because i can't solve every problem

1515
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,720
and some of the things i had to do is

1516
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,400
almost existentially to help me get in

1517
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,800
those mindsets of being in the moment is

1518
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,680
reducing some of the external stress um

1519
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,760
because we're all facing with it

1520
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
and you have to set these boundaries

1521
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,160
these ways of not letting

1522
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,680
people kind of eat off your plate or

1523
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,359
your time so

1524
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,800
some of the things i've done is reducing

1525
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,960
alert fatigue i don't have

1526
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,040
and i haven't had for years i don't have

1527
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,119
work email on my phone i don't have work

1528
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,200
slack

1529
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
i don't know what i have in my phone i

1530
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,720
probably have brave browser and google

1531
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
maps i mean i use it for very little

1532
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
but i removed all the alerts all the

1533
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,880
things that are specifically designed to

1534
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,480
make you respond

1535
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,040
in a certain way i got rid of all that

1536
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,839
um

1537
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:56,960
and i make sure i have very good

1538
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,319
schedules that when i work on something

1539
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,720
i work on something no more multitasking

1540
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,359
focused periods of deep work um i've

1541
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,960
used things like the pomodoro technique

1542
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,240
to get motivated when i've had to get

1543
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,000
over just like small

1544
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,079
things to get myself motivated working

1545
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,920
on a specific task but i only work on

1546
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,839
that task at that time

1547
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,520
and a lot of this comes down to routines

1548
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,680
like for example i set morning routines

1549
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,359
and before i touch any tech or do

1550
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,440
anything i'll do some meditation

1551
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,640
some journaling just kind of ease into

1552
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,599
the day

1553
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,280
because it's it's important to really

1554
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,720
set that mindset for me

1555
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,800
personally as i enter the day and have

1556
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,960
this routine i get up at 5am

1557
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,440
i go through this every day or most days

1558
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,880
i can again i don't strive for

1559
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,680
perfection

1560
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,200
but i find it helps me kind of level set

1561
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,920
for the day as much as i can i make sure

1562
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,079
i'm hydrated as well enough i'm sleeping

1563
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:44,960
right

1564
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,240
i'm getting exercise where i can um

1565
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,760
and i take breaks from things like

1566
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,480
drinking i am starting a cocktail

1567
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,599
um bitters company and i know that that

1568
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,200
can lead to a lot of danger me

1569
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,440
excessively drinking so i have to take

1570
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,920
conscious breaks and and not drink for

1571
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,920
periods of time it's just healthy

1572
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,559
against it you know it's just i need to

1573
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,280
balance

1574
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,559
and that's what this all comes down is

1575
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,839
finding that balance in my life

1576
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,800
um because overall i just want to be

1577
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,400
more accepting of who i am and being

1578
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,559
focused more on the moment

1579
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,440
and this is who i am and this is who i

1580
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,960
am going to be and i don't have to fix

1581
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,079
everything

1582
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,040
and i really want to share the moments

1583
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,559
i'm with with the people i'm with at

1584
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,640
that moment so it's a real strong focus

1585
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,680
on me

1586
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,880
and it leads into a little bit of this

1587
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,400
ideas of self-care again the self-care

1588
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,000
is this idea is what you do deliberately

1589
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,040
for yourself

1590
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,160
to establish and maintain mental health

1591
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,280
or really any health and the idea is to

1592
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,160
prevent

1593
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,040
and be ahead of long-term illnesses kind

1594
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,720
of early down in the kill chain and we

1595
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,160
joked earlier today in the

1596
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,760
mental health village that now i've

1597
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,359
again i'm going to overextend myself and

1598
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,839
come up with a

1599
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,000
um self-care early prevention kill chain

1600
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,040
for stress

1601
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,800
so preventing burnout with kill chains

1602
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,160
it's another thing i need to put on my

1603
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,800
plate

1604
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,240
but if you think about self-care is is

1605
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,720
this it's a proactive and preventative

1606
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,240
steps just like you didn't work for

1607
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,760
vulnerability research threat hunting

1608
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,200
patching firewalls it's the stuff you

1609
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,040
kind of do for yourself

1610
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,079
because what you want to do is start

1611
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,200
balancing out some of these brain

1612
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,720
chemicals and the two main ones being

1613
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,400
serotonin and dopamine

1614
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,000
and serotonin does a variety of things

1615
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,440
in the body

1616
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,839
regulates anxiety happiness mood low

1617
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,200
levels have been attributed to

1618
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,559
depression and anxiety

1619
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,119
so they think or at least which most of

1620
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,319
the research has shown they still don't

1621
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,680
know a lot about it

1622
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,440
and dopamine is the feel-good

1623
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,680
transmitter it's the one that the brain

1624
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,559
releases

1625
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,160
when we eat food that we crave or when

1626
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,400
we have sex contributing to feelings of

1627
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,839
pleasure and satisfaction

1628
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,839
it's part of that whole reward system

1629
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,280
it's an important neurosystem

1630
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,640
neurochemical which boosts mood

1631
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,400
motivation and attention

1632
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,720
it helps regulate movement learning and

1633
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,960
emotional response and it's very easy to

1634
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,520
overdo it over stimulate yourself and

1635
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,880
your brain stops

1636
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,800
having that cycle where the healthy

1637
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,480
parts of that work

1638
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,760
and some of the things you can do for

1639
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,079
self-care is and they're simple

1640
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,400
small little things that can have a

1641
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,079
bigger impact

1642
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,040
one of the things i think is really

1643
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,119
important to celebrate the small wins

1644
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,880
um if you had a good day celebrate it

1645
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,000
you know something to be crazy you want

1646
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,839
to go balls out to the wall but

1647
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,880
maybe have a nice dinner just go do

1648
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,920
something celebratory for yourself

1649
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
when you're down don't be afraid to call

1650
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,440
a friend ask for help you know that's

1651
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,359
that's the one thing i think that

1652
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,880
more people can do is just pick up a

1653
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,119
phone and you know just slack somebody

1654
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,079
at work you know if somebody you're

1655
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,440
close would say i

1656
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,960
just need to vent or get something off

1657
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,480
my plate

1658
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,000
those little bursts of just dumping

1659
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,440
things and steadily letting them faster

1660
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,119
can be incredibly important

1661
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,760
um certainly exercising danny and i were

1662
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,800
talking about say don't

1663
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,559
you have to go crazy just simple start

1664
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,480
small maybe it's a i'm gonna walk five

1665
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,839
minutes today

1666
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
and i'm gonna walk five minutes twice a

1667
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,599
week and maybe i'll do 15 minutes twice

1668
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,960
a week whatever just start small and

1669
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,160
build up

1670
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,680
because it's going to help you get to

1671
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,839
where you want to go goal was

1672
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,599
one of the things too is obviously when

1673
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,640
we talk about corona and everything

1674
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,319
that's happened over the last year is

1675
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,319
stop doom scrolling like get off social

1676
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,760
media um

1677
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,599
as good as things like twitter can be

1678
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,880
for our community i've seen it go

1679
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,640
extremely toxic and you all know what

1680
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,760
i'm talking about

1681
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,319
um it has an emotional response so get

1682
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,839
away from that stuff as much as you can

1683
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,000
and stop reading the news obsessively

1684
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,599
um particularly with the last year this

1685
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,880
has been stressful there's a lot of

1686
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,240
things you can't change with that

1687
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,520
be aware don't be consumed

1688
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,960
again i talked about these routines like

1689
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,640
getting into these routines of sleep

1690
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,079
exercise meditation that can be

1691
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,680
incredibly helpful

1692
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,200
and the one thing i stress with all of

1693
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,880
this is that done is better than perfect

1694
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,400
like you don't have to

1695
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,079
every day have this and i did that and i

1696
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,680
did it wrong for a long care time for

1697
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,800
self-care it's just

1698
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,319
it has to be this rigid thing that

1699
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,839
doesn't you know you want to just have

1700
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:44,480
these

1701
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,680
these slow kind of builds of things and

1702
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,000
if you do it 80 of the time that's great

1703
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,800
um

1704
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,240
because that's gonna be really important

1705
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,760
because you can really it up too

1706
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,240
you can also do fake self-care and i've

1707
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,440
seen this as like i said it's a drive

1708
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,920
for me it's like i overdo it and it's

1709
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,400
you know it's i've done just about all

1710
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,839
these antics on the list of fake

1711
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:04,640
self-care

1712
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,520
you know most notably dieting drinking

1713
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,160
harmfully

1714
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,680
talking down to myself to motivate

1715
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,599
myself just a bunch of bs or

1716
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,040
oh i'm gonna miss out on something this

1717
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,800
fomo thing so instead of saying

1718
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,240
time with my family being in the moment

1719
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,000
like i talked about rushing out and

1720
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,359
being away from things

1721
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,680
so it's very easy to fool yourself and

1722
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,880
do things that

1723
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,880
are unhealthy in the name of health

1724
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,240
but you deserve it you know there's

1725
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,920
these myths about self-care and i really

1726
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,599
want to get rid of that stigma

1727
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,880
that is selfish or you know it's

1728
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,040
like this big ask in your life it's not

1729
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,319
you deserve it

1730
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,000
again when you feel better you'll treat

1731
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,760
others better

1732
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,680
and just get these little routines of

1733
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,839
doing it you know this idea that you do

1734
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,680
something for 21 days you get into good

1735
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,400
habits

1736
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,640
let's try for 21 days just try good

1737
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,960
healthy things that i put on that slide

1738
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,799
little routines that you can add on for

1739
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,319
21 days you'll find that you'll build

1740
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,680
some momentum you'll start feeling

1741
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,839
better and guarantee it

1742
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,319
but it needs to be an ongoing practice

1743
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,440
so please that's the one thing i

1744
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,960
encourage you is starting with some

1745
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,559
self-care because you just you deserve

1746
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:06,799
it

1747
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,200
we love you we think you you need it you

1748
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,480
need it love yourself and start there

1749
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,440
and i just want to leave you all with

1750
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,200
some parting thoughts you know it's

1751
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,720
again this is obviously some

1752
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,559
heavier subjects and we've gotten some

1753
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,839
deeper stuff but

1754
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,760
i really love this quote from robin

1755
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,240
williams um

1756
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,480
because ultimately the one thing that i

1757
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,400
try to

1758
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,760
learn from in my past miss i don't even

1759
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,000
use the words mistakes that's not right

1760
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,799
my journey is not only to

1761
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,920
be more aware how i am to myself but how

1762
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,440
i am to others

1763
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,280
so first you know obviously forgive

1764
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,880
yourself be kind to yourself

1765
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,160
be vulnerable and we spend so much time

1766
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,880
addressing vulnerabilities in our

1767
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,799
networks but how much time we time

1768
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,079
looking at the vulnerabilities that we

1769
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,319
feel in ourselves and we improve our

1770
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,520
cyber programs

1771
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,160
do the same with yourself accept them

1772
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,760
focus on what you can improve in your

1773
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,319
own well-being and be resilient

1774
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,880
but be nice to others um because

1775
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,839
honestly

1776
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,960
you can't control other people in most

1777
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,400
situations

1778
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,079
you can really only choose how you

1779
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,040
respond how you choose to respond to

1780
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,119
other people

1781
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,680
warren buffett was uh giving this tv

1782
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,520
interview one time and he says

1783
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,839
this gentleman by the name of thomas

1784
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,599
murphy

1785
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,480
and um so i'm sorry so the best piece of

1786
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,559
advice that warren buffer got was an

1787
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,559
issue he was talking about this by his

1788
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,079
friend thomas murphy and thomas murphy

1789
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,119
said to him

1790
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,640
warren you can always tell someone to go

1791
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,799
to hell tomorrow

1792
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,400
meaning that it was kind of this easy

1793
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,079
way of putting it you don't have this

1794
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,520
missed opportunity to tell somebody to

1795
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,720
go off

1796
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,200
just forget about it for a day if you

1797
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,559
feel the same way tomorrow

1798
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,040
tell them but don't spout things off in

1799
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,760
the moment of

1800
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,520
anger like again we call a lot of what

1801
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,359
we do incident response not incident

1802
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,400
reaction

1803
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,599
don't react to everything slow your role

1804
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,520
we do not have to react to everything in

1805
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,799
our environment because like i said in

1806
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:09,520
most

1807
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,839
situations you can only control how you

1808
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:12,799
react

1809
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,000
so respond be in the moment but as my

1810
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,040
friend dalton said

1811
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,079
at the double deuce be nice don't let

1812
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,599
everything get under your skin

1813
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,960
it's a simple little reframing of things

1814
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,960
of how you choose to respond to life

1815
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,160
stresses that's gonna

1816
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,920
start you on this journey because

1817
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,480
really you need to make time for your

1818
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,720
wellness or i guarantee

1819
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,920
you'll be forced to make time for your

1820
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,680
illness

1821
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,200
encourage everybody do one little

1822
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,760
takeaway task

1823
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,880
tonight before you go to bed

1824
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,839
put down by your bed i'm sure

1825
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,720
everybody's got a pad or something they

1826
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,839
can write on

1827
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,559
and when you wake up tomorrow write down

1828
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,480
five good things about yourself

1829
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,000
first thing when you wake up maybe do

1830
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,359
your meditation before you touch any

1831
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,640
tech you know as part of your morning

1832
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,720
routine

1833
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,240
write down five good things about

1834
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,400
yourself and i bet that's gonna be a lot

1835
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,760
harder than you think

1836
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,520
and it's a tough thing and the reason i

1837
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,960
want people to do that is

1838
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,040
to really sit and focus and think about

1839
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,480
the good things that you bring to the

1840
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,720
table into the world because you do

1841
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,960
but you need to consciously do that

1842
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,160
because we all get this

1843
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,000
negative habits of putting ourselves

1844
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,920
down and saying we didn't do enough

1845
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,400
but start your day right by maybe just

1846
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,839
writing down a couple good things about

1847
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:32,880
yourself

1848
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,319
you'll be surprised how that reframes a

1849
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,720
lot of what you do because

1850
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,680
you're worth it you know we love you we

1851
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,720
need you

1852
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,200
community needs you so support each

1853
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,240
other

1854
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,960

1855
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,960

1856
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,040

1857
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,720
enjoyable and we all learned

1858
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,160

1859
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,680

1860
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,480
minutes left

1861
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,040

1862
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,680
questions

1863

1865
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,119
from the audience

1866
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,960

1867
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,799
