academy that creates software that just this
week announced working with the application

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,160
security project to provide free access to
the level one course on We Hack Purple for

00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,810
also in the talk, and BridgeCrew by Prisma
Cloud. Today we are having Tanya Janca talking

10
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:18,090
Building Security Champions. How do you select
chances or how to make best use of them you're

11
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,200
in the right place? This will help you attract
people to your program, how to engage them

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,090
and turn them into security advocates, what
to delegate or not delegate, what to communicate

13
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,570
and how to create an amazing security champion
prom. Without further ado, here is Tanya Janca.

14
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,689
TANYA: Hi, everyone. I'm Tanya. I'm going
to assume that you can see my slides. If you

15
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:49,258
can't, you'll tell me. Because the way PowerPoint
works, it covers up the way we're streaming.

16
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,729
I want to talk about building security champions.
The reason we build security champions is

17
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,850
because we want to scale our programs. And
thank you, Maggie, for introducing me. I forgot

18
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,860
to say thank you.
So, basically, we're going to talk about scaling

19
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,090
your security team and scaling your program.
Because there are just like there's just not

20
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,180
enough people. There's just not enough people
to do all of the jobs. Like who here has enough

21
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,110
money and enough people and enough tools to
do all the things they wish they could? There's

22
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,970
not gonna be any hands that go up. Because
security teams are vastly outnumbered. GitHub

23
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:35,819
actually GitHub just released a paper I think
last month about how security people are outnumbered

24
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:42,399
500 software developers to one. 500!
So, we can't just work harder, we have to

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,269
work smarter. And we want to scale that mean
like be able to do way more things, but with

26
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,090
the same resources and that's what we're gonna
talk about. We're also gonna talk about what

27
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,239
the heck are security champions? What is Tanya
even talking about? And how we can build them

28
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,240
up.
So, sometimes I have seen places where they're

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,011
like, you were late to the meeting, you have
to be the security champion. Guess what? That

30
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:10,670
champion's probably not going to be very good.
So, we want to talk about better ways to do

31
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,559
things. So, we're going to talk about our
recipe. So, we're gonna follow this recipe

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,299
and break this down one by one throughout
the talk. I'm going to repeat it and come

33
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,989
back to. And you're going to be totally sick
of the recipe at the end. The first thing

34
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,549
we're going to do wrong button. Wrong button.
Okay.

35
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,770
First thing we're going to do is we're gonna
recruit. Engage them. We're gonna teach them,

36
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,150
talk about what to teach them and how. We're
gonna recognize them amongst their peers,

37
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,650
amongst management. And then we're gonna reward
them for their awesome work. And lastly, we're

38
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,459
gonna keep on doing it. We don't stop. We
don't want your operation to languish and

39
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,730
disappear and evaporated. That happens easier.
Maggie did a better job of introducing me

40
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:03,660
than that slide. But the idea of the about
me slide is to try to show you that we're

41
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,420
qualified to give our own talk. I'm going
to assume, yeah, she seems fine. I'm willing

42
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:15,140
to sit through this. Awesome. So, the problem.
Whenever anyone gives a talk, you have to

43
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,560
introduce the problem. And some of you probably
super acutely feel this problem. And some

44
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,419
of you are probably maybe like less aware
of the problem. Depending on what job you

45
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,750
have and if you're in management. So, like
the previous so, I don't know if you saw the

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,589
previous presentation on this. I was watching
and they were great. And they were all leaders.

47
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:45,260
So, all of those amazing women like Ann Johnson,
I'm gonna say InfoSec, I follow her online,

48
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,599
Tracy, all of them have led lots of teams
and people. They're well aware that there

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,960
are not enough applications for people to
go around. We have tons and tons of software

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,630
developers constantly just doing amazing things
all day. Like building things, creating things,

51
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:10,440
designing, architecting. Debugging, fixing,
repairing. Et cetera. Tons of stuff. And then

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,750
you have, you know, one security person for
all 500 of them.

53
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,789
Also, hiring a security person is really,
really hard. Hiring them and keeping them

54
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:27,000
is hard. All of those people in the previous
panel can definitely tell you that first of

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
all the marketplace right now demands tons
and tons of money for an app sec professional.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,400
They pay very well. But it's hard to attract
them and get them to work with you. Especially

57
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,969
if you have legacy applications. Which lots
of us do. Lots of everyone, I want to work

58
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:52,450
on the cool, cutting edge new thing. And so,
if you have older systems, those probably

59
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,520
have more security problems and it's even
harder to attract awesome security people

60
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,099
to your team.
So, to fix this problem, one way that I am

61
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,320
suggesting so, there's a bunch of ways that
you can work on this problem but the way I'm

62
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:11,120
going to dive into in this presentation is
specifically building a security champions

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,470
program where you train up lots of people
that aren't on the security team to do some

64
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:21,709
of the security jobs for you.
And they still do their jobs full time. But

65
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:26,550
on top of their job, they do a bunch of extra
things that magically make your job and life

66
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,220
way better. So, let's talk about scaling your
team and your program.

67
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,420
So, we know there's not enough people. So,
we have to scale. Right? And I thought, like,

68
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,909
working out and lifting weights was a good
a good the thing about security champions,

69
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:50,849
actually, let me tell you what they are first.
So, I'm gonna read a super professional, formal

70
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,159
sounding definition. Then I'm going to give
you Tanya's definition. That's how I am. A

71
00:06:55,159 --> 00:07:00,310
security champion and a member of a team that
takes on the responsibility of acting as the

72
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,050
primary advocate for security within that
team and acting as the first line of defense

73
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,161
for security issues within that team. Meh.
So, instead, plainly, it is the person that

74
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:15,899
is most excited about security. It's the person
that reads the book, that fixing the bug.

75
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:22,630
That asks all the questions every time. That's
your champion. And so, like what is what do

76
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,080
they do? What if people are like a security
champion, that's a nice word, what does it

77
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,680
mean? So, this person is your communicator.
They deliver security messages to each Dev

78
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,630
team. They teach, they share knowledge, and
they help. This person is your point of contact.

79
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,159
So, they are your representative on the team.
They deliver messages about security. Like

80
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,360
they deliver messages back to the security
team. They keep you up to date on what matters

81
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,789
from a security perspective. So, that you
are ready. And they are your advocate. So,

82
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,750
they perform security work for their Dev team.
And they help like they use help from your

83
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,149
team. But they also advocate for security.
So, they are that person that's in the meeting

84
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,480
that like you can't make every meeting that's
happening across your entire organization.

85
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,110
So, they are your voice. They are the person
saying, you know what? I don't know about

86
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,070
this from a security perspective. Like, I
think we need to invite a security person

87
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,959
to this meeting. Or I learned about threat
modeling and I'm seeing this threat and I

88
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,120
want to tell you about it.
So, a security champion does a lot of stuff

89
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:35,370
that's, in my opinion, very, very valuable.
So, let's talk about building security champions.

90
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,029
Because so, they're talking in the last session
about like are leaders built or are they born?

91
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,650
Well, security champions are definitely built.
No one comes out of the womb and they're like,

92
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,030
I already know application security. That's
not a thing. Just the same as no one can come

93
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,760
out of the womb and be like, I know how to
code. But that's okay. Because we can build

94
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,140
up someone to be able to do this. Especially
if they're interested. So, again, this is

95
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,860
the recipe. And we're gonna go just through
this over and over again. So, we want to find

96
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,940
people that are interested and then build
them up. Build up their skills, build up their

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,510
confidence, their engagement, their interest.
And then and then keep doing it. And they

98
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,700
will just magically you know like how bees
just go around like gardens, and they just

99
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,370
magically pollinate everything? But you can
help the bees by planting like certain flowers

100
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,260
or certain things that make bees show up and
do their awesome bee magic. It's kind of like

101
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,920
that. I guard an lot. Okay.
So, back to the recipe. We're gonna start

102
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,469
out recruiting your champions. So, we want
to talk about recruiting people. And so, the

103
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:49,540
number one rule in recruiting is, please don't
voluntell someone to be a security champion.

104
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,819
So, like you're late to the meeting. Or you're
our weakest Dev. Or we want to punish this

105
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,491
person. Or or we just give it to the senior
tech who is super, super busy. Who feels that

106
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:07,800
this is just another responsibility day don't
have time for? That's not gonna work very

107
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,890
well. We're not gonna get the results we want.
Whenever possible, you want to attract the

108
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,830
right people instead. So, I have a number
two rule in recruiting and then we're going

109
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,430
to talk about how to recruit them. So, number
two is managers have to be on board.

110
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,189
So, if managers are like, you're wasting my
team's time. They're not gonna give them time

111
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,900
to do the work. And that's going to be conflict.
And you want your manager to be happy. So,

112
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,689
you need approval from top down. I have done
it without approval from top down. And like,

113
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,430
slowly it just went a lot slower and some
teams I couldn't get a champion. And when

114
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,520
I had eventually got approval from the top
down, it was like off to the races. Life is

115
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,380
a lot better. You definitely want managers
to be on board. And the people aren't secretly

116
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,180
doing the work without their manager's knowledge.
It's much better that it's all legit and aboveboard.

117
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,229
Okay. So, let's recruit some people. Like
I said, we want to ask for volunteers instead

118
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:16,180
of appointing people without consent. Consent
is really important in all parts of life.

119
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,400
We want to provide opportunities for them
to reveal themselves. And so, this might sound

120
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,340
weird. So, some people, they don't know they
want to be a security champion. Like, and

121
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,970
some people it turns out, you can strike this
passion within them that they didn't know

122
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,990
they had. And spark this interest. And so,
ways you can do this, it sounds so silly.

123
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,790
But one of my clients, they just changed their
email signature to say that they were looking

124
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,839
for security champions. They're like, I'm
looking for security champions. Is this you?

125
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,110
Ask me how. And they found two champions that
way.

126
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,380
And so, I have been advising lots of other
people to do it. It's very interesting results.

127
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,680
People reply to your email, ask questions.
Other ways we can attract volunteers are having

128
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,640
lunch and learns or trainings. Anyone that
asks questions or attends almost all the events,

129
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,180
that person is an awesome potential champion.
We want to use interesting titles for anything

130
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,660
we can to attract more people. I remember
the first presentation I ever did at work,

131
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,790
I emailed everyone, and I said, I'm gonna
break into a bank at lunch. Who wants to watch?

132
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,680
And a bunch of people are like, what? And
then I I showed them a vulnerable web app

133
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,130
that was a banking web app. And I explained
it wasn't a real bank. And then I showed them

134
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,590
how I got in. And then with that information,
showed them how we could protect our apps.

135
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:45,050
And it just got a lot of people kind of curious.
And then I got more people at the next presentation.

136
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:54,449
So, and another thing, having my mantra, it's
my job to serve you. Devs are the customers.

137
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:00,140
The security team, it's our job to serve you.
When you kind of flip it on its head like

138
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,850
that. A lot of security teams are like, you
have to do what I say.

139
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,080
That doesn't first of all, like we're all
adults. And we're like, I don't want to be

140
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,980
told what to do. I don't someone to just boss
me around. Instead if question say, listen,

141
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:22,420
it's my job to help you do your job securely.
I serve your team. I serve all of the Dev

142
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,990
teams and I do this by giving you tools, I
do this by writing documents, I do this by

143
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,300
answering questions and giving the best advice
I possibly can by researching things for you.

144
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,750
And when you change that wording and your
mantra and the way that you talk to Devs,

145
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,730
that will help you recruit a lot.
So, now that we have some people that are

146
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,190
interested, we're gonna start engaging them.
And just so you know, when you start engaging

147
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,570
people, that's gonna help you recruit more
people. It's kind of awesome. It's like a

148
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,350
circular sort of thing where you just keep
feeding and finding more people, the more

149
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,560
awesome your program is. So, let's engage
some people. So, the word "engage" can mean

150
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,029
to occupy, to attract or involve. We want
to do that with the Devs for our, like, around

151
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,470
security activities. But we also want to do
it the other way. So, we want to participate

152
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,500
or become involved with what they are doing.
So, if they're doing a project, you know,

153
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,740
we want to say, like, do you need help with
that? Like can I come and do a threat model

154
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,770
on your architecture design? Or, you know,
do you can I scan your code? You want to be

155
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:37,680
involved with what they're doing as well.
So, to engage. I have I cut this to only two

156
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,120
slides because I'll just be like, ah... all
day. And there are other presentations. So,

157
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,839
one thing you can do is bring them on a software
related security incident. Assuming that you

158
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,930
don't work in a top secret government environment
or something like that, you can probably bring

159
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,029
them on an accident that has to do with software.
Especially if it's their software. And show

160
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,710
them the fire that you are fighting. I went
on a security incident. And after that I became

161
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,610
an incident responder and was totally obsessed
with IR.

162
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,990
Share appropriate secrets. I once, with my
boss, this was my boss' idea and I was dead

163
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,660
set against it. He was like, we have to do
this. He was right. I was wrong. And we brought

164
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,880
a bunch of Devs in. We had this one Dev team.
They didn't want to do anything with security.

165
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,040
They were like, you're wasting our time. We
got to deputize them. Raise your right hand

166
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,180
and not tell anybody outside of the room.
We explained the concept of need to know and

167
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,910
about a huge, awful security incident to do
with one of their apps. And another security

168
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:52,870
incident that was leaking employee data by
accident. Not leaking it. We had some malware,

169
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,980
and it might have and we told them and how
it affected the employees in their personal

170
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,981
lives. Well, not specifics. But generalization.
And so, from that day on, they were they were

171
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:12,840
our warriors, they were amazing. They were
leading the charge. They were so awesome.

172
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,600
We want to let all your champions see everything
first. If there's a policy, if there's a new

173
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,740
tool, if there's changes or information or
anything that you're planning, always tell

174
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,410
them first. It makes them feel engaged and
special because they are special. Create a

175
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,480
mailing list to tell them about new security
stuff. Or if you listen to a podcast and it's

176
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,940
actually really, really good and you're like,
oh, this is like a security podcast, but it's

177
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,690
totally about Node.js and there's these three
teams doing that, send them an email, tell

178
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,190
them about it. All those things make them
feel engaged and they matter to you. And it's

179
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:53,350
really important they feel like they matter
to you. Because otherwise you will lose them.

180
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,190
I want to meet with them once a month and
have like a list of questions. So, like, what

181
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,770
are you working on? What are you planning
on working on? Do you need any help? You want

182
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,240
to brace yourself for bad news and play it
cool. So, I have had people tell me about

183
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,010
security things. And then I freak out. And
that does not give me the results that I want.

184
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:20,459
And so, I've learned to remain calm. And when,
you know, a Dev says, if we encode something

185
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:27,660
twice with Base64, is that the same as encryption
or is that kind of different? Be cool. And

186
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:35,470
it will go better. Be cool and calm.
So, team building events. And letting your

187
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,420
security champions know each other. That's
super cool. A lot of them really appreciate

188
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,750
the chance to talk to each other so they can
talk about security things with each other.

189
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,460
Yes! Win! And I like to always invite them
to join local security communities. So, I

190
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,430
used to live in Ottawa, and we had an amazing
huge vibrant chapter. I would invite them,

191
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:06,020
we're having a CTF next week. Do you want
to come? We lived walking distance from where

192
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,090
the meetings would be. A group of us would
actually walk together and that was awesome.

193
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,720
Whatever you can do to make them feel engaged.
So, now teaching. What are we gonna teach

194
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,250
our champions? There is a lot to teach them.
Okay. So, I feel it's very important to only

195
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,300
teach them what they need to know and not
teach them more. Oh, my gosh. So many companies

196
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,050
that I can consult with, they're like, oh,
well we're gonna give them these advanced

197
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:42,050
network penetration testing course. Oh, yeah.
Why? Do they write advanced network security

198
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:47,620
tools? No, they just write web apps. Why are
you teaching them that? That is a bunch of

199
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,840
crap they don't need to know, and they'll
never, ever practice it as part of that are

200
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,280
jobs. Which means they'll lose the skills
almost immediately. Well, it's cool. Did you

201
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,500
think it's cool? They're Devs. They might
think Dev stuff is cool and not hacking stuff.

202
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,210
I'm not saying none of them will think that's
awesome. Some places they like to. But I feel

203
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,360
that it's really important that if you are
going to teach them stuff, teach them what

204
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,550
they need to know. Software developers have
to know a bunch of different programming languages,

205
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,530
frameworks, one or more database, they have
to know servers, deployment, all this stuff.

206
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,401
There's so much stuff they have to know, don't
fill their brains with extra stuff. So, what

207
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:36,679
you need from them, what you expect from them
and what you want from them as champions is

208
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,559
the core to what you need to teach them.
So, anything they need to know in order to

209
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,370
do the things you want them to do you got
to teach it to them. So, I'm gonna give you

210
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,159
three topics. And then we're gonna drill down
on each of those topics of things I think

211
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,560
you should teach champions. So, secure coding
and secure architecture. Your policies that

212
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,240
affect them. So, not like general things like,
you know, don't bring your home laptop to

213
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,160
work and plug it into our network. But things
that specifically involve the Devs. And tooling.

214
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,810
So, any tool use expect them to know or see
the results of, you want to teach them.

215
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,550
So, for secure coding and architecture. So,
you can give them formal training on secure

216
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:21,370
coding with labs. You want them to have some
hands on action there. You want them to teach

217
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,600
them threat modeling. And eventually, you
want them to be able to do threat modeling

218
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,120
themselves. Every time you do a threat model,
you want to have one of your champions there

219
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,479
if at all possible. Security architecture.
So, like whiteboarding out what the architecture

220
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,530
looks like for the system. Asking questions.
Invite them every time that you can. Code

221
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,510
review. So, you want them to be able to review
their you want them to be able to review their

222
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:53,580
peer's code for a potential problem. So, maybe
they're the person that approves pull requests.

223
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,139
Or maybe they just approve some of them. But
if you have at least one person on the team

224
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,500
being able to spot security problems, that
is A plus awesome.

225
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,420
How to fix security bugs that they find. Or
that you send them. So, anything you can do

226
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,840
to teach them the common bugs and what to
do, that's awesome. And I suggest repeating

227
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,280
at least secure coding every single year.
Things change. People forget. Just it's a

228
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,480
lot of information. And so, every year and
if you happen to be a company that handles

229
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,960
credit card information, you actually, to
be PCI compliant, have to repeat secure coding

230
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,540
every year. I realize that's one of the things
that I teach. But as someone what was a Dev

231
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,740
17 years before she worked in security, trust
me. Refreshers are good.

232
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,910
Okay. So, your policies. So, you want them
to know which policy standards or guidelines

233
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,580
apply to them and you want them to know them.
Because they're gonna talk to other people

234
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,770
on their team. And you want them to be able
to answer questions. And it's like, well,

235
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:04,280
do I really have to use parameterized queries?
Yeah. You do. And so, if you have them saying

236
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,470
that, then you won't have to repeat it 400
times a day like I do.

237
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,460
You want to help them create missing guidelines.
So, let's say you work at a company and they're

238
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,660
just starting to do serverless. So, one of
my clients they consult for, they have like

239
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,570
one or two serverless apps. Awesome! So, we
wrote a best practicing document for serverless

240
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,030
to share with the Devs to try to help. We
would really like to see this, we would like

241
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:35,330
to see that. Please, please let us come to
a meeting with you for architecture review.

242
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,330
Let us do this, let us do that. And so, helping
them create any guidelines that are missing.

243
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,689
So, like, first of all, secure coding guidelines.
Secure design concepts that you want them

244
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:51,480
to implement. API best practices, et cetera.
So, like, we expect if you're using APIs that

245
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,290
if they're external facing, they will only
be available via an API Gateway. This is the

246
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:05,971
API Gateway we use. This is what we want.
That's less mistakes to clean up later. Teach

247
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:14,550
them how to be compliant with your policies.
Give them a workshop and give them hands on

248
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,559
things. I've had a lot of people say, well,
you're a professional trainer. So, you're

249
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,170
good at making training. But I sucked. I was
awful when I started. It took a long time

250
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,470
to get good at it. But the Devs still came
and learned. You don't have to be an amazing

251
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:38,840
presenter. Just try your best and be honest
and open with them. And always be open to

252
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,629
questions. And if you don't know the answer,
just say: I don't know. But I will get back

253
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,930
you on that. And write it down and get back
to them.

254
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,600
And like just those things. People will be
engaged. Like people want to learn. Devs want

255
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,178
to make awesome software and awesome software
is secure software. So, like, they trust me

256
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:05,950
you don't have to be a great presenter. I
was really crappy presenter. So, you want

257
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,840
them to know what their role is during a security
incident. This is super important. I want

258
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,939
all the Devs to know. But if you can't get
time with all the Devs, just telling the security

259
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,080
champions, like, listen, if there's a security
incident going on with your app, please don't

260
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,080
just go home for the day and not tell us partway
through. Or like bring up pager because apparently

261
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,600
it's 1990. But get their cell phone number
or something in case you need information

262
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,770
from them, et cetera. Don't run around and
tell all your Dev friends, et cetera. What

263
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,100
is need to know. I'm a big fan of letting
them job shadow them on things they're interested

264
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,560
in. I ask what they want to learn for their
jobs, and I let them shadow me.

265
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:53,169
Yeah, I'm going to be using this static application
security testing tool all day reviewing code

266
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:58,150
in this really ancient legacy app and it's
going to be a dumpster fire. Do you want to

267
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,260
sit with me for four hours? I'm just going
to validate results, so they know how to validate

268
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:10,169
their own results. Sure, let's have a job
shadow session. And hold consultations. To

269
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:15,300
help them to let them provide input on policies
that will affect them. First of all, you want

270
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,200
their super awesome ideas and feedback. Second
of all, you want to make them feel valued

271
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,350
and heard. So, it's always awesome to hold
consultations.

272
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:31,350
So, next, tooling. So, custom training on
tools that you expect them to use. What does

273
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:36,168
the output mean? How can you validate the
results of those tools? Thousand install and

274
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:42,169
configure those tools? Help them select the
best tools. If you want to be part of the

275
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:49,460
concept, be involved. Lunch and learns or
hackathons. You want them to be the expert

276
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,669
on their team about the security tools. So,
coaching, a style of teaching. So, I believe

277
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:01,040
this kitty is a Jedi and people just don't
know. And so, I believe that when people coach

278
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,059
or mentor other people, that they're truly
in a class of their own. Giving knowledge.

279
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:12,860
I have a lot of respect for really senior
people that just like share that knowledge

280
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:20,299
down to make sure that they will have a successor.
I really I have been the beneficiary of that

281
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,620
many times in my career. And so, I I personally
think like mentoring and coaching is extremely

282
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,159
important.
So, coaching means enabling individuals and

283
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,750
teams to reach their full potential. Okay.
So, we want to facilitate them like their

284
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,610
needs, their motivations, skills and processes.
But basically, we want them to make real lasting

285
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,809
change. And in this case, we want to put the
security bug in their brain so that they can't

286
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:51,470
stop seeing security things. This is what
happened with me and then look at me now.

287
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:57,809
Now I do security full time. If we want teams
to start practicing a secure system development

288
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:02,240
life cycle, you need to support them in getting
there and that is coaching. And if we want

289
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,559
our security champions to constantly reinforce
the security team's values and evangelize,

290
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,550
we have to coach them and be there for them.
And so, how can we coach? So, besides being

291
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:21,120
a kitty and then giving it a light saber,
for champions so, we can set up office hours.

292
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,030
So, every Friday, 2 to 4 I have a Zoom meeting
open. Or if you're in person, you're like,

293
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,590
I'm gonna be in my office. I'm not going of
it meetings. Chat me up. I would love to hear

294
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,790
what you have to ask. Set repeat meetings
with your champion. Once per month with your

295
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,678
champion. Check in with them, ask them what
are you working on? What are you planning

296
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,730
on working on? Do you need any help? Help
them prioritize security activities or bugs.

297
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:53,090
Be available to them whenever you can.
Help them set goals and then help them achieve

298
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:59,820
those goals. And it might be a learning goal,
a bug fixing goal. It might be my team manages

299
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,970
eight apps and I want this tool in all eight
pipelines so I can, you know, master this

300
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,200
one part of security. Teach them specific
skills or tools that they're interested in.

301
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,380
And ask them what they need and then provide
it. When you do that, you build trust. And

302
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,000
that's what you want. And that's what you
need. Because a security person's eyes can't

303
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,720
be everywhere. And our tools can't pick everything
up. And having a Dev that believes in security,

304
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:36,000
that understands its importance and really
takes that to heart in every meeting it's

305
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,549
amazing! That person will say, oh. What about
if this happens? Or, hey, I heard that this

306
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,820
framework's more secure than that framework.
What about this one?

307
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,669
Like, just it's magic, them asking a question
or making a comment. And that Dev is their

308
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,770
pierce. It's not an external person. Like
from the security team coming over and being

309
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,679
like, ah, security dogma. It's one of their
friends. It's their colleague. It's their

310
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,310
teammate. That person's opinion really matters
to them. And so, us being able to do anything

311
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:16,379
to coach them and help them succeed and be
knowledgeable and know the answers, is leads

312
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,530
to them doing those activities that we need
them to do so much.

313
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:26,840
So, I want to have a special note on delegation.
So, some things should not be the responsibility

314
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,500
of the AppSec team. When I moved to AppSec,
I did a lot of things that I shouldn't do.

315
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:41,240
There's not enough of me. Not people. I was
a developer for a long time, I would fix security

316
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:51,520
bugs. Don't do that. Don't update frameworks,
plan releases. That's their business. Run

317
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,220
every single scan, implementer. The list is
endless. And not all the security work is

318
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,441
your work. And first of all, don't step on
the Dev's toes. Especially like the Dev manager

319
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:10,070
in assigning who does what bug. Be very cognizant
that you're not stepping on their toes or

320
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:15,689
making them feel like they're a parent telling
them what to do.

321
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,510
Another thing, there's some things we should
not delegate. So, I am a firm believer that

322
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:27,360
we should not make them validate static application
security tool results. Until we've given them

323
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,959
training on it. It's really important. I have
just seen this in so many places. And the

324
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,870
Devs will just disable the SAST tool because
they have crap to get done and there's lots

325
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,809
of false positives and they're like, it's
written in another language that I don't speak.

326
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:45,820
It's really important you give them training
before you expect them to do anything like

327
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,020
that.
Giving security approval on anything. Only

328
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:56,490
your team can give approval. Using new tools
without proper training. Training new champions.

329
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,549
We want a partnership. We do not want replacements
for our team. So, it's really important to

330
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,460
give them a limited list of things you expect
them to do. And then pump them up, train them,

331
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,610
give them everything they need to be awesome
at those things. And, you know, these other

332
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:18,030
things are in the AppSec team's realm and
that's what we do. It can be a slippery slope

333
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,620
sometimes.
So, next we want to recognize our champions.

334
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,739
It is important to recognize them. We want
them to know that they're doing a really good

335
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:34,370
job. And we don't want them to feel like they're
trapped doing two jobs and only receiving

336
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,879
one paycheck. We do not want them to feel
like to kitty. So, this is so, I only have

337
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,000
two kitties in this presentation. I felt like
that was okay. But it's really important that

338
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,360
they feel good about their efforts. That they
feel like we notice, feel like we value them.

339
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,049
Not only the security team, but the management
team that manages them. And so, we don't want

340
00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:00,389
them to feel like this kitty.
So, things that we can do. So, some of these

341
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,120
things you might think, well, they're not
in kindergarten, Tanya. They're not gonna,

342
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,020
you know, they're not gonna like this. Well,
actually, all these things definitely work

343
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:13,280
on me and I'm definitely an adult by now.
Creating a certificate and putting it on their

344
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,289
wall is that says I'm a security champion.
This is something their peers will see and

345
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:26,360
recognize. Oh, cool. That guy's the security
guy. I can ask him stuff. Oh, yeah, she's

346
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:31,830
our champ! Awesome I'm going to see if she
can look at my design. Yes! You want that

347
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,629
person to have their peers know who they are.
You want to recognize them in front of their

348
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,429
peers. So, a lot of stuff is virtual right
now. So, you can actually make a custom virtual

349
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:47,080
background that says, I am a security champion.
It can have a bunch of arrows or stars or

350
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,990
whatever you want. You can put a star next
to their in Teams or Slack, whatever you use

351
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:59,490
for chat. There's lots of different ways.
Another thing that's important is put a note

352
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:05,460
in their performance review that says how
valuable their input was and their participation

353
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:11,740
was. Because you want a permanent record that
they are awesome. This makes them feel good.

354
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,220
It helps them when they're if, you know, you
work at a place where there's bonuses or promotions,

355
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,309
et cetera. You definitely, definitely want
to put a note in their performance review.

356
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:26,100
You want to tell their boss every time they
do something that specifically is awesome,

357
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,939
write the quickest email ever to their boss
to say, you know what? Janet was awesome.

358
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,880
She told me how her team was doing this thing
and she was concerned and so, she invited

359
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,470
me to a meeting so I could give them a bunch
of different options that were less risky.

360
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,150
If she hadn't brought that to my attention,
it could have been 6 or 8 months before we

361
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:51,049
noticed that. I wanted to let you know that
Janet totally rules. Send them an email when

362
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:58,020
they did something. Make sure they know you
noticed and you value what they're doing.

363
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,740
Make the role on their team clear to them
and their peers. Again, that could be just

364
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:09,559
acknowledging them in a meeting. Oh, and this.
I don't always think about cybersecurity.

365
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:13,299
But when I do, it's usually too late. The
most interesting man in the world should think

366
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:19,509
about cybersecurity more often.
So, let's talk about rewarding people. What

367
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:26,089
can we do to reward our champions? I'm a big
fan of reinforcing good behavior instead of

368
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:32,759
punishing bad behavior. And so, I've heard
people say like, Pavlov's dog. Like they would

369
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:39,529
ring a bell, they would get a treat. And,
you know, it sounds weird. But if we constantly

370
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:45,579
reinforce like good things and recognize good
things they do and reward them, they're more

371
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,219
likely to keep doing those things. And so,
not everyone has a budget. So, I worked in

372
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,768
the Canadian government for a long time, and
I was not allowed a budget to buy things for

373
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:59,890
people. But I kid you not, I would bake cookies
and cakes. I kind of like baking. I'm gluten

374
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:06,700
free. So, I often do gluten free baking. But
that still tastes good. I'm pretty good at

375
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,890
it now. And so, I would I would just bake
cookies and be like, hey, I'm going bring

376
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:16,569
these to the lunch and learn. If y'all come
to the meeting. It sounds weird, but that

377
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:20,279
really did it.
Another thing I used to do I had security

378
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:27,609
champions and it was their job to scan their
app and fix all the criticals and highs before

379
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:33,650
they sent it to QA and then eventually it
got to me. I was like, listen, if you send

380
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,320
it to me and there's highs and criticals in
the automated scan in Zap, I will come to

381
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,980
your desk and make fun of you. Which I never
really did. Hey, we have some they were like,

382
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:50,289
I ran out of time. We came up with a reward.
This is going to sound really silly, but my

383
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:57,460
reward was a high five. We worked in an Office
2.0. I hate Office 2.0 for the record. It's

384
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:04,440
so distracting. For this, it was great. There
was this senior executive that was talking

385
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,999
to my boss, and I got an email. Oh, okay.
I saw that the scan came up and it was good.

386
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:16,450
And so, I was like, just one sec. And I ran
across the floor and Stefan, you passed the

387
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:27,799
zap! Really high and loud, high five. All
the other Devs saw that he passed his test.

388
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:35,329
I trotted back to my desk. My boss said, what
are you doing? AppSec. It sounds silly, but

389
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:47,979
that public recognition, Stefan passed every
Zap. He became our secure code librarian.

390
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:53,839
Positive reinforcement really helps.
Things you can do besides high fives. Security

391
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,480
related gifts, books, videos, training, CTFs,
subscriptions, community subscriptions, all

392
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,160
those things. Awesome. So, I, like if, you
know, they program in Java, hey, here's like

393
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,990
five different books that I thought you might
like. Would you like to pick one and I'll

394
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,218
buy it for you? Because I would like to say
thank you for the big efforts that you've

395
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:19,690
done. Giving them your time and attention
as a reward. Took me a long time to realize

396
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,469
that. But you're giving them your undivided
attention. Coming to your desk, turn your

397
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:31,509
body, face them, stop whatever else you are
doing. It sounds weird, but doing that is

398
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:35,339
a reward.
Help them with more than just security. I

399
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:40,450
was a Dev forever. Hey, you want me to help
you squash bugs because you have this deadline?

400
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,808
It sounds weird, but help them with whatever
you can help them with. Let them see everything

401
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:55,369
first, let them help you make decisions. Anything
you can think of just to make them feel valued.

402
00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:01,740
It doesn't have to be a monetary thing. But
whatever you do. I remember I got to go to

403
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:09,258
a security conference once. And I I got to
travel for the first time ever. And I had

404
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:13,749
submitted, and I thought for sure my boss
was gonna say no. And he said, because we

405
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:17,180
worked in the Canadian public service. He's
like, I can't give you a bonus. But you're

406
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,060
above and beyond everyone else. Like you just
you never stop. You do so many things. And

407
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,920
so, I can approve your travel to go to this
conference that I know you really want to

408
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,410
go to, and this can be your bonus. I was like
over the moon. I was way excited. That was

409
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:40,118
better than 500 bucks for me.
Next, don't stop. Please don't stop! So many

410
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,259
companies that succeed, they explode with
their champions program. We're going to do

411
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:52,329
this, that, we're amazing! They have like
three meetings the first month, two the next

412
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:58,299
month, then none for a few months and then
one and they stop and they're exhausted. So,

413
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:04,670
don't stop. It's really important. Paste yourselves.
This is a marathon, this is not a sprint.

414
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,819
First of all, whenever in doubt, overcommunicate.
If you do not communicate regularly, your

415
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:15,038
program will disappear. Even if you just send
out an email. Hey, it's December. There are

416
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,519
a lot of different events happening in December.
There's a lot of people taking holidays because

417
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,368
there's a bunch of really cool religious things
happening and we are not going to have, you

418
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:30,000
know, a security champions event this month.
But we want to say happy holidays to all y'all.

419
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,190
And here is a blog article that I read recently
that I thought was really cool and I thought

420
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,089
I would share with you. And that's it. And
then you wait until January for your next

421
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:45,808
event. But you touched base and that is important.
Your program, it will disappear quickly. I

422
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:52,720
kid you not. I've seen so many programs disappear
quickly. So, don't threat slip. Consistency

423
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,078
is key. Even if you just meet with them once
a month to check in with them and that's all

424
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,309
you do, keep doing it. Some security champions
are gonna need a lot more of your time than

425
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:07,809
others. And some will have better performance
than others. Some of them will be okay. One

426
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:13,450
of my friends I remember telling me, yeah,
I have like 45 security champions and two

427
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:19,020
of them are total deads. They do the bare
minimum every time. But you know what? Like

428
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:25,450
20 are amazing and the other 18 are good.
And so, my program's awesome. So, be aware

429
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:32,828
of that. If you accidently dropped your schedule,
pick it up as soon as you can. Let's say you're

430
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:38,880
sick and you take a month off. When you come
back, try to do something even if it's just

431
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,460
sending an email right away to make sure that
your champions know you exist. You're there.

432
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,970
And they still matter to you.
Culture is a practice. It must be repeated

433
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,249
over and over again. So, if you meditation
or you do yoga or you're like you work out,

434
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:57,828
you go to the gym. You don't just go one time.
I remember seeing this meme where somebody

435
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:04,180
said, I ate a salad once. I didn't lose any
weight. I'm never eating a salad again. It's

436
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,649
so obvious when someone words it that way.
But it's the same with security champions.

437
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:14,279
It is a practice. You must choose every day
to continue doing. It doesn't mean you have

438
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:18,230
to talk to them every day, but you have to
continue this practice regularly or it will

439
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:24,269
evaporate. And it evaporates faster than you
think. And I'm stressing this just because

440
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:29,419
I've seen it so many times.
So, this is the recipe. And we did it. And

441
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,549
we're basically awesome. So, I'm gonna do
a conclusion now. Then I'm gonna give you

442
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:40,420
a bunch of resources and then I'm gonna take
questions. We see high five. That's right.

443
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,959
I love high fives. Okay. So, conclusion. So,
what we learned. So, we learned how to attract

444
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:50,868
people to your program. And if you've attracted
them, that is the right person. We learned

445
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:55,369
a bunch of things about what to teach them
and how to teach them. How to engage and turn

446
00:41:55,369 --> 00:42:02,900
them into advocates for security.
What to delegate. What we should not delegate.

447
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,119
How to motivate them. And basically, like,
in my opinion, how to build an amazing security

448
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:17,890
champion program. Yes! So, this was our recipe.
Recruit, engage, teach, recognize, reward

449
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:24,379
and please don't stop. And so, I'm pretty
sure that a recording of this is gonna be

450
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:30,249
available via The Diana Initiative YouTube
page because every year they do that. And

451
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:35,979
so, my slides should be on my website in a
couple weeks because I'm redoing my SheHacksPurple

452
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:41,921
website. And I'm going to put a link to videos
for everything because I get asked that a

453
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:47,848
lot. And I was like, why don't I just put
it in one place for everyone? Brain!

454
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:53,529
So, some resources. So, awesome books. So,
spoiler alert. I wrote Alice and Bob Learn

455
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:59,910
Application Security. And me and my mom think
it's the best book ever. But I also believe

456
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,828
that you can't do security right if you are
not doing IT right. And so, there's the DevOps

457
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:09,599
handbooks, The Phoenix Project, Accelerate
and the Unicorn Project are books that I recommend,

458
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,849
and I think are really good. They're not free.
This is free. I have a podcast. So, the We

459
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:21,200
Hack Purple Podcast. We talk about different
careers within security and meet with guests

460
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,218
to ask them questions. How did you get to
where you are today and how can I do it too?

461
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:33,660
And so, that's every Thursday live at 6 p.m.
Pacific standard time. On YouTube.

462
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,719
Or you can listen to it later. So, there's
every podcast platform and then also we save

463
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:46,259
them YouTube. So, resources? Me! I have a
YouTube channel. If you want to meet. So,

464
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:52,920
like once per month for all of 2021, Alice
and Bob Learn. So, we're having sessions online.

465
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,259
Live streams and then recordings after of
Alice and Bob. And basically, like people

466
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:03,680
can learn for free about more than just what's
in the book. And I have a newsletter, blah,

467
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,890
blah, blah. We Hack Purple is sponsoring Diana
Initiative. I love Diana Initiative. We have

468
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:21,690
giving away three free courses until 4 p.m.
today. You can go to the newsletter.wehackpurple.com/diana

469
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:28,089
initiative giveaway. Or just go to the We
Hack Purple booth and they'll sign you up

470
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:33,328
there. They know what they're doing. And I
want to wish all of you, that you spend your

471
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:38,619
life doing strange things with weird people.
Because that's what makes me happy. And I

472
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:42,440
want to thank all of you for your time and
attention today. Thank you so very much for

473
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,390
having me at this amazing community event.
I appreciate the entire volunteer team. I

474
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:54,680
appreciate all the organizers who work on
this so hard for so long. I appreciate Maggie

475
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,410
introducing me. I really appreciate all of
you showing up. Because if you didn't show

476
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,450
up, there would be no point in having this
event. So, thank you all. Hi, Maggie.

477
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:09,140
MARGARET: Hi, thank you, Tanya. Thank you
also again to the audience for coming and

478
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:14,259
joining us for the talk and the sponsors.
Tanya, you mentioned that you are willing

479
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:18,950
to take questions now and we do have a little
bit of time. Do we have any questions in the

480
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:26,218
chat? I'm seeing effusive things, a lot of
love. Everyone are huge fans of the We Hack

481
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:31,239
Purple training materials as well. We got
a lot of positive comments about those throughout.

482
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:36,640
TANYA: Awesome. Would it be okay if we like
I don't know if you have the power, if we

483
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,819
like flashed the address to sign up for the
free courses? Because I want everyone to have

484
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:46,729
a chance. I just put it in the private chat.
So, I think if you like click a button you

485
00:45:46,729 --> 00:45:51,529
can make it show up or something.
MARGARET: We don't have a good way to flash

486
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,299
it on screen. But it's in the chat for everyone
else.

487
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:58,700
TANYA: Perfect.
MARGARET: That's the link to sign up for the

488
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:04,038
We Hack Purple giveaway. Hey! Thanks to the
backstage team for hooking us up with the

489
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,469
link.
TANYA: I want everyone to have a chance. My

490
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:15,619
talk is later in the day. I don't want people
to miss it. Yeah, we are giving away a lot

491
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:18,420
of stuff.
MARGARET: That is until 4 p.m., right?

492
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:25,029
TANYA: Yeah. Then we're gonna close it. And
then announce it at the end of Diana Initiative

493
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:28,770
day one.
MARGARET: Four hours and 12 minutes left to

494
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:35,280
sign up, everybody.
TANYA: Awesome. Any questions, or is everyone

495
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,359
like, I'm gonna form a champions program starting
right now? I'm assuming no questions means

496
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,460
you're all going to form one starting Monday.
MARGARET: I'm not seeing questions from the

497
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:50,430
audience. They're feeling confident. Do you
mind if I ask a question of questions?

498
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,160
TANYA: I would love.
MARGARET: As you were talking about different

499
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,200
kinds of rewards, you mentioned high fives
being really good because they're super public.

500
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,049
Do you have a digital high five equivalent
that you like for Slack?

501
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:10,309
TANYA: So, sometimes things I do in Slack,
I have a certain emoticon for the champions.

502
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:16,119
I do a lot of the flexing arm muscle thing.
I'm not sure why. But that's like one of my

503
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:23,049
favorite things. But yeah. Like publicly acknowledging
in the team's channel. So, send a message

504
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:28,288
directly for sure to the champion who did
the thing. But then put it in their team chat.

505
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:33,730
I just to want to thank this person because
they're so awesome and they did this for me.

506
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,799
I also so, this is gonna sound really silly.
But my friend Sean Hooper who speaks a lot

507
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:45,440
at WordPress conferences. I remember him sending
me this once because we were having a virtual

508
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,299
meeting. It's an image that he full screened
and it said, virtual high five, place hand

509
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:58,150
on monitor here. And then we both put our
hand on the screen like this. He said it's

510
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:03,359
the best thing I can get when you're so far
away. Oh, I love it. Sometimes I share that

511
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,920
in meetings. I'm like, virtual high five.
And it's cheesy. But I am cheesy and I'm like

512
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,369
that all the time. So, it fits. You have to
find the thing that's your style if that makes

513
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:18,589
sense. If someone is a really high, introverted
person, they're not go going to run up and

514
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:27,910
give high fives. It can be painful for someone
to do something against their personality.

515
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:34,950
It's finding that thing that works for you.
I'm wearing a bright red and blue dress. I'm

516
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:41,249
loud as a personality type.
But I know a lot of people are not that way.

517
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:45,868
And that's cool. There's lots of ways that
you can recognize people. And you can do things

518
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:52,670
in I don't want to say subversive ways, but
ways that are more introverted. So, for instance,

519
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:59,310
like sending a direct email to their boss,
commending them and CCing them on it. That

520
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:05,020
doesn't have to be a big public thing. But
I don't know if you have had someone do that.

521
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:10,489
But I have had people do that and definitely
it made me turn a hundred shades of red, but

522
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:18,490
in the best way. Oh, my gosh, oh my gosh.
When I worked at Microsoft I remember I traveled

523
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,328
to another one of our offices and the head
that have office sent this wonderful letter

524
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:26,989
to my boss' boss about how my visit across
the ocean was totally worth it because of

525
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:34,979
the all the things we achieved to believe.
And I was like, oh, my thank you! And then

526
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:39,348
they put in my performance review and then
I got a bigger bonus, which is really awesome

527
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:44,309
too. And not expected. That was just like
extra awesome, right? Yeah. There's ways that

528
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:49,859
you can do thing it is you're very extroverted
or if you're not extroverted. But showing

529
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:53,930
people in front of their peers, like recognizing
them in front of their peers. That feels good

530
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,598
for everyone. Yeah. Okay.
MARGARET: Yeah. Thank you. Well, you were

531
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,150
answering my question, a couple of audience
members submitted questions as well. First

532
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:08,839
up, a question from Angelica, how can we help
our security team be a bit friendlier? Most

533
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,019
of their engage suspect from a compliance
standpoint and it scares a lot of nontechnical

534
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:18,160
staff.
TANYA: Angelica, you speak my language. How

535
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,729
can you help the security team be friendlier?
Depends on if you are on the security team

536
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:31,709
or the Dev team. When I was a Dev, the security
team, the last place where I just wrote code

537
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:37,540
full time, they the security team, we called
them the department of no. They would come

538
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:43,349
to meetings and just say no all the time.
And so, when they started coming to meetings

539
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:46,690
so, they would always say, no, you can't do
that. And I would be like, what can I do?

540
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,949
You're a Dev, figure it out. If you were good
at it, you would know. So, I told my manager

541
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:58,199
and their manager, they're not fun to work
with. You can say no to me. That's not a safe

542
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:03,539
way to do it. But can't say no and give you
zero options that work. I'm just gonna like

543
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:14,249
crap on your baby. Because these apps are
my babies. All apps that may team make, they're

544
00:51:14,249 --> 00:51:25,279
my babies too and they're telling me my baby
is ugly in every meeting. I don't want them

545
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:29,959
speaking to the staff. I would say, hi Dr.
No. They would say that's rude. Do you think

546
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:36,319
your behavior is not rude? You need an attitude
adjustment. Their boss gave them a big talk

547
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:45,459
about attitude adjustments, and they weren't
allowed to say no. I'm not allowed to just

548
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:51,029
say no. I can say no you can't do that, but
and I have to give you solutions. And sometimes

549
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:56,479
I don't know the answers. So, we started having
brainstorming sessions. And sometimes it would

550
00:51:56,479 --> 00:52:03,379
just mean I remember one gave me the Microsoft
SDLC book DHS thick. They dropped it on my

551
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:11,599
desk. It was heavy and there was a boom sound.
There, you can know security. It took a while

552
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:19,849
to warm them up of just saying, you want me
to get this work done? You have to work with

553
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:25,819
me. And so, tell them, if they're just gonna
say no, that that's not good enough. Like,

554
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:30,009
their job is security. Help me figure out
the security thing. And so, at first, like,

555
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:33,819
they would start with shaming me. Well, if
you were a good Dev, you would know. But by

556
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:37,839
that three and a half years, by the time I
quit, they're like, okay, Tanya, so, your

557
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,640
team is doing this thing and we don't like
it. Okay. What are we gonna to do instead?

558
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,199
He was like, I have some options. And it was
so much better. And stopped calling them Dr.

559
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:51,740
No and started calling them by their names.
And relations got better and better and better.

560
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:58,939
When I moved to the next company again, I
had to build that bridge and that's why I

561
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,650
became the AppSec person. Because I am the
bridge now. But yeah. It's a lot of telling

562
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:09,660
them that their behavior, how it made me feel.
And they're just like and it's weird also

563
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,959
being like usually the only woman on every
team. Right? And so, they're like, the woman

564
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:16,788
wants to talk about her feelings. Yeah, and
you're going to sit down and listen because

565
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:23,869
I'm the tech lead. You're making my Devs feel
bad. My Devs don't want to come to meetings

566
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:28,119
with you. That's not acceptable for me. You
cannot be mean to my team. I am their mama

567
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:35,150
bear. I will protect them.
MARGARET: That is a great answer, and you

568
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:39,089
covered the other question in the chat. Which
is extra great because we are at time.

569
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:41,969
TANYA: Okay.
MARGARET: Thank you again, Tanya, for this

570
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:47,829
excellent advice and inspiration on building
security champions programs for all of our

571
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:52,259
companies. Hopefully everybody is ready to
go out and do that. Don't forget to sign up

572
00:53:52,259 --> 00:54:01,079
