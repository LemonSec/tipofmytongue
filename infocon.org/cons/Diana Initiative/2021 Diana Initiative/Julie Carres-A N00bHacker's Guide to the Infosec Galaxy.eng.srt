art history

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
degree to teach math which okay i was a

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,600
music major in urban computers but

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,400
somehow when you read it all got into

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
computer security via defcon and many

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,400
other twists and turns and now we're

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,960
gonna hear how she's used all of that

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
fun stuff

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
and brought it into a new hacker's guide

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,079
to the info sex

28
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,799
infosec galaxy

29
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,320
joker please take it away

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
hi everyone

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
welcome welcome uh

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
to my closet and to the new packers

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
guide to the infosec galaxy or how i

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
stopped worrying and learned to love the

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,840
ctf

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
um

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
if you notice that there's some

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,200
inconsistencies in the colors and

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,680
boldnesses of the text that's because i

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
love ctfs and challenges so much that i

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,759
actually wove one through my talk so

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,840
grab a pencil and paper or whatever you

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,160
have nearby if you feel like taking on a

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,878
little mini challenge here and we're

45
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,120
gonna get started all right so

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
obligatory linux joke here um and as

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
mentioned i teach math with my art

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
history degree and um i've had 17 years

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
in the classroom stumbled into defcon

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
didn't even know what it hit me it just

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
you know went from fangirl to hobbyist

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
to now i'm changing my career and um

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,400
i as i went along used so many fun

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
different resources to get me to where i

55
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
am now which is still a noob but it was

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
enough to get me accepted to the sans

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
women's immersion academy which i'm

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,239
going to be starting

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
and um so i'm using this resource as um

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,519
or i'm using this talk to sort of

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
be a resource for everybody

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
um

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
who really wants to motivate yourself

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
to learn an infosec without having to

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
push yourself

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
okay so we want to motivate ourselves

67
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,800
because face it at the end of the day

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
after you've worked an entire day

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
possibly

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,599
commuted home possibly not during coven

71
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
then maybe taking care of child care

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
things and then in dinner and then it's

73
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,599
like eight o'clock and as much as i love

74
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
no search press sometimes it is

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
exhausting to think about opening up a

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,720
book

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,599
getting out that highlighter and trying

78
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,360
you know it's it's that can be a hard

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
way to learn and especially if you're

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
getting into infosec

81
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
or even if you're just trying to do

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
professional development that can be a

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
tricky thing to do at like nine o'clock

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
at night when you finally have some free

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
time so the answer to that you know how

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
do you keep yourself from doing what i

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
used to do which is just play skyrim all

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
night is you have to know your learning

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,439
style

90
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,400
um

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,599
and you have to make it as fun

92
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,400
as challenging and as rewarding as

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
playing skyrim all night so

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
gamified learning um

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
nist which is the national institute for

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
standards in technology has a working

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
group called nice

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
which is the national initiative for

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,360
cyber security education

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
they have a strategic plan and one of

101
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
those objectives is to advocate for

102
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,040
multidisciplinary approaches that

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
integrate cyber security across varied

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
curricula

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
to support diverse learners from a

106
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,120
variety of backgrounds and experiences

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,080
so

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
one of the ways they mention

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
gamification and that is why i love the

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
ctf

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
so a quick table of contents we're going

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
to talk about

113
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
are you an alice or are you a jill are

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
you down a rabbit hole or are you

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
learning all trades mastering none

116
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
this learning style um is just going to

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
help us sort of choose some of the types

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
of resources we might like to use and

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
think about what will strengthen us

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
versus

121
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
where we need uh or what will sort of

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
entice us and what will strengthen us as

123
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,840
learners

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
um

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,639
then of course we're going to talk about

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
ctfs and why they were actually more fun

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
than playing breath of the wild which is

128
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
almost heresy but you know true for me

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,720
um and then coding because we all need a

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
little bit of coding how we're going to

131
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
get our coding learning accomplished in

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,400
a fun way

133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
um what child sites are and some of the

134
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,280
favorite ones that i have used and how

135
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
they just sort of

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
will sort of suck you down a fun rabbit

137
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,759
hole um and then projects and family

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
time things that you can do as an

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
infosec learner or as someone who's

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,759
developing themselves

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,639
to

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,479
just get some hands-on experience and of

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,280
course

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,199
because if you do have

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
youngsters in the house

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
nice to have a little bit of stuff that

147
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
you can do with them while you're still

148
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
learning so that you don't feel like

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,039
you're completely neglecting them

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,919
because that ctf was so fun

151
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,039
all right

152
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
so

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
here we have two

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
oddly specific scenarios

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
we have alice down her rabbit hole so if

156
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
you are an alice type of person when it

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
is time to learn you open up youtube

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
choose a networking video by professor

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
messer which if you don't know professor

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
messer do check him out he's awesome

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
and you know whenever he mentions

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
something you don't understand you're

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
like what is that i have to look that up

164
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,240
i can't proceed until i know all about

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,639
this thing and then four hours later you

166
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,199
could write like a dissertation on the

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
thing but then

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
you never finished the video and sort of

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,039
cons like continued outside of the

170
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,440
concept like to the end of the concept

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
on the other hand you might be jill of

172
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,080
all trades master of none and when it's

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
time for you to learn you open up

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
youtube you choose a video by oh

175
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,639
that's a

176
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,880
sparkly and i would like to know how to

177
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
count in binary on my fingers and and

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
you know then it just you know spirals

179
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,280
into one thing to the next thing the

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
next thing and four hours later

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
you know lots of really cool things

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
on early surface level but you don't

183
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
really know how they relate to each

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
other so um

185
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
you know

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
most people fall on a scale from one

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
side to the others you have jills

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
alice's chalices

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
lls

190
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,919
um but if you relate more to being an

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,599
alice you're probably more of a deep

192
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,240
dive specialist um you might be the type

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
of person who's unsatisfied with cursory

194
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,039
knowledge right you need to know how it

195
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,280
works it's not enough to just know the

196
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
acronym and kind of go okay file that

197
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,639
away for later like

198
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,280
why is it called fiber channel if it

199
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
doesn't have to run over fiber you know

200
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
you have to know these things um you

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,599
might be the type of person who can pick

202
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,000
a topic and really stick with it until

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
mastery

204
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
you might be enticed by one deep

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
immersive task like today i could not

206
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
pull myself away from one really hard

207
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,520
ctf question even though i knew i could

208
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,639
probably go and do the easier one but i

209
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,360
wanted to get the

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,199
and the only problem with that is you

211
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
might go too deep into unimportant

212
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,160
topics

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
you might spend too much time on only

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
one thing well i was deep today into one

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,879
question on the ctf my friend was like

216
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,479
like getting all the

217
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,199
answers because she was doing more stuff

218
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,560
um

219
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
you might need to broaden your focus as

220
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
an alice you know you might be really

221
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
focused on one thing now the world needs

222
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
specialists so as you go into your

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
intercept career that might be an

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,919
advantage and might be something you

225
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
want to go for just really good at azure

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
or something like that um but you know

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
as a learner you don't really know where

228
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
you're going to go so you kind of might

229
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,799
want to broaden your focus a little bit

230
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,919
um if you're a jill of all trades master

231
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
of none you're more of a broad

232
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,320
generalist and that's actually a good

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
thing um there's some research that's

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,679
been done and gosh it's not on the tip

235
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
of my tongue right now

236
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
that shows that generalists are

237
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
incredibly useful and we kind of need

238
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
more of them we need somebody who can

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
step in fiddle around a bit and go i'm

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
not sure how that worked but uh i fixed

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
it okay we need those people um and you

242
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
are the person who knows a little bit

243
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,839
about a lot of things you're curious

244
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,880
about

245
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
everything like there's no topic that

246
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
you're like ah that sounds boring

247
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
that sounds cool tell me more

248
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,399
um you're very enticed by variety

249
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
and you can skim topics and learn quite

250
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
a bit just enough to be dangerous

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
um but you may spend too little time on

252
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
these topics so that you don't get that

253
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,959
deep underlying knowledge you have a

254
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
general idea of it maybe a couple tricks

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
but you don't have that deep knowledge

256
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,600
so you as opposed to an alice who needs

257
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
to broaden her focus might need to

258
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,279
narrow your focus more frequently

259
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,920
so why do we talk about this

260
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,160
because the resources that we're going

261
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
to be talking about

262
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,519
especially specifically like ctfied

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
learning resources

264
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
um will play to your strengths some of

265
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,440
them you're going to want to use them

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
because they'll play to your strengths

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
and some of them you're going to want to

268
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
use them because they will strengthen

269
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
your weaknesses

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
so capture the flag um is gamified

271
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
learning for diverse learners

272
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
just in case you are here and still

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
don't know what a ctf is which is fine

274
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
because it might not be your thing or

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
you've heard it and have never really

276
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,880
tried one

277
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
it's you know and digital competition

278
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
for infosec professionals where we all

279
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,959
go hunting a flag which is just a little

280
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,320
text string and usually there's some

281
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
fancy curly brackets around it and it's

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,959
often written in leetspeak and

283
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,120
it's buried inside various machines in

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
different places and the goal of course

285
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
is to test your information security

286
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
knowledge

287
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
to see if you can uncover these flags

288
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,760
and as you uncover them you learn about

289
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
how things are built and how to take

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
things apart

291
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,959
um

292
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,800
so a lot of cts like for example the one

293
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,920
we have running today i think they're

294
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
like four cts running today at tdi which

295
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
is awesome um

296
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
there's a time limit and you're trying

297
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
to get as many points as you can because

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,279
every time you get a flag you get more

299
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,480
points and

300
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,800
um they can be really competitive like

301
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
some of these people get into teams and

302
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
stay up all night it's like a hackathon

303
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
and that can really turn some people off

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
the competitive nature of it um so

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
these are not that

306
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
um

307
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
these are resources that are ctf style

308
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,320
uh learning resources there's no time

309
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
limits there's no pressure learn at your

310
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,040
own pace in fact some of them have

311
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
complete write-ups online we'll talk

312
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,000
about that so that you can do your

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,040
learning

314
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
so if you are a jill why are ctfs good

315
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,040
for you if you you know identify as jill

316
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,519
you are going to love the variety cts

317
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
require you to have lots of different

318
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,720
skills um but you are gonna need to do a

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
little bit deeper research to really

320
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,279
advance quit like as far as you want to

321
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
in a ctf

322
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,200
and alice it's good for you all because

323
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
it pushes you to do things in a variety

324
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,000
of topics you can't just stick to oceans

325
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
and just do oceans you have to if you

326
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
want to

327
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
push yourself you're going to have like

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
to progress in the ctf you're going to

329
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,279
need to do lots of different topics

330
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,399
so

331
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,079
on the bright side as you do that just

332
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,360
like jill's going to need to do you get

333
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
to go down your little rabbit holes

334
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
along the way so we're going to talk

335
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920

the joke i've had is like shit's creek

347
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
level self-improvement like going from

348
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,399
absolutely nothing

349
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,839
to really using some powerful tools and

350
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,040
actually you know hacking some boxes

351
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,399
um

352
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
it's a ctf style educational platform

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
and they have hundreds of rooms you've

354
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,399
probably heard that term if you've never

355
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,839
seen try hack me i'm going to show you

356
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
kind of what a room looks like

357
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,360
um and for free you have two hours per

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
day on their vms for free

359
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
you can also use your own vm and um you

360
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
know connect with them and then you

361
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,000
don't have to worry about the time limit

362
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,839
um and one of the great things about

363
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
tryhackme is they have these curated

364
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,279
learning paths

365
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,880
and i'm going to show you

366
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
here look at that

367
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
all these different learning paths that

368
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
you can take starting from right in the

369
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,440
middle complete beginner and whoops

370
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,360
apparently i knocked out my

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
starting from complete beginner

372
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,199
start my presentation again okay um

373
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,880
and

374
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
that's really gonna take you from

375
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
this is a computer all the way up

376
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,519
through

377
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,440
like

378
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
i mean really being ready to start

379
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,639
something like cyber defense or

380
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
offensive pen testing right um

381
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,279
web application security is in your

382
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,959
complete beginner

383
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
you know scripting all kinds of amazing

384
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
skills so um

385
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,000
that is going to be great

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,519
for jill's

387
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
if you're a jill and you like to just

388
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,480
kind of go everywhere and don't know

389
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
what to do because there's so much stuff

390
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,959
out there

391
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,480
and everything's fun

392
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
awesome this will keep you focused once

393
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
you do this go on to the next thing it's

394
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
a curriculum

395
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,199
um and for alice that's going to play to

396
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,240
your strengths you're going to love

397
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
these deep dives

398
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,880
um

399
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,199
lots of resources for when you get stuck

400
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
they have all kinds of write-ups and

401
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
things online

402
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
um some of the early rooms even have a

403
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
video walkthrough for if you get super

404
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,160
stuck which has actually come in handy

405
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
for me before and here we have instead

406
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
of a curriculum just a whole bunch of

407
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
rooms

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,880
um

409
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
and you can see at the bottom here like

410
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,360
there are

411
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
i'm on page 13. there's no end in sight

412
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
here people are adding rooms all the

413
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
time there are so many rooms and look

414
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
look at some of the stuff you've got

415
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
cross-site scripting and it's an easy

416
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
room they're going to understand how it

417
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
occurs how to exploit it they're going

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
to teach you how to do that exploit so

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
if you're interested in red teaming or

420
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,480
if you're a blue teamer who needs to

421
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
know how to defend against such a thing

422
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,360
there it is the hacker methodology a

423
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,279
whole room on the hacker methodology

424
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,120
love it um so so many topics um

425
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,519
and again um alice you can just follow

426
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,880
all the topics on one thing all the way

427
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
down your rabbit hole and jill you can

428
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,160
dilly dally around but you know

429
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,880
recommend sticking to that that learning

430
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
uh curriculum this is what it looks like

431
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,880
inside of one of the rooms you can see

432
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
on the right there's a very succinct

433
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
lesson lots of nice highlighting for

434
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
anything that is a command

435
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,839
um

436
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,680
and then on the

437
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,120
sorry right i don't right and left on

438
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
the left there's a lesson on the right

439
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
uh is their attack box which is their vm

440
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
that you can get for two hours a day

441
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
free it's just you know want a linux

442
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
terminal here you go you can use that

443
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
linux terminal to connect to their

444
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,040
vulnerable machines and do anything you

445
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
need to do you can do any of their boxes

446
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
from that terminal of course you can

447
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,639
make your own as well if you prefer to

448
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,560
have your own like cali or parrot spun

449
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,399
up um and then after each you know

450
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
little lesson there's a task and so

451
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
use what you've learned use our vm do

452
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
the task

453
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,759
cool put the answer in and how is this

454
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,199
like a ctf because there are little

455
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
flags and so the this in this case is

456
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
more of a learning style room but some

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,079
of the rooms are more like once you have

458
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,519
enough of the learning style rooms under

459
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,759
your belt some of them are more hacking

460
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,279
style rooms where you really need to

461
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
just find flags and enter flags which is

462
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,720
awesome

463
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,160
all right

464
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,880
we're going to talk about pico ctf

465
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
which one of the things i love about

466
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,320
pico ctf is it when i get one of these

467
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
challenges right it gives me this huge

468
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,399
dopamine hit like i feel so happy

469
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,399
like it's that same like when you get

470
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
that happy dance music when link is

471
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,199
cooking and you know it's gonna be a

472
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,759
really good recipe

473
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,399
it's like it's even better than that so

474
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,440
um it's a jeopardy style ctf which means

475
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,199
that and i'll just again i'll just skip

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,559
forward and show you

477
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
you see those little boxes there each of

478
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,079
these obedient cat and wave of

479
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
flag and things like that

480
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,599
each of those it's like a jeopardy board

481
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
you get to pick your challenge give it a

482
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
try it's not working out or it's harder

483
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,039
i'm stuck on it i'm going to try

484
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,720
something else you can look at the

485
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
levels on it the difficulties usually

486
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,679
indicated by the point value not always

487
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,480
um

488
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
and it again is this broad

489
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,640
range

490
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
of skills that you are going to need

491
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
in order to

492
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,679
progress and you know learn so um

493
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
to progress in the ctf

494
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,919
yay jill's going to love it plays to

495
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,679
agile strengths it's going to force an

496
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,240
alice to run their learning

497
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,799
um it includes a built-in web shell sort

498
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,480
of like um

499
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,640
try hack me does i think that was open

500
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,679
on the screen and these are all things

501
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,760
web exploitation binary exploitation

502
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
cryptography all of these things

503
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
are

504
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
taught at picoctf and if you're sitting

505
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,480
there thinking i'm a beginner

506
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,799
like i'm

507
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,120
i don't know what binary exploitation is

508
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,039
binary is just a fancy linux word for

509
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,240
program

510
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
still how do we exploit it right

511
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
um

512
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
well

513
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
if you look at this pico ctf designed by

514
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,400
carnegie mellon

515
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,080
six domains of cyber security

516
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,919
for

517
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,039
middle and high school students

518
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,440
it is really designed to take you

519
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
from zero to a hundred

520
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
and now that you've seen that it's oh

521
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
it's designed for middle school students

522
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
there's some of you going sweet this is

523
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,640
exactly what i need and there's others

524
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,990
of you going seems a little easy

525
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,360
[Music]

526
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,640
i don't think so

527
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,919
a lot of the write-ups that you'll see

528
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,200
and we talk about that too there's

529
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
fantastic support

530
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
a lot of the write-ups for the

531
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
challenges on pico ctf that i have seen

532
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
are not in fact by high school students

533
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
or even by college students they're by

534
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
professionals who are training

535
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,400
themselves and writing up on their blog

536
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
how they figured out how to exploit some

537
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
of the challenges in pico ctf they are

538
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,120
not easy folks um

539
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
which doesn't mean that

540
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,039
all of them are that hard but you can

541
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,679
get a nice range from sufficiently

542
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,320
challenging through nice and easy work

543
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
your way up and here you can see there's

544
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
a tab that says learn there are tons of

545
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,720
resources on that tab for you to learn

546
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
from and like i mentioned all you have

547
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
to do is because these are all old ctf

548
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
questions they're not the current pico

549
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
ctf competitive questions so they post

550
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
them and you are allowed to

551
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
um do write ups it's a great thing to

552
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,520
put on your blog um

553
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,960
and you can read other people's

554
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
write-ups if you get totally stuck

555
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
it's great

556
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,160
so over the wire is a fun one it's

557
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,919
really bare bones and simple this one

558
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
kind of makes me feel like i'm you know

559
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,840
in mr robot

560
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
uh because it's just sort of simple it's

561
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
like a console and it's linux

562
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,280
and you're

563
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,159
you know you're hacking and um it's a

564
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,240
war game site and a war game site just

565
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,360
means

566
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
um

567
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
it's got vulnerable machines for you to

568
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
do challenges in um

569
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,039
and

570
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,280
so this one again will take you from

571
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,559
very beginner

572
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,559
to advanced and you have to ssh in to

573
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
the machine and you

574
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,559
figure out by the way if you're going i

575
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,080
don't know how to do that uh the first

576
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
challenge is learn how to ssh into a

577
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
machine so they got you covered

578
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,480
and what i like about it is it it gives

579
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,200
you lots of hands-on with linux

580
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
it encourages good googling practices if

581
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
you look at you know their support

582
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,400
they'll be like oh why don't you google

583
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,960
these terms or um if you're not sure how

584
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,799
to do it look it up on the web we all

585
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,400
need to learn how to use google as

586
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
information security professionals

587
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
or duckduckgo or whatever you'd like um

588
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
but they do have discord and irc

589
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
communities to support you um but here's

590
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,720
a screenshot

591
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,280
bandit is their lowest level one

592
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,679
what what is great as an educator for me

593
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
and one of the things i like about this

594
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,159
is

595
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,360
if the first challenge is ssh in

596
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,799
and then they give you the password you

597
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
log back out you have the password for

598
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
the next one you have to ssh in using

599
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
the password you just found then you

600
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,840
have to do something else you have to

601
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,159
use the ls command or something

602
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,440
all right you use the ls command you've

603
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
got the next password you log out login

604
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
is level three

605
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
do something else but each time it

606
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,360
repeats so each time you have to ssh in

607
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,760
use ls find the next thing okay and then

608
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
it builds ssh and use ls find the next

609
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
thing find the next thing and so it

610
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
repeats and then you just find that

611
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,000
before you know it you're flying and

612
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
you're using these things very naturally

613
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
as a teacher i love the way it scaffolds

614
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,679
you into higher learning um and you can

615
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,520
see this is me feeling feeling like

616
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
elliot on my powershell

617
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
all right

618
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,039
um

619
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,039
the final ctf style challenge we're

620
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,880
gonna talk about is the sans holiday

621
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
hack challenge

622
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,520
um and i like this one because i it's

623
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,960
like an mmo crossed with a ctf

624
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,039
and i was a long time world of warcraft

625
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,159
player but i gotta

626
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,720
say the guitars on this one even better

627
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,600
than world of warcraft um

628
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,039
they

629
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
have little avatars that walk around and

630
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,039
interact with a little world and give

631
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,400
you little challenges that you try to

632
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
solve

633
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
and these are some more advanced

634
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
challenges but some are beginner

635
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,200
challenges and they are absolutely not

636
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
impossible

637
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
um and as you walk around you'll see

638
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,679
other people as well

639
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,480
depending um but every year they drop a

640
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
new one

641
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,440
like an expansion

642
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,679
and um people go through and try to

643
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
solve the challenge but they leave the

644
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
others up so they're available all the

645
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
time and these there are

646
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
um 11 of them now because they go back

647
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
to 2010.

648
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,280
um

649
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,400
there's 10 of them because they haven't

650
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,799
done the 21 yet yeah there we go math

651
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,400
math teacher um so

652
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,720
they're pretty in-depth and

653
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
when as a beginner you start off you

654
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,080
feel pretty good you notice some stuff

655
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,159
you're doing some things completing some

656
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,600
quests

657
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,240
and then you get stuck that's okay

658
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
because

659
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,720
again once someone wins the holiday hack

660
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
challenge

661
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
and the winner is verified sans

662
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,679
announces it and then lets everyone else

663
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,760
post their walkthroughs and their

664
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
tutorials and all kinds of things so you

665
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
can find walkthroughs and tutorials and

666
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,320
that's going to get you what i like

667
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,159
you know as a teacher again

668
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
i always give out the answer sheets

669
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,440
to

670
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,120
homework assignments because if you're

671
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,880
stuck you need to know how to reverse

672
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
engineer that answer

673
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,159
and so

674
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,279
if you're stuck

675
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,720
you're not going to get anywhere without

676
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,400
help and so then as you're watching

677
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,679
someone else do it and walk you through

678
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
it you're getting all these new amazing

679
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,919
you know skills and tricks and all this

680
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
new knowledge so it's totally worth

681
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
trying it on your own until you get

682
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,240
stuck looking up the answers taking

683
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
notes on what you can do and then who

684
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,279
knows maybe you use that for the next

685
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
holiday hack challenge you use some of

686
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,240
the tricks you learned

687
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,600
um

688
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
here's a screenshot of it like i said

689
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,679
that's me hypersparkle and uh yeah you

690
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,360
know the avatars better than world of

691
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
warcraft right what did i tell you

692
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
um and as you look around

693
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,240
you can walk your avatar around amazing

694
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,320
animation it goes

695
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,360
and

696
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,600
as you look around these people are npcs

697
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,880
you talk to them they give you

698
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,159
challenges

699
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,919
you interact with objects they give you

700
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,000
challenges uh there's some chat over

701
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
here for people who want to talk to each

702
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,400
other and there's a discord um for

703
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,679
example clicking on this picture of

704
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,039
santa

705
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,640
there's a challenge in there and there's

706
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,320
stuff hidden in the picture and that's

707
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
going to apply to some other challenge

708
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
somewhere else and so it's this big it's

709
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,679
sort of just a gigantic puzzle game with

710
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
you know information security forward

711
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
challenges

712
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,039
very awesome

713
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,880
so you know just talking in general

714
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
about ctfs

715
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,520
they are not just for

716
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,679
you know

717
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,200
people who want to get a black badge at

718
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
defcon

719
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,360
they're like these resources are

720
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
amazing ways to

721
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,039
give yourself a challenge feel

722
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,919
accomplished as you go along

723
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,440
and learn so so much whether you

724
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
are you know a jill of all trades who

725
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
needs to focus a little more on one

726
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
thing some of these resources are going

727
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,279
to keep you more focused and whether

728
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,880
you're an alice down your rabbit hole

729
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
and you really

730
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,720
need to look at more than just your

731
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,919
rabbit hole

732
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,720
both of those all of those things offer

733
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
either a broadening or a narrowing of

734
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
focus that you're going to need

735
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,440
all right

736
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
let's talk about coding before we head

737
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,679
on like just just a little bit of coding

738
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
before we go into child sites and before

739
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
we go into projects and family time

740
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
why are we talking about coding we're

741
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,000
not becoming devs we're becoming

742
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
information security professionals

743
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
i think

744
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320
anytime you're working with computers

745
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
it's probably good to know a little bit

746
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
about coding that's what they run on

747
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,120
they run on code

748
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
and of course depending on the field you

749
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,039
get into um

750
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,200
scripting i mean that is listed all over

751
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,320
every single resume request not resume

752
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,640
request every single you know job

753
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
posting i've ever seen

754
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
if you're reverse engineering of course

755
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,039
you really need to know software

756
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,279
devsecops malware analysis web

757
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,480
exploitation gotta know some of that

758
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,600
javascript

759
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
so um it's good to have just sort of

760
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,840
even i'm not trying to you know gatekeep

761
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
with this i know that there are

762
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,360
absolutely infosecrals that don't need

763
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
coding um but it is good to know and if

764
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,320
you're feeling like you need to

765
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,039
juice up your coding skills here are

766
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,640
some ways you can do that

767
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
now if you

768
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,799
um

769
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
feel like you're an alice type of person

770
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
you may prefer some actual college

771
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,000
classes um these four classes here that

772
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
i've posted are free online completely

773
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
free

774
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,039
and what they do of course is they

775
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,720
give you very high level very quality

776
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,679
instruction homework assignments that

777
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
actually because they're on these online

778
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
platforms are able to be graded

779
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,120
and um

780
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,279
you know feedback evaluation a community

781
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,039
to work with it's like taking a college

782
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,159
class um coursera's uh works with

783
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,919
princeton university to offer computer

784
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,880
science

785
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
um two different ones uh that class made

786
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,320
me cry but boy did it get me good at

787
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,679
java um that one's java the harvard one

788
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,360
is i believe c

789
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
and that's on edx and then georgia tech

790
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,720
has a python one that's excellent

791
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,960
um and so

792
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,080
if you really want to put yourself

793
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,000
through it um these are fun classes

794
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
they're very very worthwhile

795
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
on the other hand we were talking about

796
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,960
gamification weren't we those weren't

797
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
really gamified it's just that i know

798
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,799
some people prefer that route um if

799
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,320
you're a jill you might prefer something

800
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
a little more open-ended starting off if

801
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,159
you've never coded in your life before

802
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,640
with scratch um it was created um

803
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
by mit to get young people coding but

804
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,480
then it sort of has gone far beyond it

805
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
in fact the harvard cs50 class that i

806
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,279
linked to

807
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,279
um on the previous page

808
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,960
uses scratch

809
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
to teach computer science principles um

810
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,640
it's drag and drop code blocks and it's

811
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,080
fun and actually i'm gonna go you're

812
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
gonna see quick demos of each of these

813
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,520
in a minute um so i'm not gonna go too

814
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
into depth code combat is after you're

815
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,679
sort of done with scratch you might be

816
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,279
ready to instead of drag and drop your

817
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,360
code you might be ready to actually type

818
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
your code

819
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
and code combat is that

820
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,120
sort of um

821
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,720
push

822
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
to get out of just drag and dropping and

823
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,200
uh if a lot of times thinking about

824
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
coding makes you

825
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,960
sad then well code combat is completely

826
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
like a top-down rpg it's a video game

827
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,120
um

828
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,919
codecademy is the more like once you've

829
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,600
got some your legs underneath you with

830
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,279
scratch and code combat and you really

831
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,960
want to just like hey i need to learn

832
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,799
some pure python

833
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,440
and do it in a more you know applicable

834
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,240
context codecademy has tons of different

835
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,840
languages and is the more sort of adult

836
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,000
version of this um and we're going to

837
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
see quick demos of them if my

838
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,520
demos are working well here

839
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,918
all right

840
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,559
oh wait i need to pause because hold on

841
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,760
i need to make sure that i am sharing

842
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
my

843
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
hold on one second

844
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,120
ooh

845
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,200
my av person might ding me for this i

846
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,960
need to make sure that i'm sharing my

847
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,960
um

848
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,039
there we go

849
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,760
sorry for that

850
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,320
all right here we go no not just for

851
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,360
kids

852
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,959
i'm going to show you a brief

853
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,399
so here we have two what they call

854
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,399
sprites

855
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,799
over here you can see all of our little

856
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,480
code blocks all those little functions

857
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
that are built in for us

858
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
and we're going to start with an event

859
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,399
the event is

860
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,880
when this gets clicked when the screen

861
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,640
gets clicked

862
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
we want the cat to continue to walk

863
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,559
around so

864
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,080
under control we're going to put what's

865
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,559
called a forever block

866
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,960
all right so forever

867
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
we want the cat here's motion

868
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,600
to glide one second position

869
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,120
and

870
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,520
now if it lands somewhere where it's

871
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
touching there

872
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,519
okay so we need a conditional over here

873
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
under controls we also have conditionals

874
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,679
so if something happens well what is

875
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,399
happening we want it to touch there if

876
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,240
touching and this says mouse pointer but

877
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,600
i'm going to use the drop down i need to

878
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,640
say if touching there

879
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
we're going to

880
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,080
say

881
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
ah

882
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,679
for one second

883
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,279
and otherwise we're just going to

884
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,080
say hello world

885
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,679
i'm gonna fit in there

886
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,279
say

887
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,080
hello world

888
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
all right we're gonna play it let's see

889
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,330
what happens

890
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,799
[Music]

891
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,960
around says hello world ah touch the

892
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,720
bear hello world

893
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
ah touch the bear okay you get the idea

894
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
very basic program took me three seconds

895
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,880
to throw together

896
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,120
where does this lead you well

897
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,519
depending on how ambitious or creative

898
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,000
you want to be here is a scratcher who

899
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
has designed an entire

900
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
make it large so we can see

901
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,840
video game experience called koi pond

902
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,559
all right you can't even have a

903
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,320
soundtrack i'm gonna need that

904
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,360
here we go start and look at this

905
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,880
this is all

906
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,399
something that you can learn from a

907
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,000
tutorial

908
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,440
just lying around and oh i died so it

909
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,399
keeps score as your best your worst

910
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,679
it even has

911
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,080
how play

912
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
right

913
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,159
so um

914
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,880
scratch is a wide open

915
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,240
playground

916
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,039
start with the basics build into very

917
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,399
impressive

918
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,799
video games great way to learn to code

919
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,399
all right talking combat

920
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,640
code combat

921
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
is a learning platform that plays like a

922
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,919
video game

923
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,840
usually in a video game

924
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,240
you would be pushing buttons or using

925
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,799
your controller to move your character

926
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,679
around

927
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,640
to complete scenarios and win the game

928
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,519
fight the monsters

929
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,360
in this case the monsters know what

930
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,960
they're doing they have programmed ai

931
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
just like in a regular video game but

932
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,240
you have to program your hero to do the

933
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,840
things it needs to do to win each

934
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,399
level so here we have um

935
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,919
an early level

936
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,799
uh programming in javascript

937
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,840
this platform supports javascript python

938
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,080
c plus if you subscribed and

939
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,480
coffeescript and it also has

940
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,399
html you have we have some levels where

941
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,240
it teaches you html web development and

942
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,840
game development

943
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,360
but at the moment you're looking at an

944
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,200
early level and it's trying to teach you

945
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,360
as you see over here there's a level set

946
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,960
and it's trying to

947
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,760
teach you a very succinct lesson okay

948
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,000
instead of just using a method you can

949
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,079
use an argument to the method

950
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,760
there we go we can see the hero moves

951
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,399
right too not just once

952
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,280
so over here here are your methods

953
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
it's showing you

954
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,199
where you need to go

955
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,839
you gotta use five lines of code or less

956
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,199
and they already gave you a little

957
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,679
starter they moved to redhead3

958
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,359
and

959
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,918
we're gonna start again now we have to

960
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,159
avoid this monster over here so

961
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,639
let's see it auto fills for you if you'd

962
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,960
like

963
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,359
two hours later

964
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,760
anyway you guys get the ideas so there

965
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,079
it is

966
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,839
you can see it move down to each line is

967
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,440
it and then you're gonna see if you make

968
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
it out alive yep i got blown up

969
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
this is a very simple level some of the

970
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
more advanced levels

971
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,680
and we made our goals

972
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
then it gives you a little dopamine hit

973
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,680
lets you earn prizes

974
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,240
um you get bonuses for clean code that

975
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
kind of thing um

976
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,119
and this is sort of what the setup looks

977
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,640
like once you finish a level you can see

978
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,240
i've just finished a couple levels to

979
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
show you some of the deeper levels paper

980
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,240
levels in um

981
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,680
and then look at that

982
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,119
all through here

983
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,599
all these different things are levels

984
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,359
they will give you a lesson and then

985
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,640
they will have you practice and give you

986
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,720
a lesson and have you practice um you

987
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
can choose different heroes they're nice

988
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
and diverse and the first four are free

989
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
and then you can pay for extra

990
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,359
and oh and in that as well you can see

991
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,160
where you choose your language at any

992
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,119
time you feel like choosing your

993
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,720
language you can go ahead and do that so

994
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,160
you can see

995
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,079
that this is where you start

996
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,680
and they're teaching syntax methods

997
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,760
parameters strings loops variables

998
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,240
and then once you finish this you unlock

999
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,320
the other content so

1000
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
teaching if else boolean logic

1001
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,920
relational operators functions object

1002
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,000
properties event handling you can read

1003
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,800
it there's lots of different levels

1004
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,040
98 110 46 so it's a really fun platform

1005
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,640
to really get you started coding if

1006
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,720
you're done with scratch and maybe you

1007
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,800
just want to start typing some stuff and

1008
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,599
it just focuses on problem solving and

1009
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,599
in the process of problem solving to win

1010
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,480
your levels you're also learning to code

1011
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,359
all right and finally codecademy

1012
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
codecademy is a simple and effective way

1013
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,079
to get your code learning done

1014
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,880
they have many languages um currently

1015
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
what you're looking at here is me trying

1016
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,040
to teach myself javascript

1017
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
they have

1018
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,359
a lesson

1019
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,119
a code editor

1020
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,280
and a terminal on screen

1021
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,359
and you can see there's a short lesson

1022
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,839
this one's on ternary operators

1023
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,280
blah blah blah when you look at the

1024
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,800
lesson

1025
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,040
very short very digestible

1026
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,960
then they give you a task

1027
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,200
refactor or edit the first if else block

1028
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
to use a ternary operator here's where

1029
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
we probably go into

1030
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,759
best motion

1031
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,520
[Music]

1032
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,400
now that we have that done i've edited

1033
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,200
it

1034
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,879
we can hit run and see if it worked

1035
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
correct i love that okay and if you look

1036
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,839
here look ta-da little green check mark

1037
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,000
i have succeeded in this task not only

1038
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,599
that look down here four days left to

1039
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,920
meet your weekly targets it keeps you

1040
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,000
motivated keeps you on track you can set

1041
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,440
goals for yourself how many times a week

1042
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,680
do you want to code

1043
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,079
and then it gives you the next task

1044
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,520
very simple very elegant very effective

1045
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,800
all right

1046
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,240
so

1047
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,440
however you want to get your coding

1048
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
learning done these are fun ways to get

1049
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,920
yourself motivated to code um

1050
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
choose one or all

1051
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,800
there are so many different things you

1052
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,440
can do and they're very comprehensive

1053
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,280
um here we're gonna start talking about

1054
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,440
crypto challenges and child sites ciao

1055
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,960
of course is just slang for challenge

1056
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
um and what you're looking at here is a

1057
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,839
screenshot of um our how to hack their

1058
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,440
complete list of war games if you want

1059
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
to find this page yourself you just

1060
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,640
google our how to hack complete list of

1061
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
war games

1062
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,359
there are so many of them here this if i

1063
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,920
were able to scroll down a screenshot

1064
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,440
you would just see

1065
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,839
just keep going and going and going um

1066
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,599
and what are they well

1067
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,680
they are websites created by the

1068
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,119
community um and by just you know clubs

1069
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,880
and groups and things designed as fun

1070
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,040
ways to learn some of these infosec

1071
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
concepts they're almost a little bit

1072
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,400
like static ctfs um

1073
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,480
some types of these sites present

1074
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
puzzles and more ctf style challenges

1075
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,680
while others of these sites are more

1076
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
like i'm going to give you some

1077
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,200
vulnerable machines and you try and hack

1078
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
into them

1079
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,280
again notice the little warning here

1080
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,680
chills

1081
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,079
get a hold of yourselves there's so much

1082
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,760
stuff there you've got to just

1083
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
maybe just stick to the four that i

1084
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,000
recommend here um

1085
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,720
so

1086
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,200
the crypto challenges that i recommend

1087
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,800
for jill or alice um for jill you might

1088
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,400
like rank.org and

1089
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,800
newbiecontest.orgrank.org

1090
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
has all kinds of diverse level

1091
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,240
challenges you have to

1092
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,079
get a certain number of challenges right

1093
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,079
to get to the next level the challenges

1094
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,839
themselves level up get a certain number

1095
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,359
get to the next level it's all egyptian

1096
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
themed it's kind of fun

1097
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
um and the kinds of challenges that you

1098
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,880
see on there are

1099
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,839
really

1100
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,359
like everything from just pure

1101
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,200
mathematics to

1102
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,119
um web exploitation to regex

1103
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,160
python i mean just just every info

1104
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
security skill you could think of um

1105
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,000
newbiecontest.org is in french

1106
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,319
but it isn't a problem

1107
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,400
with google translate and as long as you

1108
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,240
understand that when you're looking for

1109
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,040
the uh they call it passwords the

1110
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,319
password

1111
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,640

1112
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,200
pass there you go now you can use newbie

1113
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,359
contest thanks google translate

1114
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,720
real similar setup to rank.org um and

1115
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,079
covering a lot of the topics that you

1116
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,560
would see in something like picoctf

1117
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,280
uh not pron

1118
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,240
is an alice type of experience if you

1119
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,839
haven't done it it bills itself is the

1120
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,520
hardest riddle available on the internet

1121
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
it's been around for a long time

1122
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
um and it starts out real easy and it

1123
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,280
starts out with more like puzzles um

1124
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
you know learning different you know

1125
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,119
classic cryptographies and then just you

1126
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,079
know puzzles of you know

1127
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,160
battle of wits kind of things and then

1128
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,480
it progresses into web exploitation like

1129
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,640
at a certain point they say from now on

1130
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,079
all the puzzles need to be solved by

1131
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,599
looking at the

1132
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,400
um

1133
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,680
source code so it's a great resource to

1134
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,200
dive down a rabbit hole it's got this

1135
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,079
incredibly creepy ambiance and there's

1136
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,760
not really a story behind it but it's

1137
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,119
it's atmospheric and it's really fun um

1138
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,079
and then also for our alistars out there

1139
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,240
who just like a really deep dive we have

1140
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,560
the us cybercom valentine's day crypto

1141
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,079
challenges sort of like sans does the

1142
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,800
holiday hack us cybercom releases

1143
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,200
cryptography challenges and they range

1144
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,040
from fairly easy to ridiculous have to

1145
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,599
write um you have to use matlab or write

1146
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,760
a python or java program to solve them

1147
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,160
kind of challenges um

1148
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
and

1149
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,680
they are like talk about deep dive so

1150
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,760
fun um

1151
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,680
the thing about these challenges is

1152
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,920
unlike some of the other resources that

1153
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,079
i have shown you you might not be able

1154
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,160
to find the answers as easily some of

1155
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,040
them

1156
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,599
are um really try very hard and ask

1157
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,200
their users not to publish things

1158
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,440
because they don't like rank.org people

1159
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
earn their rank and so they don't want

1160
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,400
people just reading the answer and

1161
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,680
putting it in

1162
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,240
um so you really do have to this is this

1163
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,319
is where you don't have the answer key

1164
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,839
you have to work with your friends or do

1165
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,280
your own research and so it makes it

1166
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
really meaningful when you solve one of

1167
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,200
these because you have not had any hints

1168
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,359
it's just wow you figured it out it

1169
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,960
feels so good

1170
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
um here's challenge examples from

1171
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,319
alice's side of the screen

1172
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,800
we have on the that is my left

1173
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,560
um not prawn and you can see from the

1174
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,079
picture it's really um you know there's

1175
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,640
a skull and is that a syringe of fake

1176
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,280
blood and you know

1177
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
there's there's interesting puzzle-like

1178
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,200
things going on here i do not know

1179
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,400
what's going on here because i haven't

1180
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,119
got to level 21 on not pron i just

1181
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,640
nabbed this screenshot off the internet

1182
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,960
but i guarantee there's like five levels

1183
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,680
to this puzzle very fun um

1184
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,200
and on the other side on the right here

1185
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,960
we have one of the valentine's day

1186
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
crypto challenges actually from 2021 i

1187
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,440
think this is puzzle number one

1188
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,920
that ladies and gentlemen is a binary

1189
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,839
cross stitch

1190
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,119
they don't tell you that you have to

1191
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,599
figure that out but um talk about good

1192
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,880
learning like i'm a math teacher i

1193
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,160
understand base two and binary but like

1194
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,040
i learned binary

1195
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,880
doing this and so did my nine-year-old

1196
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,079
incidentally because i needed someone

1197
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,200
who could keep their finger on the

1198
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,480
screen at the last place that i had

1199
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,000
recorded a one or a zero and we started

1200
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
doing it together and then you know

1201
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
started learning about the 64s place and

1202
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,599
you know before we do it we were both

1203
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,400
just

1204
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,800
chugging through that binary

1205
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,440
and then you know converting it to

1206
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,480
uh

1207
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,160
words and things like that to solve the

1208
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,359
puzzle so

1209
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,520
very very fun cool types of challenges

1210
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,720
that's that's one of the easier ones

1211
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,680
some of the other ones are multi-step

1212
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,200
um

1213
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,920
so here are some examples from rank.org

1214
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,319
and newbie contest on the left we have

1215
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,720
uh rank.org i haven't solved this puzzle

1216
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,880
either i just it was a great graphic i

1217
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,160
just took it from their site it's one of

1218
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,839
the ones i'm still working on

1219
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,680
something about it probably has to do

1220
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,200
with colors something about the name is

1221
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,240
something about the colors so i'm

1222
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,359
thinking i'm going to have to use like a

1223
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,520
color picker to figure out which one of

1224
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,760
those letters has like a hex color

1225
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,079
that's like slightly different and

1226
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,760
that's going to give me the answer not

1227
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
sure

1228
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,839
and then newbie contest over there you

1229
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,280
can see le francaise again

1230
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,599
the password

1231
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,880
the password a there you go so

1232
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,400
uh don't need to know french to do

1233
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,119
newbie contest this was just a file that

1234
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,599
no explanation find the password

1235
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,520
pop that into a hex editor lo and behold

1236
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,200
so you're learning to use the tools

1237
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,599
you've got to try to find hidden content

1238
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,079
and find the places that data is stored

1239
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,079
and again goes from beginner all the way

1240
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,200
up to more challenging

1241
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,640
all right so

1242
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,720
let's talk about projects because they

1243
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,599
are

1244
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
real important especially down there

1245
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,040
even though i didn't put it all the way

1246
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,200
to the left the way we read

1247
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,240
your blog

1248
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,960
um blogs are super important for anyone

1249
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,200
who like me does not have a technical

1250
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,119
resume um i've been in the classroom for

1251
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,079
17 years so how does anyone know what i

1252
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,720
can do well a tech blog

1253
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,680
you can write about write-ups of ctfs

1254
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,200
you can do write-ups of crypto

1255
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
challenges i have some of those on there

1256
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
uh you can do a learning summary like

1257
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,560
let's say you really understand

1258
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
subnetting and you want to explain it to

1259
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,319
people um

1260
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,720
and you know it's just a great resource

1261
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,240
and then you can put it on your resume

1262
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,920
and people can go and look and say oh

1263
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,119
look

1264
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,720
they take the time they do the tech

1265
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,800
there you can it's a great way to show

1266
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,240
people how you think

1267
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,599
um

1268
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,200
coding projects which also by the way

1269
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,400
can be put on your blog um just some

1270
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
there's so many coding like if you just

1271
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,720
google newbie coding projects there are

1272
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,040
so many out there so many ideas for

1273
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,000
example

1274
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,760
write a program that translates plain

1275
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,440
text into simple encodings and it

1276
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,839
depends on you know the simple encodings

1277
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,440
can get more complex mathematically the

1278
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,400
longer you go um or you know a basic one

1279
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,920
write a calculator

1280
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,760
and then get more complex as you go and

1281
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,680
then these projects are something you

1282
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,880
can share

1283
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,000
um

1284
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,400
when i say home lab i don't mean in the

1285
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
middle of this chip short go buy

1286
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,640
yourself a server off of some government

1287
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,520
auction site and then like try and

1288
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,040
nope just

1289
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,200
vmware or

1290
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,440
you know other other hypervisor of your

1291
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,319
choice

1292
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,200
um

1293
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,680
and then set up some vulnerable machines

1294
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,839
on vuln hub and try to hack them you

1295
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,440
know uh

1296
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
practice networking

1297
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,079
so great great project for you to have

1298
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,440
and something you can talk about in an

1299
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,680
interview um and a raspberry pi hole is

1300
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,760
one of my perfectly favorite perfect

1301
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,240
projects because it blocks all the ads

1302
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,599
all the ads i surf my my phone like the

1303
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,200
web on my phone and

1304
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,359
i don't have any ads

1305
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,960
so it teaches you how to um you know set

1306
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,319
up a dns server in your house and it

1307
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,599
helps you work with your own network

1308
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,760
your own home network and it's really

1309
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,119
fun and then of course you have to tweak

1310
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,720
it and troubleshooting is all part of

1311
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,520
the plan so great learning projects

1312
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,839
things to get under your

1313
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,079
belt let's talk family time

1314
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,599
um

1315
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,160
if you are an alice you

1316
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,960
or sorry a jill jill of all trades there

1317
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,359
you might love doing scratch scratch

1318
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,559
junior or even code combat um with your

1319
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,880
kids and i don't just mean like little

1320
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,640
kids although i do also mean little kids

1321
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,319
because scratch junior is designed for

1322
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,079
pre-k you know kids who can't read yet

1323
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,960
can do scratch junior and it is free

1324
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
um

1325
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,359
so fun to collaborate with them and work

1326
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,440
together on projects and then you're

1327
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,119
doing your learning

1328
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,640
and they're going to be like why don't

1329
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,920
we do this and you like never would have

1330
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,040
thought of doing that and now you have

1331
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
to solve this problem of how do we do a

1332
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,960
program that does that it's great kids

1333
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,520
are great impossible idea generators

1334
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,760
um if you are an alice you might like a

1335
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,599
crypto treasure hunt or if you have

1336
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,920
alice's in your house um where you write

1337
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,520
outs you just like i don't know hide

1338
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,800
brandon couple pieces of chocolate

1339
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,559
around the house and then write out

1340
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,960
something in code

1341
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,480
and then hide the next clue and the next

1342
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,079
clue and so forth you're practicing some

1343
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,920
of your cryptography and they're

1344
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,599
practicing cryptography and everybody's

1345
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,720
having fun because in the end there's

1346
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,000
chocolate

1347
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,200
um and then if you have whoever you are

1348
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,720
a middle through high school student in

1349
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,240
your house your middle through high

1350
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,160
school student is allowed to sign up for

1351
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,960
cyber start america for free it is run

1352
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,839
by sans it is a platform that teaches

1353
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,040
hacking in a way that is super gamified

1354
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,640
fun art fun scenarios um and because it

1355
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,160
sans you know it's excellent it's kind

1356
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,839
of like net wars junior but with like

1357
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,119
better art i don't even know how to

1358
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,720
describe it it's amazing and of course

1359
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,920
if you have someone in your house that

1360
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,280
is that age

1361
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,640
you can work on it together

1362
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,240
all right

1363
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,680
wrong way

1364
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,720
so

1365
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,240
anyway this is the grand resource list

1366
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,280
um

1367
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,400
i am going to be posting these slides on

1368
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,680
my blog

1369
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,480
at the end so that um

1370
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,720
you know obviously nobody can write that

1371
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
fast if you're interested i hope that

1372
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,520
you use this as a resource i hope that

1373

blog and finish up the challenge if you

1377
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,720
do i have several copies of backdoors

1378
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,720
and breaches that i will absolutely send

1379
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,319

it was amazing yes it is um if you want

1427
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,960
to have real fun with piehole set it up

1428
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,559
in a a small kubernetes cluster on um

1429
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,559
raspberry pis

1430
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,280
um

1431
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,520
and then you can balance out all sorts

1432
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,000
of other things on there too besides

1433
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,079
just pie hole and it's actually pretty

1434
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,599
easy to set up

1435
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,640
but um i know i have one right here

1436

i'm writing this down oh yeah yeah um

1437
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,720
but don't use full kubernetes use k3s

1438
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,800
from rancher and it's very easy to set

1439
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,319
up

1440
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,640

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,040
doing challenges and puzzles and

1464
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,880
so uh if you want a free copy of

1465
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,800
backdoors and breaches last time i did a

1466
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,640
talk

1467
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,240
the per the first person that solved it

1468
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,640
was a 12 year old girl who was super

1469
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,160
into infosec and it was very exciting

1470
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,359
and i sent her a copy with a bunch of

1471
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,480
stickers i have a bunch of stickers too

1472
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,079
you get stickers so

1473
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,640
that is fabulous um

1474
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,680
yeah

1475
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,800
this just goes to show that your major

1476
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,480
does not have to be computer science to

1477
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,520
be really good and get into this stuff i

1478
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,400
saw several other people post that they

1479
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,720
too were music majors which i was jazz

1480
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,680
composition what about music and math

1481
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,760
yeah

1482
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,200
um so

1483
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,599
and i guess well i'm very syncopated

1484
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,200
being a jazz drummer so maybe that has

1485
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,558
something to do with math huh

1486
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,240
anyway

1487
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,720
