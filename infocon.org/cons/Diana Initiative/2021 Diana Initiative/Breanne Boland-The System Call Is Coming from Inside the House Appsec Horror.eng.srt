hi and welcome to stage three

2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,160
i hope you're enjoying the conference uh

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
if you get a chance stop by the expo

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
booth so you can visit some of the

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
sponsors and you can visit the villages

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
by going to sessions

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
so i'm super excited to welcome brianne

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,119
to the stage

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,359
brienne was most recently an enterprise

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,079
security engineer after several years as

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,960
an sre and infrastructure engineer

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
in august she'll be starting a new job

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
doing security partnerships on a project

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,600
team

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,239
brands talk is the system call is coming

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,920
from inside the house

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
appsec horror stories

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
awesome i will get my my slide shared

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,559
and we'll get it going

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
all right scoot this over and get

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
started all right well hello good

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
afternoon diana initiative my name is

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,240
brianne boland and i

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
am as mentioned was recently enterprise

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
an enterprise security engineer and i'm

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
here to talk to you about absec horror

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
stories

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
so like ghosts security vulnerabilities

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,159
are the result of us going about our

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,400
lives doing the best we can and then

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
experiencing things going awry as you

32
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,320
know usually happens

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
we plan systems we build software we try

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,119
to create the best teams we can and yet

35
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,479
there will always be echoes in the world

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
from our sub-optimal choices

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,000
those choices can come from lots of

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
places one team member's work isn't

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,119
double checked when there's a large

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,640
decision at stake

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
a committee losing the thread or worst

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,360
of all

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
absolutely nothing out of the ordinary

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
that's right security issues are a

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
natural side effect of creating and

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
using technology

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
today though we're going to talk about

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
the energy signatures cryptids orbs

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,200
poltergeist strange sounds code smells

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
and things that go bump in the night

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,239
that's right we're talking about

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,598
security horror stories get your

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,720
flashlight and i'll meet you by the

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
campfire

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,720
buddy there it is

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,239
before we get started a little

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,080
disclaimer uh everything that i'm about

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,120
to talk about is something that i've

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
encountered but with a few pretty clear

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
uh exceptions i put a light veil of

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
fiction over everything it's just

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,000
professionalism and good manners with a

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
little dash of superstition

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
i believe the universe often enough

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,959
likes to punish arrogance so i'm not

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,640
pretending i'm only into any of this no

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,238
one is and it's why apsec exists

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
well let's get to the haunts

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
our first monster

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
automatic updates i'm starting with this

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,879
one because it's the one that's probably

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
most fresh in everyone's minds and i'm

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,160
mentioning it first also because it's

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,239
such a dramatic betrayal when it happens

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
you think you're doing the right thing

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,319
you're doing the thing that your

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
security team told you to do and then

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
suddenly you hear a familiar name in the

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
news and you have an incident on your

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
hands

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
the monster i would compare it to

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,959
it's like getting stabbed with your own

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,879
stake when you're fending off a vampire

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
i thought we had a good thing going we

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
usually do but then suddenly

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
and how you identify it

87
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,440
ideally it's by responsible disclosure

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
from the company but realistically

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,080
it might be cnn such as the way of

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
supply chain attacks

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,400
and we invite it in uh by doing the

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
right thing because using components

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,000
tools and libraries with known

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
vulnerabilities is in the most current

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
version of the owasp top 10 for a reason

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,680
this problem comes from the tricky

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
balance of keeping everything updated

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
it's the old ops versus security

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,599
argument

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,200
i'll tell you a story about this once

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,959
upon a time a couple jobs ago we were

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,239
suddenly having trouble with some

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,400
servers that had just been updated

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
ansible which we used for server

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
orchestration was behaving itself but

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
things weren't working right after the

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
hourly update

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
following an intense afternoon some of

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
my coworkers narrowed it down to a

110
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
single dependency that hadn't been

111
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
updated or had suddenly been updated

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,720
after a long time with no releases

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,840
it wasn't even what you'd call a

114
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
load-bearing library but it was

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
important enough that there had been a

116
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,840
breaking change

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
the problem was solved by pinning the

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
requirement to an earlier version and

119
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
reverting the update

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
and my own sad little contribution

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,880
uh to this not being the state of things

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
forever was to make a ticket in our

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
deepest most frozen ice boxy backlog

124
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
saying that we needed to revisit it in

125
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
six months

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
i was necessary then but i was already

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
leaning towards security and so i was a

128
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
little perturbed by the resolution

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,479
although it was absolutely the best

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,520
thing we could have come up with that

131
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,479
day

132
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,919
it did get fixed later by the way my

133
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
co-workers were nice enough to tell me

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
this has become one of those stories

135
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,160
that doesn't precisely haunt me but it

136
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,560
stays with me when i review code or look

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
at a web ui and i come up with an old

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
version of a server software or another

139
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
dependency

140
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
even if it doesn't have a documented

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
vulnerability not throwing the parking

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
brake on until that whatever it is has

143
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
been updated to the most major version

144
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,919
feels like doing badly by our future

145
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,199
selves

146
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
the best way to fix this one

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
is to pay attention to changes check

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
hashes on new packages and generally pay

149
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
very close attention to what's flowing

150
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
into your environment

151
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
it isn't easy but it's what we've got

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
our next ghost

153
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,919
horrors that lurk and free software

154
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
the monster i would compare it to is

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
bringing a ouija board into the house

156
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
that you found on the street

157
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
and i'm gonna pause here for just a

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
second because to be honest this is my

159
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,039
favorite illustration i made for this

160
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,240
talk so i just want us all to sit with

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
it for a moment

162
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
thank you for your indulgence

163
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
and how do you identify it

164
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,160
listen for yourself saying something

165
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
like oh look at this cool free thing

166
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
thanks captain howdy i feel so much more

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
efficient now

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,440
question everything that's free

169
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,880
especially if it executes on your own

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
computer

171
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
and we invite it in because sometimes

172
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,120
it's just really hard to resist

173
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
something that's free and useful

174
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
sometimes even if you know better

175
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,560
and it gets really interesting because

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,919
there's a particular problem with chrome

177
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,280
extensions which is that you can't

178
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
officially publish them

179
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
unless automatic updates are enabled so

180
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
if someone has if you've installed

181
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
something as long as it's there someone

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
on the outside has a direct line to

183
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
change the code in your browser

184
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
uh last fall the great suspender which

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
was a pretty popular extension that

186
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
suspended tabs and reduced uh chrome

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
sometimes formidable use of memory it

188
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
got taken over by malicious maintainers

189
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,479
and people who had once upon a time done

190
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,759
maybe done their due diligence were

191
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,440
suddenly very unpleasantly surprised on

192
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,520
what was running on their machines

193
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
and that's the tough thing about

194
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
evaluating some of these you have to

195
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
consider both the current risks which is

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
permissions used things lurking in code

197
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
and then possible future risks

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,240
what happens if this program's installed

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
on 500 computers that all have access to

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,600
your company's shared drive and then

201
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
suddenly that extension goes rogue

202
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,520
it makes it difficult to be something

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
other than that stereotype of security

204
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
the endless purveyors of no

205
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,199
but a small risk across a big enough

206
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,720
attack surface ends up being a much

207
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
larger risk

208
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
in short it's the facebook principle

209
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
where if you get a service for free you

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
might consider the possibility you're

211
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
actually the product

212
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,560
security isn't necessarily handled as

213
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,919
carefully as it should be for the

214
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
product as it is for paying customers

215
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,680
pick your conveniences carefully and

216
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,039
make a point of pruning them now and

217
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,560
then or

218
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,919
if you're in the excellent position of

219
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,280
controlling something like this for your

220
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
company consider moving to an allow list

221
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
model instead of a block list make

222
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
conveniences prove themselves before you

223
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,799
bring them inside the house

224
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,880
the next thing that goes bump in the

225
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,080
night

226
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
overly verbose stack traces

227
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
i quote william peter blatty eminent

228
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
epsec engineer and author of the

229
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
exorcist the demon is a liar he will lie

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,759
to confuse us but he will also mix lies

231
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,840
with the truth to attack us

232
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
the monster here

233
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
logs and stack cases contain the truth

234
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
right they're there to collect context

235
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,319
and provide you information to make

236
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
things better logs they're amazing right

237
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
except

238
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,720
when they get out of their cage

239
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,319
or when they can contain information

240
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,599
that can be used to hurt you or your

241
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,280
users

242
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
you invite it in by adding values to

243
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
debug statements that really don't need

244
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,919
to be there

245
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
or

246
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,560
writing endpoints that end up having

247
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
errors that spill big old stack traces

248
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
and tell on you

249
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,879
maybe you leave debugging mode on

250
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,199
anywhere once the code has been deployed

251
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
or maybe you just haven't read up on o

252
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,240
wasp's cheat sheet on security

253
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
misconfiguration

254
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
how do you fend it off

255
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,319
work to conjure a good culturally shared

256
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,720
idea of safe log construction and also

257
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
remember what shouldn't be in logs or

258
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
errors that include secrets pii phi

259
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
anything that could hurt your users and

260
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
anything that could get you sued

261
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,000
and also just make a commit hook that

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
checks for debug anything

263
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
our next scary thing api keys and other

264
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,919
secrets in code

265
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,760
i quote the greater slickhay legwind

266
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,080
speak the name as to control the thing

267
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,839
and for that reason i would compare this

268
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
particular problem to the fey or

269
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
possibly wizards knowing your name and

270
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,880
being able to control you

271
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
you can identify it by reading your code

272
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
is there something in there that you

273
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
wouldn't want just any old person to see

274
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,519
yank it

275
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
use less sensitive identifiers like

276
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
internal account numbers if you need to

277
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
just not the thing that lets someone

278
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
pretend to be either you or your users

279
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,519
if they have it

280
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,720
and the way that you invite it in and

281
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
this is unfortunately common

282
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
listen for someone saying oh it's a

283
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
private repo it'll never matter or oh

284
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
it's a key that's not a big deal it's

285
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,880
fine if it's out there

286
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,760
you fend it off with safe secret storage

287
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
and not depending on github is your only

288
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
layer of security for this kind of thing

289
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
because look we all want to do it

290
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,640
sometimes it's way easier than dealing

291
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
with environment variables or you know

292
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
setting up a secret storage system

293
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,640
who wants to spend time caring for and

294
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
feeding a vault cluster come on it's

295
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
just in our servers it's not a big deal

296
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,760
it's only deployed within our private

297
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,680
network

298
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,000
i'm here to tell you it is a big deal it

299
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
is my job to tell people not to do this

300
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,120
and today i will tell you for almost

301
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
free don't do this

302
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,560
and i've had to argue with people about

303
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
this before and i'm sure i will again

304
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
it surprises me every time but the thing

305
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
is people just want to get their work

306
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,120
done

307
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,480
as a security professional it becomes

308
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
your job to help them understand that

309
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,640
saving time right now can become so time

310
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
consuming later on

311
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
to solve this it's great to have a

312
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
commit check that looks for secrets even

313
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
better is having a cultural com a

314
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,079
cultural competency of never doing this

315
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
but best of all is both

316
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
our next monster

317
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
a single layer of input validation for

318
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
your web ui for this one i quote

319
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
zombieland always double tap

320
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
the monster i compare it to is anything

321
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,959
tenacious think zombies vampires hydras

322
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
anything that travels in the pack just

323
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
look at those heads that is a tenacious

324
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
beast

325
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
and you can identify this problem by

326
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
sticking burp sweet on your site maybe

327
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
the form doesn't let you put a little

328
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,560
script tag in it but the http request

329
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
might be only too happy to oblige

330
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
and the way that we invite it in

331
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
well it can be by being complacent or

332
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
being rushed or both

333
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
we fend it off by remembering that

334
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
regular users aren't a real threat and

335
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,399
probably if you're just doing some

336
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,120
overly zealous input validation

337
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
uh you're probably just annoying your

338
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
users and at worst um creating a really

339
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
racist problem for people with names

340
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
that it's decided not to consider normal

341
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
but there's a reason injection

342
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,720
especially sql injection is a perennial

343
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,959
member of the oasp top 10. so say it

344
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
with me client side and server side

345
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,519
validation and sanitation and then

346
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,640
depending on what you're doing with that

347
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,680
text add appropriate encoding to

348
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,279
most people do only interact with your

349
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
server server be your front end and you

350
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
know what bless them but you know what

351
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
the world is filled with jerks like me

352
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
both professional jerks and people who

353
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
are jerks for fun and we will say hey

354
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,839
directly to your server

355
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,440
never take only one measure when you can

356
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,839
take two

357
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,959
our next scary thing

358
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
technology that will never leave us

359
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
think ancient wordpress

360
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
old versions of windows running on

361
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,519
untold number of servers right now

362
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,279
a certain outdated version of gunnacorn

363
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,480
and then other

364
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,920
other software with published cves

365
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
as for the monster i'd compare it to

366
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,160
well

367
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
i'm not going to say his name am i

368
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
we identify it by listening for the

369
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
phrase legacy software although newer

370
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
projects are absolutely not immune to

371
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,120
this

372
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
and we invited in by we invited in by

373
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
saying something like oh we're really

374
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,040
focusing our budget and time on new

375
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
features right now and things like that

376
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
and the best way to fend it off is

377
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,040
allocate budget to keep your stuff

378
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,079
updated

379
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,719
seriously

380
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,360
the thing to remember uh no tool

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
framework or language is bad

382
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
all of them have issues that need to be

383
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
considered when you're using them for

384
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,079
instance there are still valid reasons

385
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,560
to use xml and php is a legitimate

386
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,079
programming language that just needs to

387
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
be lovingly tended

388
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
yes we're back at the risk of using

389
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,959
components with no vulnerabilities in

390
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,800
them

391
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
uh and

392
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,040
with no

393
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
vulnerabilities from the os top 10 but

394
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,519
no tool framework or language is bad

395
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
and some versions have some known

396
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
problems and some tools have common

397
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,560
issues if you don't work around them use

398
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,839
them mindfully

399
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,440
it's not on them it's on you and how you

400
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
use and tend your tools

401
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
the real incantation to keep this one

402
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
away is understanding why we keep these

403
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
things around

404
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
no engineering team keeps their resident

405
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,920
technical debt nightmare because they

406
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
like it they keep it around because it's

407
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,519
worked and rewriting things is expensive

408
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,360
and finicky especially if outside

409
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
entities depend on your software or

410
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
services

411
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
i've never been on an engineering team

412
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
that didn't have lots of other things to

413
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,079
do rather than address the thing that

414
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
mostly hasn't given them problems

415
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,320
even if none of the engineers without

416
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,920
vivid memories of the 90s actually

417
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
understand what it does

418
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,120
sometimes the risk of breaking changes

419
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
is scarier than whatever might be

420
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
waiting down the road once your old

421
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,519
dependencies cause problems

422
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,519
or worst of all someone on the outside

423
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
realizes what your stuff depends on

424
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
speaking of no tool framework or

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
language being bad let's talk about

426
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,680
javascript or specifically javascript

427
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,079
being used incorrectly

428
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
the monster i compare it to is anything

429
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,399
where oh my god it's gone airborne or oh

430
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
my god it's in the water the little 12

431
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
monkeys a little cabin fever

432
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,160
oh god it's everywhere it's unavoidable

433
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,440
it's a

434
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,320
global pandemic

435
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
how do you invite it in

436
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
via the internet anything internet it'll

437
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
be there whether you think it's there or

438
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,800
not

439
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
how to fend it off

440
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
just be very careful please

441
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,639
i'm not going to make fun of javascript

442
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,079
once i was a child and i enjoyed

443
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,440
childish things like making fun of

444
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
javascript

445
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
but that was like three years ago and

446
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
now i'm an adult and i've quit my

447
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,079
childish ways or at least i made myself

448
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,760
do it uh somewhere between when i

449
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,199
realized that mocking other people's

450
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,639
tech is not actually an interesting

451
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,560
contribution to a conversation

452
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,079
and when i became an abstract engineer

453
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,760
myself so roughly between 2016 and the

454
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
end of 2019 but the point is the

455
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
internet and thus life and commerce as

456
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
we know it runs largely on javascript

457
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
and its various frameworks it's just

458
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
there

459
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,519
and there have been lots of leaps

460
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
forward to make it less nightmarish

461
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
thanks to a lot of really hard work from

462
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
a lot of people

463
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,440
and yet things like doctor's

464
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
appointments and vaccination slots and

465
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,480
other giant matters of safety and

466
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
well-being sit upon the peculiarities of

467
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
a programming language that was written

468
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,399
initially in 10 days

469
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
and unfortunately new dragons are just

470
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
going to continue to appear because

471
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,199
that's the side effect of making things

472
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,880
new features new problems

473
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
the great thing about appsec that's an

474
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
unfortunate thing about humanity is that

475
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,519
we make the same mistakes over and over

476
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,880
because if something worked once we want

477
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,560
to think we have it sorted and

478
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
unfortunately the internet and

479
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
technology insist on continuing to

480
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
evolve

481
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,959
so how do you fix it

482
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,560
invest in apsec

483
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
sorry

484
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
it is a great and i would say critical

485
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,279
goal to develop security conscious

486
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,880
software engineers and to talk security

487
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
as early as possible in the development

488
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,360
process

489
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,639
but there's a reason that writers don't

490
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,920
proofread their own work or at least

491
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
they shouldn't

492
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
writing and reviewing the work are two

493
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,759
different jobs it's why healthy

494
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,440
companies don't let people prove their

495
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,600
own pr's if we created it we can't see

496
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,759
it objectively and most of us become

497
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,279
sharper when honed by other perspectives

498
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,839
and ideas

499
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,800
now for our last last haunt

500
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
possibly my favorite

501
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,279
excessive permissions uh especially aws

502
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,959
which to me brings us right back to

503
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,560
where we started

504
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
because the monster i'd compare it to is

505
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
sleeping unprotected in the woods when

506
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
you know they're full of threats

507
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,279
and you can identify it by checking out

508
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,360
your iam role permissions and yes this

509
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,040
is totally a broken authentication issue

510
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,959
to a la o wasp

511
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,199
and the best way i know to invite it in

512
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
is to start out as a smaller shop like

513
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,279
say three engineers who do everything

514
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,720
and they all work together in the same

515
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
room maybe and they go out to lunch and

516
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
they all know what everyone else is

517
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,560
doing but then it grows and suddenly of

518
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
30 engineers are 50 or more and

519
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
everyone's becoming more specialized

520
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
but your roles and permissions never got

521
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
the memo

522
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,920
to send it off

523
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,839
make different roles early

524
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,600
and i know it's hard it isn't a change

525
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,199
that enables a feature earns more money

526
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,639
and worst of all

527
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
as you refine the roles reduce access

528
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
and iterate you're probably going to

529
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
piss off a bunch of people as you work

530
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,360
to get it right

531
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
i am it's the monster that doesn't

532
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,160
actually need a clever analogy because

533
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
getting it right sucks so bad on its own

534
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
it's also the monster that lurks around

535
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
basically every corner because i am is

536
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
ubiquitous

537
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,800
so it's everywhere and it's endlessly

538
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
difficult awesome

539
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,160
but we have to put the work in because

540
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,839
messing it up is the best way i know to

541
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
undermine so much other super careful

542
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,199
security work

543
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
here let's look the beast right in its

544
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,079
face

545
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,880
ah

546
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
yeah i feel warmly toward it because i

547
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
am was my gateway into security work and

548
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,919
it's the thing that i still quietly

549
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,439
recommend to people who are aspiring to

550
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,199
be security professionals because a lot

551
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,319
of people

552
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
just don't like doing it very much but

553
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
the work always needs to be done

554
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
so just showing up and being like oh i

555
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
am i'd love to

556
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,280
it's a highly distinctive professional

557
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
posture

558
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
so get your crucifix ready and have some

559
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
incantations at hand and you'll never

560
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
run out of things to do it is never not

561
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,799
useful

562
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,000
it's just like the rest of tech if

563
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,039
you're willing to do the grunt work and

564
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,720
get good at it you'll probably have work

565
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
for as long as you want it

566
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,360
it's a lot of things that go bump in the

567
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,160
night let's end with something positive

568
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
i want to leave you with some good

569
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,559
general strategies for your

570
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,600
vulnerability ghost hunting

571
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,799
first

572
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,720
work to be easy to work with and this

573
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,160
doesn't mean being in a perpetually good

574
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
mood i assure you i am not and previous

575
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
co-workers can and probably will attest

576
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,080
to this if you ask them

577
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
but it does mean reliably not killing

578
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
the messenger

579
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
people outside of your security team

580
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,919
including and especially people who

581
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,600
aren't engineers

582
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,280
are your best resource for actually

583
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
knowing what's going on

584
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
and here's the thing

585
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
if you're a security engineer people

586
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,679
don't act completely normally around you

587
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
anymore you probably don't get the full

588
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
spectrum of people's natural behavior

589
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,039
unfortunately it just comes with the

590
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,799
territory and it means we have to rely

591
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,240
on people telling us the truth when they

592
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
see something concerning

593
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,000
even people who are cooperative with us

594
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
will hedge a little bit when it comes to

595
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
dealing with us and i know this because

596
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,919
i've done it

597
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
but you'll reduce this if everyone knows

598
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
that talking to security will be an easy

599
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
gracious thing where they're thanked at

600
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,080
the end

601
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
make awards for people who are willing

602
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,120
to bring you problems instead of

603
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,559
creating a culture of fear and covering

604
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,559
things up make people feel like they're

605
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,240
an ally and a valued resource because

606
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,960
they are

607
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
and next

608
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
okay i kid but seriously

609
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,679
being able to communicate in writing is

610
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,600
so important to this work whether it's

611
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
vulnerability reports responsible

612
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
disclosure blog posts about haunted

613
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,960
terrain or just corresponding with

614
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
people affected by security poltergeists

615
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,320
being able to write clearly for a

616
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
variety of audiences is one of our best

617
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,360
tools

618
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
if you think you're losing your grip on

619
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
how regular people talk about the stuff

620
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
bribe your best blunt non-technical

621
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
friend explain things to them have them

622
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,679
tell you don't make sense and then try

623
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,440
again until it works

624
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
you want to be able to explain things in

625
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
language with motivations that make

626
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
sense to them

627
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,559
in conclusion i hope you encounter none

628
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,760
of these terrifying creatures and

629
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,840
phenomena that i described that your

630
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,520
trails from server to server in our

631
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
increasingly connected world are paved

632
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,799
with only good intentions and mortared

633
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
together with only the best outcomes

634
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,919
but

635
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,360
should you wander into dark woods full

636
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
of glowing red eyes and skittering

637
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
sounds belonging to creatures just out

638
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,919
of sight i hope you're better equipped

639
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,200
to recognize and banish them than you

640
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,320
were earlier

641
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,799
