hello

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,439
my name is maggie mayhem

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,240
and it is my pleasure to be here today

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,759
for the diana initiative 2022.

29
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,159
it has been my honor and my privilege to

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,439
work with some of the people who made

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,040
this conference possible in many

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
capacities

33
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
i've been able to talk about sex worker

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,520
rights harm reduction and other causes

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
that are near and dear to my heart

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
when i received the invitation to be

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
here today however

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
i initially wanted to run away because

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
how could i be the right person for this

40
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,920
conference

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,720
i don't know anything about how to break

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
into information security or any

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,879
technical workplace i don't know how to

44
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,520
even get a job

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
i've been making my living as

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
someone engaged in the erotic trades or

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
in birth work and even death work and i

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
can tell you a little bit about that but

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
certainly not how to get a job in

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
silicon valley or any other place that

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
works with technology

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
i don't know how to pick locks

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
i don't know how to capture the flag

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
i can barely open my own email

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,839
successfully

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
what could i have to offer to the people

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
here at this conference today

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
especially when i am in the company of

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
so many experts who have so many things

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
they can share about how to access these

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
jobs and survive and support the people

62
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,840
that you work with when you're there

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
what i can offer

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
is a reminder of the power

65
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
of your imagination

66
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
and your capacity to take initiative on

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,400
behalf of your own imagination in any

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
workplace that you enter no matter what

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,238
it is and no matter what you do

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
i can tell you about the relationship

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
that i've had to work into labor and how

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,000
that has changed over the years

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
while i don't have a roadmap

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
for how to get into a workplace or what

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,280
you might do exactly when you're there

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
i can remind you of the importance of

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,879
you being there

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,040
and the importance of you remembering

79
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
that you are a human when you are there

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
the theme of taking initiative

81
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
is something that i can speak to in a

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
few ways

83
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
and that i'm happy to speak to in a few

84
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,080
ways because that's the kind of phrase

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
that we might hear

86
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,840
that can help us remain the status quo

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
that isn't serving us

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
to say take initiative

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
implies taking action but on behalf of

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
what

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
what do we need to take initiative to do

92
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
what i would like to suggest is

93
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
we should all be taking initiative for

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
our own imagination

95
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,280
and for the awareness of the way that

96
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
the circumstances we face

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
might be foreclosing or limiting that

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,400
imagination

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,720
these times call for a lot

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,960
they call for a lot from us and from our

101
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
communities

102
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,639
it's okay

103
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
to feel a little bit of fear or

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,199
uncertainty in destabilized times

105
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,639
people don't get through it because

106
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,320
they're fearless

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,120
people get through these periods of time

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,080
because they have the capacity to ground

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
themselves in who they are

110
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,080
and what they want to accomplish

111
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,240
many people here are technically

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
proficient and can remember

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,520
the way in which programming allows us

114
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,639
to start

115
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,360
at a command line prompt

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,639
one that is

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,240
unlimited in so many ways

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
when we are interfacing with something

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
that presents itself like a wissy wig

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
what you see is what you get

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
that can limit our imagination

122
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,880
because it tells us that what is

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,919
possible

124
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,919
is what we see in front of us on the

125
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,880
screen

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
and nothing else

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
the truth is

128
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,199
there's so much more that we can do

129
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,240
what is possible is not limited by what

130
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
we can see

131
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,720
what is possible is what we can imagine

132
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
and work together to build and make

133
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
possible

134
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
and it's important to remember that it

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
is important to remember to take

136
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
initiative

137
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
for protecting that imagination and

138
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,880
protecting that field of possibility to

139
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
make sure that we can build the kind of

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,280
world that everybody can live in

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,638
fully as a human being

142
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,280
we must take initiative

143
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,199
to remain human

144
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
and to see the humanity of the people

145
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
that we are working with at all times

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
human beings are more than their market

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,039
value

148
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,360
we all are each and every single one of

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
us

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
it's very likely though that we are

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
receiving messages that tell us that

152
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
we're not

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
that our

154
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
worth that our value

155
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,120
is based on what can be extracted by

156
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
someone who has power

157
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,840
when you go into the workplace

158
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
what you might be told is that you are

159
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,479
on company time

160
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,720
i am asking you today to take the

161
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
initiative to remember that there is no

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,759
such thing as company time

163
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,360
it is your time

164
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
it is our time

165
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,039
and though our workplaces may be able to

166
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,360
place constraints on what we do at that

167
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,319
time

168
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
it is not theirs it is ours

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
every employment contract is one in

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
which we are trading

171
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,919
a bit of our time

172
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,720
for some resources that we need to build

173
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
the best quality of life for ourselves

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
possible

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
that is what a workplace

176
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
is

177
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
as i mentioned before

178
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,440
i don't work in the tech profession

179
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
and i don't have any tips or tricks on

180
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
how to break in

181
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
most of my resources have been obtained

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
through what can be best summarized as

183
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
petty criminal acts

184
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
i'm a criminal

185
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
i'm a former sex worker

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
i'm a full spectrum doula someone who

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
has provided care for any possible

188
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
outcome of a pregnancy including

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
abortion which is being challenged in

190
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
our country

191
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
at this time

192
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,919
i'm someone who's worked in harm

193
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,599
reduction who has been willing to access

194
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,720
and share resources to help people

195
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,039
pursue any positive change in their life

196
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
regardless of their sobriety

197
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
and regardless

198
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
of

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,919
what other challenges and

200
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
marginalization they may be facing

201
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,960
sometimes there's been a law in my way

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,159
never let that stop me

203
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,599
our workplaces

204
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,599
aren't going to be the places that we

205
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,559
find the best tools for our liberation

206
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,440
and for our full humanity

207
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
our workplaces are the places that we

208
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,839
find the resources that we need

209
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
to do something powerful with our

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,279
humanity and with our gifts

211
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,800
to say that it is important for us to

212
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
check our privilege

213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,200
is a chance for us to take inventory of

214
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
our proximity to power

215
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
and fully consider what is possible and

216
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,680
what can be accomplished with it

217
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
what we are facing is unique to our time

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
into our context

219
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
but the situation itself is not

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
unprecedented nor are the tools

221
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
necessary to overcome it

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,920
all resistance movements have been

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,120
predicated upon a population that has a

224
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
consciousness of resistance built in

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,519
that allows them

226
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
to see a moment and act on behalf of

227
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
their values and their shared humanity

228
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,720
to understand that the freedom of all

229
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,480
is where we find our own freedom

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,399
our fates are intertwined with one

231
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,600
another throughout history there have

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,760
been times when people have come to

233
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,080
power and have used it in violent and

234
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
abusive ways to meet their own ends

235
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,079
and every time in history that this has

236
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,959
happened it has been met by a group of

237
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
people not just one person who was

238
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
fearless or heroic

239
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
but people who were ready and willing to

240
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,560
act when a situation called upon them to

241
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
do so

242
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,079
when we take initiative for our

243
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,680
imagination we can meet these moments

244
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
with a sense of empowerment that reminds

245
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,399
us that no matter what we're facing

246
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
we have choices before us

247
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,200
we are not

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,640
fully condemned to subordination or

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
submission

250
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,760
to these unjust power structures

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
especially not when we

252
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,000
take charge of our own imagination

253
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,600
there are people who are going to spend

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
their lives dedicated to underground

255
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
movements many of which that we like to

256
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
create the narrative of resistance or

257
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
rebellion around

258
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
but they have never acted alone and they

259
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,920
have never acted

260
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
as sole actors

261
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,920
as i looked at the recent legislation

262
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
across the united states of america i

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
felt overwhelmed

264
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
this is an overwhelming moment

265
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
and one of the things that i did for

266
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,200
myself was to go and look and read at

267
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
the accounts of people

268
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,079
who survived them and gave us some tips

269
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,880
in their story for what to do

270
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
there are some common themes that exist

271
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
throughout time and space that i think

272
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,720
are very very relevant

273
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
people have been willing

274
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
to take inventory of their potential and

275
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,959
their power

276
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,640
and have been willing to act from where

277
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,040
they stood in their immediate moment

278
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
a consciousness of resistance

279
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,800
is one that allows us to see opportunity

280
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,040
where we might not otherwise if we

281
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
didn't have that imagination

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,839
it allows us to see a moment where we

283
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
can act on behalf of positive change

284
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,480
there's a story that goes back to

285
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
world war ii

286
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,120
and to people who resisting the nazi

287
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
power

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in germany

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
there was an activist who was important

290
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,399
who was an important part of an

291
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
underground resistance movement

292
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,639
and on one day he had a task ahead of

293
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,320
him that was very important for him to

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,519
accomplish

295
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
and he was stopped by a member of the

296
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,839
gestapo

297
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
in that moment he had to decide what he

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
needed to do to survive and he made a

299
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,120
quick improvisational choice

300
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,720
he looked at his surroundings and he

301
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,639
noticed that he was standing beside a

302
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,240
dental office

303
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,760
he looked at the placard on the door and

304
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,399
he said that he was in the midst of

305
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
obtaining absolutely mundane and normal

306
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
dental care

307
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,519
and not up to anything in particular

308
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,040
certainly not an act of resistance

309
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959
that officer knocked on the door of the

310
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,000
dentist

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,040
and out came a person who had never seen

312
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
this individual before they did not know

313
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
each other they did not know the roles

314
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,639
that they played in the world

315
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,120
they had no reason necessarily to trust

316
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,560
one another

317
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
individual the individual who answered

318
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
that door

319
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,240
saw the stakes of that moment

320
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,040
that individual saw the potential threat

321
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
the life or death consequences

322
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
that were at stake

323
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
and rather than saying she didn't know

324
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
that person on the doorstep that there

325
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,320
wasn't

326
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
an appointment on her schedule

327
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,519
which she could have done

328
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,760
instead she took that moment to say

329
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
yes

330
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,199
that was my patient

331
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,279
we were doing some routine dental care

332
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
power sometimes asks us to submit in

333
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
advance before we have to

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
it tells us the consequences we might

335
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
face if we don't act on behalf of that

336
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
power

337
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,399
but we don't always have to

338
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,519
that person didn't have to know

339
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
what was going on they just had to know

340
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,160
that there was a human being whose life

341
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
was in the balance and that there was

342
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
something that they could do to protect

343
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
them

344
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,360
and they made it a point to do so

345
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,880
that person is not going to be someone

346
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,839
that we're going to read about

347
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
necessarily in history books the same

348
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
way that small act was so small it was

349
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
so incidental in the grand scheme of

350
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
things

351
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,040
but

352
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
it was very very important

353
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,519
and that person might not have seen that

354
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,600
moment and their potential to save a

355
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,480
life

356
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
without that imagination and without

357
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,000
awareness and without that

358
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
full conviction of the power they had to

359
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
make a choice that affirmed the humanity

360
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,920
of another human being

361
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
most of what we will be doing in the

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,320
coming years is going to look like that

363
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,839
it's not necessarily going to be the

364
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,279
cinematic narrative of someone running

365
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
into a burning building

366
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
it's going to be people who step up

367
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
courageously like that in day-to-day

368
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
life

369
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
there is no set of individual acts or a

370
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,360
road map that i can offer

371
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
instead what i can say is

372
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,199
we must work

373
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,720
to prevent our conversion into fascism

374
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,040
every day that we face it

375
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
that we must learn resistance as a

376
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,480
discipline

377
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,360
and that we must learn it by holding our

378
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,199
vision for the world that we want to

379
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
live in firmly in mind

380
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,920
without capitulating or making any

381
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,160
concessions the limitations that are

382
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
offered by people who are behaving in a

383
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
way that causes harm

384
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,199
in the wake of the roe v wade decision

385
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,880
i've had a number of people who have

386
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
emailed me asking what do we do

387
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
how do i help how do i show up for other

388
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,959
people in the face of something that i

389
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
know is wrong

390
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,320
in the interim

391
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,839
the battle is going to be faced

392
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
primarily in helping people access the

393
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
care that they need

394
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
our short-term political goals

395
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
are going to be care and they will be

396
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,399
loved

397
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
we are going to have to work to face a

398
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,480
very very long battle over many years

399
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
unfolding to change the politics of this

400
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
moment

401
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
but that change will be made by the

402
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,279
individual decisions of care that we

403
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,240
make for one another

404
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,399
what is resistance

405
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
resistance is above all things the

406
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,360
capacity to take action

407
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,920
it's not an identity

408
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
you may have heard the refrain

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
be an accomplice

410
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
not an ally

411
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
and that's a sentence that speaks

412
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,519
directly to the truth of action

413
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,759
ally is an identity that someone can

414
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,440
take but it can so easily degrade into a

415
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,519
passive form of consumption

416
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,839
rather than the capacity to take action

417
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,440
where one stands

418
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,680
with the power and the proximity to

419
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,559
power

420
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,760
and the potential that comes with that

421
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,119
resistance is

422
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,799
the ability to act

423
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,359
no matter what we face

424
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,880
we need to ensure that we have the

425
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
capacity to act

426
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,359
that we must act on our own behalf for

427
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
our own survival and for our own

428
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,959
liberation

429
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,480
it is important to

430
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
set yourself to a task that is

431
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
reasonable and fits within your skills

432
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
your abilities

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,120
and what you have to offer at this time

434
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
it's not necessarily something that you

435
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
can aspire to it is something that you

436
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
practice every day by continuing to

437
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,840
learn and collaborate with people

438
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
all people who are facing a certain

439
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
amount of constraint or oppression

440
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
need to have

441
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
an occupation

442
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,600
an occupation is not necessarily a job

443
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,640
an occupation is something that one does

444
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
to continue practicing a capacity to act

445
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
and a capacity to see the humanity of

446
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,679
other people

447
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,840
and meet them fully

448
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,799
and work with them

449
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,160
very often

450
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,120
these things may be very simple

451
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,360
it may be as simple as getting to know

452
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
the people in your neighborhood and hear

453
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
their stories

454
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
it may be as simple as talking to the

455
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,440
people you work with

456
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
about

457
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
how much money they're being paid to do

458
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
the job that they're doing

459
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,480
or what other opportunities may better

460
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
suit the vision they have for their own

461
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,639
life

462
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,320
by continuing to maintain those

463
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,919
connections

464
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,880
we maintain our ability to act

465
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
we maintain control of our own

466
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,720
imagination of what is possible

467
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,120
when we work in the technical field

468
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
it can be very very easy

469
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
to see

470
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
the tools and the technology as the

471
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,559
solutions themselves

472
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,880
to believe that if we can just code the

473
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
right thing if we can just think of the

474
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
right tool that we can solve the problem

475
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
the human beings

476
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
are the solutions the human beings are

477
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,679
not the problem

478
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,080
when you work in technology you have the

479
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
ability to create a tool that can serve

480
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,039
the needs of people

481
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
and holding that in the forefront of our

482
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,360
mind is going to make the difference in

483
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
the years to come

484
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
i learned a lot in my time as a sex

485
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
worker

486
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,120
namely i learned what it meant to work

487
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,559
there's a meme

488
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
that has floated around the internet and

489
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,080
for those of you who haven't seen it

490
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
allow me the awkward moment to explain

491
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
it to you

492
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
in this meme there is the text

493
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,120
sex work is sex and sex is bad

494
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,960
the next panel

495
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
indicates

496
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,840
sex work is sex

497
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
and sex is good

498
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,679
the next panel

499
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,520
says

500
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,360
sex work is work and work is good

501
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,919
the final panel says sex work is work

502
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
and work is bad

503
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
what does this mean especially in the

504
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
context of conference that's going to

505
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,559
tell you how to break into a workplace

506
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,000
and how to support the people that you

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,480
meet there

508
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
what this has taught me over the years

509
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,679
is that

510
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,400
despite whatever trappings or marketing

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
or hype we put around our work at the

512
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
end of the day it is a transaction for

513
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,919
resources

514
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
it is not the assessment of who we are

515
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,520
for our full potential

516
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,840
early in the sex worker rights movement

517
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
people talked a lot about liberation or

518
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,799
the empowering aspects of doing this

519
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,840
work

520
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
and

521
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,799
anyone in the erotic trades will tell

522
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,640
you that that will pretty much fall by

523
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
the wayside pretty quickly

524
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
for whatever empowerment i may have felt

525
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
in the erotic trades

526
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
i have also felt a great great amount of

527
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,159
marginalization opposition

528
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,520
violence

529
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
and general interference with my own

530
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
humanity

531
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,320
this was never empowering to face

532
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
stigma poses a risk to my life and to

533
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
that of my family

534
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,520
i live in a place

535
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
and a time

536
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,960
that will never stop holding that over

537
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
my head

538
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
it is something that will always be an

539
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,720
obstacle for me to overcome

540
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,039
when i try to break into a workplace or

541
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
i try to find community with the people

542
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
i live amongst

543
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
that part is not empowering

544
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,000
what was empowering was the fact that i

545
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,159
could take action on my own behalf from

546
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,679
my own survival

547
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,159
to get the resources that i needed in

548
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
order to achieve

549
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,880
some

550
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,559
measure of the quality of life for

551
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,120
myself

552
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
whether or not this is work that i

553
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,039
would choose under different

554
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,520
circumstances or not

555
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
it is the word that has been chosen for

556
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,799
me

557
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,200
or that i have at least agreed to take

558
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
on

559
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,919
what i have always had to learn to

560
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,520
remember though

561
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
is that the work itself is not my

562
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,840
liberation

563
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,039
it might be the way we keep our

564
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,000
customers coming back for more

565
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,039
but when i go to work i am going to work

566
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,799
to obtain resources

567
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,480
that help me pursue

568
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,440
the goals for freedom and equality and

569
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
liberation that i seek

570
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,600
many of our workplaces

571
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,760
want to collapse

572
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
the context of our lives into our

573
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,159
workplace

574
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,760
we're told to find a job that we love

575
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
pursuing a goal that we have

576
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,200
that can be a distraction to what is

577
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
actually going on

578
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,919
when you take a job

579
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,760
or when you build a technical tool

580
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
bear in mind

581
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
that you are in exchange with an

582
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
employer

583
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,679
it may not always be possible to do the

584
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,080
job that you love the most

585
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
or to find a career that affirms your

586
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,760
heart and soul

587
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
oftentimes

588
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,600
it's going to be a compromise it's going

589
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
to be something that we can at least

590
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,400
approve of on some level

591
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,679
that we can do

592
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,640
that we feel is not

593
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
totally in violation of our beliefs and

594
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,440
our own humanity

595
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,840
when an employer tells you that they are

596
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,880
representing freedom or liberation

597
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,960
but you're probably seeing

598
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,000
is marketing hobby

599
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,480
and it's important to remember that

600
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
because when our workplaces tell us that

601
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
working for their agenda and the

602
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,960
outcomes they want to see

603
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,720
are equivalent to our own freedoms and

604
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
liberation we've sold ourselves short

605
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
and we've cut ourselves off from what is

606
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,399
possible

607
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,760
work is work

608
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,679
and work is what lets us access

609
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,320
resources

610
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
proximity to privilege and to power

611
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
in many ways governs the choices that we

612
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
can make

613
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,240
some people are going to have to take

614
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,159
the job that is offered for them because

615
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
that's what's necessary for them to

616
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
continue surviving

617
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,240
other people might have more choices

618
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,640
that allow them to pick projects

619
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,440
or

620
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
to work to build tools that they can

621
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,640
really stand behind

622
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
if you are faced with a workplace that

623
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
is doing something that you don't

624
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,760
believe in

625
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
but you know that you don't have the

626
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
full freedom to take another job right

627
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
now

628
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,799
you always have the option to be a bad

629
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,039
worker

630
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,240
that's right

631
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
i'm giving you permission to be a bad

632
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,919
worker

633
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,320
it's okay to work slowly because this is

634
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,600
your time not theirs

635
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
it is okay to

636
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
interfere

637
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
or to

638
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,640
perhaps work against the tools that you

639
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
believe might cost somebody else their

640
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,760
life or their humanity

641
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,720
you do not have to submit to the demands

642
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,440
in advance

643
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,400
as roe v wade affects the way

644
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,960
legislation looks across this country

645
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
we've seen a number of places

646
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
that are directing their efforts and

647
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,679
their work towards the very letter of

648
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,640
the law

649
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,799
rather than the beliefs that they have

650
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
they look at the law

651
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
and they see what their possible

652
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
viability is for breaking it

653
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
and they act

654
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
in advance of any

655
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,840
direct command

656
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,679
or request

657
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,240
to cause harm to somebody

658
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,039
you do not always have to do this

659
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,880
you do not have to report somebody in

660
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,159
advance

661
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
if you don't have to

662
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,279
you don't have to look for the ways in

663
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
which the people accessing your service

664
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
or your tools

665
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,039
might be in direct violation of the

666
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,080
black and white text

667
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
you can make the choice

668
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,400
to act

669
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,559
as an accomplice when someone is using

670
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,799
those tools in a way that perhaps your

671
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,760
employer doesn't care for

672
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
i have a story i would like to tell you

673
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,840
about technology and various tools that

674
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
we use online

675
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,679
the year was 2004

676
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,600
and i was a very young

677
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,480
up-and-coming queer person

678
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
i was home from college

679
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,919
and i was looking forward to an

680
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
opportunity to meet

681
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
someone else who like me was

682
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
young and queer

683
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,360
i went to a website called craigslist

684
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
and i clicked on a link called casual

685
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,600
encounters

686
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,400
i looked through all those postings in a

687
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
much older form of the internet that

688
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
didn't have the pictures and certainly

689
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
not the video it was just

690
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,440
text

691
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,279
from people who were looking for other

692
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,279
people

693
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,840
in all that content i found a listing

694
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
from somebody that seemed like a person

695
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,640
i might want to get to know

696
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
like me

697
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
they were a queer woman

698
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,320
they were a self-identified leader dyke

699
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,039
and

700
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
i liked the cut of their jib

701
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
i sent them a message they sent one back

702
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,120
and soon enough we were on the phone

703
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,279
we set a date and we went to go see a

704
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,039
movie together

705
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,360
now to set the scene

706
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
we all have the classic vision of a

707
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
couple on a date going to see perhaps a

708
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,919
horror film and snuggling in close

709
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,279
letting the tension of what was

710
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,080
happening on screen via justification to

711
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,880
hold and be near each other

712
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
we were watching natalie portman on the

713
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,240
screen and

714
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,559
screen we were watching natalie portman

715
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
on the screen and

716
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,919
almost like a horror film

717
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,880
we were crawling into one another's arms

718
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,799
at the sheer intensity of what we were

719
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,039
watching and how much it was impacting

720
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,080
us

721
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
we were connecting

722
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,520
based on our desire

723
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,919
not just for who was on the screen but

724
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,840
for one

725
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,679
another we enjoyed the movie

726
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,840
we enjoyed our time together

727
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,640
and

728
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,080
we decided to talk longer into the night

729
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,480
it was in that conversation

730
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,559
that my new friend told me

731
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,960
that she was off to go and participate

732
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
in an event in a protest called camp

733
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,799
trans

734
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,880
i responded rather ignorantly what's

735
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
camp trans which

736
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,320
did not impress my date very much

737
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,880
she followed that up very patiently to

738
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
unburden me of my ignorance with some

739
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
more information she told me that it was

740
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,559
a protest outside of the women's

741
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,640
michigan women's festival

742
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,960
and that it was based on the policies at

743
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
the door that deliberately and

744
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,960
explicitly excluded

745
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
transgender women

746
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,200
it was because

747
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
that we met that night that i was able

748
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
to become

749
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,760
a better more informed person who is

750
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,240
more aware of injustice and what people

751
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
were doing about it

752
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,399
and it might be easy to say that that

753
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,399
meeting was facilitated by craigslist

754
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,799
that without craigslist i would not have

755
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
had that moment

756
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,200
that i need to credit this form of a

757
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
tactical tool

758
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,279
for what happened

759
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,840
when i take full inventory of myself

760
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,919
however and i think of that night i

761
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
remember that it was not the tool

762
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,480
it was my desire

763
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
it was the desire of the person that i

764
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,679
was needing

765
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,240
it was the fact that we were two humans

766
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
who wanted to find one another

767
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,360
to establish some form of intimacy and

768
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
connection

769
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,760
craigslist was the tool that mediated it

770
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,559
but it could have been so many things

771
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,679
it could have been the back of a

772
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,279
magazine or a newspaper from the

773
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,799
alternative press it could have been a

774
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,919
bar

775
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,360
it could have been a hangout it could

776
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,039
have been through friends but

777
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,200
what mattered was

778
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
we felt our desire

779
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,679
was worthy of action

780
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,760
that what made us feel pleasure

781
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
was something that could help us become

782
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,799
the people that we were

783
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,320
without remembering that it was desire

784
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,480
that brought us together it can be easy

785
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,640
to say that it was the tool itself and

786
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,159
that what we need are

787
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,120
more tools that are like craigslist

788
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
what we have to remember is that those

789
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,440
tools were facilitating our needs

790
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,640
and it was our needs that were centered

791
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,559
when you're building a technical tool

792
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,960
and you're working in technology

793
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,200
remember that it is the desire and the

794
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,919
needs of the humans that come first

795
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
don't center the technology itself

796
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,799
when we center technology as our

797
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,880
salvation or as the end-all be-all of

798
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,279
our community and our networking

799
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,440
we are in many ways asking people to

800
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
conform to the needs of the technology

801
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,399
and the tools

802
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,120
it must always be the other way around

803
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
and that means

804
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,200
really looking at ourselves

805
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,080
and remembering that who we are

806
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,799
and what we want and what we desire is

807
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,480
important

808
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,399
that the tools that we make

809
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,360
need to serve the people who use them

810
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,158
not the other way around

811
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
hello and good morning

812
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,600
thank you so much for watching my video

813
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,519
i wanted since we were starting so

814
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,480
bright and early to get away from just

815
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,799
this uh this little uh backdrop that i

816
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,159
have which is imperfectly tacked up in

817
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,880
front of a very messy room

818
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,080
uh

819
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,240
so but i'm happy to come live and i

820
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
wanted to talk a little bit about the

821
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
tool uh that probably brought me in the

822
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,919
room today

823
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,679
and is uh giving me a lot of things to

824
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,120
do lately

825
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,679
and uh that was the fact that i went to

826
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,679
a technology conference

827
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,360
and i

828
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,120
i was demonstrating an abortion tool

829
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,279
and i want to show you that briefly it's

830
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,720
something that i'm going to be showing

831
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
people

832
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,039
at the las vegas event in august up

833
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,640
close and in person so i hope that

834
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
you'll be there so that i can actually

835
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,279
really break it down step by step but

836
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,720
just to do a quick drive by

837
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,600
this is a manual vacuum aspirator this

838
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
is something that is mass-produced and

839
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,960
used around the world uh so that

840
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
abortion services can take place it's an

841
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,080
abortion tool

842
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,840
and

843
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,919
this is a jar

844
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,799
with tubes and a cannula

845
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,640
and a syringe and it does the same thing

846
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,720
so it's it's an improv it's an

847
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,600
improvised um abortion tool

848
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
and it was something that i was really

849
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
happy to show people

850
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
uh to remind them that even though we

851
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,320
have

852
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
a certain amount of legislation uh even

853
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,279
though we have a deficit of clinical

854
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,640
resources

855
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,600
that uh the picture is is so much bigger

856
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,760
and the more that we understand this

857
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,240
technology the more we can understand

858
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,559
what we need to protect with the law and

859
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,640
the better we can refer people who need

860
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
this care

861
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,679
if we don't really have a full

862
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,679
comprehensive understanding of abortion

863
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,559
it can

864
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,760
it feel really really really

865
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
overwhelming and it can be hard to

866
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,640
direct people to the right resources

867
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
i also want to talk about the importance

868
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,199
of solidarity and using language

869
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,399
i am someone who identifies as a woman i

870
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,079
am someone who identifies as a mother

871
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
and that's the language that describes

872
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,960
my experience um with reproduction and

873
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,199
reproductive technologies when i'm

874
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,280
talking about reproductive technology as

875
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,719
a whole however my experience is not the

876
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,280
end-all be-all there are so many people

877
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
for so many reasons who use reproductive

878
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,320
technologies and for so many different

879
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,520
purposes that if i just specifically

880
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,320
frame everything with my experience or

881
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
if i uh frame it only within uh one

882
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
particular group with one particular use

883
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,918
i'm not really taking in the whole big

884
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,000
picture and it's impossible to have full

885
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
solidarity so i i really hope that as

886
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
the conversation about roe v wade and

887
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,680
abortion access uh continues as it will

888
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,000
for many years that we can all remember

889
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,079
that and take that step to remember that

890
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,720
we have an experience within a big big

891
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,640
moment in time

892
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,960
and we need to keep thinking about

893
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,440
the just unlimited diversity of the

894
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
human experience and all the ways that

895
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,119
laws

896
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,880
bad laws can shut people out

897
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,119
but when i was building this tool and as

898
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,599
i began to share it i had to look back

899
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,359
upon my whole

900
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,599
long

901
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,839
longer by the day career within

902
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
reproductive rights activism

903
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,000
and imagination stood out to me uh it

904
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,839
really stood out to me because i got

905
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,359
into this movement

906
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,880
as a teenager

907
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,960
and it happened almost on accident i was

908
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,400
on a high school trip to washington dc

909
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,800
like a lot of high schoolers do or a lot

910
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,440
of tourists it's it's a place to see for

911
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
sure it's our nation's capital and just

912
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,440
by sheer coincidence that trip was

913
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,880
scheduled for

914
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,200
what was the 30th anniversary of roe v

915
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
wade in in 2003

916
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,000
and i was standing on the steps of the

917
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,520
supreme court

918
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,160
and i looked out at just the whole uh

919
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
the whole open space before me

920
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
and it was full of people more people

921
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
than i had ever seen in one place before

922
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
in my life

923
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
and the number of people there to

924
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
protest didn't just extend from the

925
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
steps of the supreme court to the white

926
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,119
house building it went clear on back to

927
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,960
the washington monument

928
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,000
and

929
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,839
the whole time i was in the city for

930
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,880
that whole

931
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,000
week

932
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,599
i could see groups of people who were

933
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,320
there representing that big mass

934
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,440
and

935
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,839
they were uh

936
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:46,880
there to

937
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,720
explicitly to

938
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,440
protest roe v wade they were

939
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,560
overwhelmingly about 95 probably

940
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,200
uh pro-life protesters

941
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,359
and in that moment

942
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,880
i i was alarmed and i i felt quite

943
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,800
certain that within my lifetime i was

944
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,599
going to see roe v wade fall

945
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,200
purely because i could see the power of

946
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,119
the imagination of the people in front

947
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,000
of me

948
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
uh despite the fact that a lot of us

949
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,079
thought it was a simple fact something

950
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,760
that we could take for granted that roe

951
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,839
v wade existed that it was it was

952
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,000
protected that it was settled law

953
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,680
there were a lot of people who were

954
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,320
imagining a very very very different

955
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
future and they didn't limit their

956
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,359
imagination at all they knew what their

957
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,000
goal was and they were working together

958
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,320
very very hard to make that happen and

959
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
they utilized a wide diversity of

960
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,599
tactics

961
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,760
so i understood that

962
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,320
uh it was important for me not to just

963
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,200
imagine the existence of this one law um

964
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
or this one case law

965
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,200
uh but to also just to imagine that i

966
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,119
needed to have

967
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,599
something just as big if not bigger in

968
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,560
my mind when i would do my activist work

969
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,079
i had to remember that i didn't just

970
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,200
want one law that protected reproductive

971
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,839
rights that i wanted there to be

972
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,560
reproductive access for all people that

973
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,520
uh that i would occupy a world where

974
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,359
people had bodily autonomy where they

975
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,119
could make the decisions that they

976
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,640
needed to make to achieve the vision

977
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,200
they had for their own life and i i

978
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,800
really wanted to have a big imagination

979
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
so that i could be the best activist i

980
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,920
could be

981
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,680
and i i've done a lot of different

982
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,200
things uh

983
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,680
one of the uh positions that i hold is

984
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,839
that of a full spectrum doula

985
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,480
uh doula is a term that is somewhat

986
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,520
contested uh within my field and that's

987
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
because it goes back to ancient greek

988
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,040
and it refers to an individual who was

989
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,880
a servant or in

990
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
the slave class system

991
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,800
who would assist with birth with the

992
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,960
basically the most practical basic

993
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
aspects they provided emotional and

994
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,119
practical support to someone who was in

995
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,079
labor

996
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,640
uh they helped do the cleanup work uh

997
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,880
they did the messy stuff the hands-on

998
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,560
and the hands-on work

999
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
and uh

1000
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,680
as

1001
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,640
the work of doulas started to get bigger

1002
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,880
it really became focused you know

1003
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,280
primarily and very directly to assist

1004
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,680
people in labor and delivery

1005
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,400
and the full spectrum doula movement

1006
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,720
kind of emerged to say that

1007
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
that's one experience and it's a very

1008
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,880
important experience but there are so

1009
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,240
many other

1010
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,040
possible reproductive outcomes and there

1011
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,839
is

1012
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,480
no um no one who should ever have to go

1013
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
through any of those alone or face all

1014
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
of the bureaucratic hurdles

1015
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,920
um

1016
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
you know that that that can you know

1017
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
just really make a process more

1018
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,200
difficult than it needs to be they

1019
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,359
shouldn't have to face that alone

1020
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,280
and it was also because the uh the doula

1021
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,359
kind of field was full of people who

1022
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,640
also had a lot of anti-abortion

1023
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,280
uh positions and ideologies

1024
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,359
uh that was a you know it was kind of in

1025
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,280
many ways unquestioned that it just

1026
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,960
existed that anyone who called

1027
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,599
themselves a doula would of course be

1028
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,839
opposed to abortion because you care so

1029
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,680
much about

1030
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
babies and

1031
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
i do i do care about babies very very

1032
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
much

1033
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,640
but that was something that

1034
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,240
myself and many other people who shared

1035
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,000
my beliefs realized we couldn't allow to

1036
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
go uncontested

1037
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,960
uh

1038
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,800
but that was also a form of activism

1039
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,640
that was rooted in care and because i

1040
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,960
was providing direct care i was always

1041
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,640
having to engage

1042
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
uh with the different types of legal

1043
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,880
landscapes that i was facing

1044
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,960
and it just kept broadening and

1045
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,800
broadening and broadening my perspective

1046
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
over the years

1047
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,960
uh

1048
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,119
in terms of what it meant for me to take

1049
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,280
action on my beliefs and what i thought

1050
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,880
was going to be necessary for us to

1051
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,280
imagine

1052
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,000
so solidarity work is really important

1053
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,640
because we're not just looking at single

1054
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,960
issue problems right now

1055
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
that solidarity is what also allows me

1056
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,119
to see uh

1057
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,839
the the huge number this huge increase

1058
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,480
of

1059
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,160
anti-lgbtq legislation and and in this

1060
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,920
case it really is

1061
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,240
the whole umbrella is under attack in so

1062
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
many ways in terms of books we can read

1063
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,200
about to read about queer experiences

1064
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,079
it's access to gender affirming care for

1065
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,240
people who are transgender or gender

1066
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
non-conforming

1067
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,000
it has so many so many different

1068
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,680
manifestations

1069
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,240
and i i don't think i would ever really

1070
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
have the full imagination to foresee it

1071
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,839
without having

1072
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,839
done direct work with people and and

1073
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,319
really seen uh gotten into the belly of

1074
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,240
the beast

1075
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,040
it's also reminded me that um

1076
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
you know something has to be fully

1077
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,200
accessible to everybody and and that's

1078
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,880
where the

1079
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,920
the goal has to be and so i've also done

1080
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,280
some work within

1081
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,599
the criminal justice system to support

1082
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,400
people who are incarcerated

1083
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,079
with

1084
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,319
their reproductive health and that has

1085
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,920
been to help support

1086
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,960
birth

1087
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,119
behind bars that has also been to help

1088
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,599
advocate on behalf of people who

1089
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,920
may be wanting to access abortion or

1090
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,040
also to

1091
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800
to be aware of the way that the the

1092
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
prison justice system makes decisions

1093
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,040
about reproduction for people in terms

1094
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,720
of involuntary sterilization

1095
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,079
and the like

1096
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,000
that that is all under the purview of

1097
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,040
reproductive justice

1098
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,280
uh reproductive justice is also a

1099
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,720
movement that i you know i really

1100
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,280
encourage everyone to look into

1101
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,119
reproductive justice is something that

1102
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,560
came out of

1103
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
90s activism

1104
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,599
among

1105
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,680
women of color and it was it really came

1106
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,400
out of a group called sister song and

1107
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,319
that was about in many ways having a

1108
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,240
bigger imagination for what the

1109
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,960
reproductive rights movement could do

1110
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,319
it looked at

1111
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,000
rights as kind of a

1112
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,359
a very limiting way to look at things

1113
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,119
in terms of is abortion legal or illegal

1114
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,640
that's certainly one part and those

1115
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,720
those laws are are really important for

1116
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,800
us to look at and having legal access to

1117
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
abortion is very important but

1118
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,440
reproductive justice really looks at the

1119
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
whole person

1120
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,640
and and what they're facing and their

1121
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,480
ability to

1122
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,920
not just have an abortion but also to

1123
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,240
have a child and have that child be

1124
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,359
raised in a safe and affirming world

1125
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,839
um it is it's about the right to

1126
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,160
to have that you know family on your own

1127
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
terms in safe ways

1128
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,680
um or to have access to uh reproductive

1129
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,720
health

1130
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,520
um as necessary and it's also about

1131
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,800
including the right to having um primary

1132
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,240
sexual pleasure in encounters that

1133
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,599
someone's pleasure matters that

1134
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,480
someone's desire matters

1135
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,800
looking at issues of of consent and um

1136
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,000
and and education and full resources and

1137
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,560
the more i was exposed to that the

1138
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,200
uh the more i learned and and the more i

1139
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,400
grew

1140
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
uh so that's something that i definitely

1141
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,839
want to look into

1142
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,880
uh but i do i do get a lot of people who

1143
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,440
um have been emailing me and they've

1144
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,359
wanted to know more about this and and

1145
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,599
i'm always happy to to share that

1146
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,280
knowledge that i have

1147
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,200
what i don't want people to do is think

1148
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,599
that they have to walk away from this

1149
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,880
and know

1150
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
how to go out and perform abortions or

1151
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,440
that i'm recruiting people to go out and

1152
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,319
perform abortions or that it's necessary

1153
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,359
for everybody to know how to do this and

1154
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,839
and that's not the case i think knowing

1155
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,119
how it works on a theoretical level

1156
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,160
is going to help make you more informed

1157
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,480
but it's not necessarily a full-on skill

1158
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,560
that everyone has to to develop so

1159
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,520
you know if you're thinking about

1160
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,880
emailing me or this is something that

1161
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,359
you want to learn more about um

1162
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,960
you know keep that in mind that yeah i'm

1163
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,119
happy to show people uh but it doesn't

1164
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,079
necessarily mean you're gonna be

1165
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,760
qualified to do so and it doesn't mean

1166
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,400
that you absolutely have to do so

1167
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,920
uh i think the most important thing that

1168
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,960
we can do

1169
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,440
is hold on to our hearts and hold on to

1170
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,800
our heads

1171
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,400
uh because we're going to face a very

1172
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,680
dizzying array of news and information

1173
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,839
that is going to be very overwhelming to

1174
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,079
confront and if we're all trying to

1175
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,640
remember like a bullet point list of

1176
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,160
things to do

1177
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,680
the number of things on that list is

1178
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
just going to be way too many to

1179
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,920
consider at all times

1180
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,079
but if you can come back to

1181
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,480
having your heart and having your head

1182
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,040
in line with with what you believe and

1183
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,520
who you are and how important it is that

1184
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,599
you are who you are you're going to be

1185
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,200
able to face

1186
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,400
you know

1187
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,720
unforeseen situations with a great deal

1188
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,440
of wisdom and uh

1189
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,839
and then that's that's so important

1190
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,440
that is so important

1191
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,119
it's you know people very often point

1192
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,680
out that the first thing that a dictator

1193
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,760
or an abusive political ruler does when

1194
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,520
they come into power is to begin to

1195
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,000
limit the press or the media and that's

1196
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,920
true it's a very practical thing for

1197
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,520
them to do to be in charge of the

1198
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,599
information that goes out

1199
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,520
but also the part of that is really is

1200
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,119
that it's about trying to be in charge

1201
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,119
of people's imaginations

1202
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,040
and try to limit that so that people

1203
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,599
start to think this is all that there is

1204
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,520
this is all that there ever was and this

1205
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,560
is all that there ever will be and so i

1206
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,480
need to make my choices

1207
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,000
um within this system and if that's what

1208
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,400
we're left with it can be very very easy

1209
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,240
to come back to a

1210
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,960
 you got mine position because

1211
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,560
that's what scarcity can do it can

1212
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,400
really scare us into that kind of a

1213
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,520
place

1214
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,040
because we think that the only choice

1215
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,960
that we can make is one that comes at

1216
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,560
the expense of somebody else because

1217
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,680
it's us versus them at all times

1218
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,960
and uh and that's that's not true

1219
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,599
that's not true we're not outnumbered

1220
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,560
um but we are we are out imagined in

1221
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,920
many ways

1222
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,359
and maintaining that full imagination uh

1223
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,800
is going to be the most important thing

1224
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,880
you can do more than any given thing

1225
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,040
that you can read or any given skill

1226
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,800
that you can master because you're going

1227
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,280
to learn and master so many skills that

1228
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,359
comes from curiosity and that's a

1229
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,359
beautiful curiosity

1230
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,680
but remembering to always work with

1231
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,280
tools or build tools with a full

1232
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,520
imagination will help you build so much

1233
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,680
more and do so many more things with the

1234
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,480
tools that are available

1235
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,119
as i come to a close i want to offer so

1236
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,280
much thanks to the people behind the

1237
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,680
scenes who made this possible because

1238
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,720
i'm here

1239
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,319
in so many ways because people were

1240
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,880
acting in solidarity in ways that i am

1241
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,480
deeply grateful for

1242
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,839
um

1243
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,760
it's i'm sometimes an unconventional

1244
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,280
choice for a speaker i'm a little bit

1245
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,559
eccentric

1246
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,319
uh i have some

1247
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,319
you know some very you know fringe

1248
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,960
beliefs in many ways um

1249
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,119
and so people were acting in solidarity

1250
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,119
when they listened to me and they they

1251
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,800
have given me this opportunity to speak

1252
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,000
with you

1253
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,440
um and and thank you to all of them uh

1257
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,760
given me to consider things like these

1258
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,839

1260
