kicking imposter syndrome to the curb

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,159
this talk is about my experience how i

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,040
discovered i had imposter syndrome and

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
the steps i've taken to kick it to the

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
curb

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
so first a little about me

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920

chill he comes to company meetings the

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
only thing we don't really like is when

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
he decides to eat his life or lunch on

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
my desk

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
i started out as a hotel manager and

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
then i pivoted into it as a pc

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,079
i'd like to thank the diana initiative

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,800
for having me here today and also i'd

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,878
like to thank ellen fair enough for

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,879
mentoring me and helping me with my

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
proposal for this talk he was super

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
awesome and helped me a lot

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
so i have a couple of things for you to

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,800
think about

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
do you know what imposter syndrome is

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
and what does imposter syndrome mean to

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
you if you do know what it is

66
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,200
merriam-webster's definition of imposter

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
syndrome is a psychological condition

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
that is characterized by persistent

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
doubt concerning one's abilities or

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,879
accomplishments accompanied by the fear

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,599
of being exposed as a fraud despite

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,959
evidence of one's ongoing success

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
so for me i don't particularly like this

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,920
definition i feel like a fraud is

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,519
someone who's purposely trying to

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,879
deceive other people or be deceptive and

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
i don't think anyone who suffers from

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
imposter syndrome is doing that we're

79
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
not out there intentionally deceiving

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,480
people

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,680
um i for me imposter syndrome is just

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
constant self-doubt

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
lack of self-confidence

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
anxiety and worrying about how other

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,239
people see me

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
i found this meme in a blog about

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
imposter syndrome and the link is in the

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
slides

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,360
and um i thought this was a great one

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,319
for me because i do beat myself up for

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,920
all of these things

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,879
i

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,840
constantly stay up at night worrying

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
and getting really anxious about stuff

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
that's out of my control stuff everyone

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
else has literally forgotten about like

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,280
maybe a conversation i had with somebody

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
and i lay in bed wondering

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
did i offend them do they not like me

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,439
did i say something wrong did they get

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
mad afterwards but honestly it was

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,599
probably a four-minute conversation

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,959
about what we were going to have for

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
lunch and they are not even thinking

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
about that now they're sound asleep

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
and then stuff that nobody else has even

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,760
noticed

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,279
so as i said in my uh perception of

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,519
imposter syndrome i feel like self-doubt

110
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
plays a huge part

111
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,160
um

112
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
i'm sure if you do suffer you have sat

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,880
in team meetings and had these thoughts

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
you know um you may not want to speak up

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
during the meeting because you feel like

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
you don't know as much as your teammates

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
do or you don't want them to think

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
you're incompetent you don't want to say

119
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
the wrong thing and say it sounds stupid

120
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
um also you may just feel like

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
constantly like no matter how hard you

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
work you're not going to be able to

123
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
prove that you're as good as everyone

124
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
else that you work with

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
so think about this what self-doubt

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
doubt thoughts do you have during

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,759
meetings in your personal life

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
during activities with other groups

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
maybe groups of parents or um

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
people in some community in your

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
community or a community you volunteer

132
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
with

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
how do you um

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
you know beat yourself up with these

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
self-doubt thoughts

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
and how do we keep it from happening

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
that's something else that you should

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
think about how do you keep those

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,280
self-doubt thoughts at bay

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
so asanas block turn imposter syndrome

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
into confidence between tips for

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
managers and individuals

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,120
lists

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,080
uh

145
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
characteristics of imposter syndrome

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
sorry i have to move my head out of the

147
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,719
way

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
and um

149
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
so these are this is just a short list

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,880
there's actually

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,160
i'm sure a lot of other characteristics

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
and i'm sure if you put pen to paper or

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
finger to keyboard you could come up

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
with a list yourself

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
but i've thought that these

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,520
particular characteristics definitely

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,479
applied to me and my imposter syndrome

158
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,759
um i used to always feel that my skills

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,560
or confidence were lacking i always felt

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,919
like um

161
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
i wasn't going to do something right

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
because i didn't have

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,479
this

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
the stellar skills to do it

165
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,639
um if i

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
worked on a project and completed it and

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
i got kudos for that i would kind of

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
just shrug it up and be like oh yeah

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,840
thanks you know

170
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,639
um it was just luck and googling

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,600
um just constantly worrying that you're

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
not good enough or

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,759
if you work remote particularly you may

174
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,600
find yourself isolating yourself from

175
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
team members

176
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
i still do that at times where i just

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
kind of pull back and don't communicate

178
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,280
with anyone

179
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
um

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,639
perfectionism a lot of us who suffer

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,759
from

182
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,840
impostor syndrome definitely work toward

183
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,039
perfectionism which is really just a

184
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,440
waste of time in in my opinion i've come

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
to realize for example

186
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,039
i um when i record talks i record them

187
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,199
10 or 15 times trying to get them

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,240
perfect

189
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
and now i realize no matter how many

190
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
times i record them

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
i'm gonna make mistakes if i was doing a

192
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,039
live talk i would make mistakes

193
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
um overwork and burnout that's something

194
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
that we also suffer from right we're

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
trying to prove ourselves so we're

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
working

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,479
probably more hours than we need to

198
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,639
we're putting in extra time

199
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
and that's going to cause you to burn

200
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
out and you know what most people are

201
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
not going to notice that you work 60

202
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
hours in a week on a particular project

203
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,639
or tasks it's just going to be you who

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
notices and then you're going to be

205
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,479
really tired and the next week is not

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
going to be great because you're just

207
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,599
burnt and done with it

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
setting impossibly high standards for

209
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,720
yourself

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,520
i don't know if it comes with age or the

211
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
fact that i i'm working toward getting

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
rid of imposter syndrome but i have

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
definitely lowered the bar for standards

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
for myself i do not try to be perfect i

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
don't try to get perfect scores on tests

216
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,440
anymore

217
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,599
you know i'm just happy if i pass them

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,199
now

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
low self-esteem intense fear failure and

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,000
decreased self-confidence these are

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
definitely all characteristics that

222
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
ruled my life for a really long time

223
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
so what other characteristics would you

224
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
add to the list something else that you

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,039
should think about

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,440
there are actions by other people

227
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
that feed your imposter syndrome um so

228
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
these are actions by other people that

229
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,360
have come into my life and have fed my

230
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
impostor syndrome

231
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
being blown off

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,440
uh

233
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
giving input during meetings and people

234
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
just ignore me or they constantly

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
interrupt me when i speak and step on my

236
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
words or move on to other topics and

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
they don't hear me

238
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
authority figures teammates family

239
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,399
members teachers all people who may put

240
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
you down either intentionally or

241
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
unintentionally

242
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,959
that certainly feeds imposter syndrome

243
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,279
and then also these same people um

244
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,760
comparing you to someone who's better

245
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
maybe you're getting you're in high

246
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
school and you're being compared to

247
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,760
better students who get better grades

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
um not better but you know students who

249
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
get better grades than you but you might

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
be really skilled in other areas it may

251
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
not be your thing for example i was not

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,560
great in algebra

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600
and it

254
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
it still isn't my thing i think

255
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
i just have a terrible fear of algebra

256
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
but being compared to students who are

257
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
amazing in algebra didn't help with my

258
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
impostor syndrome

259
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
what feeds your imposter syndrome what

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
actions do other people take that feeds

261
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
your imposter syndrome and makes it

262
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
harder for you to work towards moving

263
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
away from it

264
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
i did some research and i tried to find

265
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
studies on impostor syndrome

266
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,600
um there's really not a lot out there i

267
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
think

268
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
there probably will be more as

269
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,680
you know time progresses and more people

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
know about imposter syndrome

271
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,640
i was able to find a few studies most of

272
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
them targeted women

273
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,800
i will say that men certainly suffer

274
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
from imposter syndrome as as well but

275
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
maybe it's not as out there in the open

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
or maybe they're just aren't as many who

277
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
do

278
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
so in my research i found that women of

279
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,320
color are highest rate kenan studies

280
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,480
followed by trans women and women who

281
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
work in male dominated industries such

282
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,360
as manufacturing health care and

283
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
information technology or information

284
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,720
security

285
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
the kpmg study which is linked in this

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,040
slide

287
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,079
noted that 75 of women executives have

288
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,320
experienced impastor syndrome at some

289
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
point in their careers

290
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,880
um 85 percent have not talked about it

291
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
because they don't want to be seen as

292
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
weak

293
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,440
and less than five percent of employers

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
have actually addressed impostor

295
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,959
syndrome with their staff

296
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
so now i want to talk about how i

297
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
learned about imposter syndrome and what

298
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,800
it was i actually did not know what this

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
term was until two years ago

300
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,959
a little over two years ago when the

301
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,720
pandemic started i was in lockdown

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
i decided i was gonna turn a bad thing

303
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
into something good and i started

304
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,399
signing up for different webinars and um

305
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,399
tried to really bump up my virtual

306
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,839
networking

307
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
so i watched an imposter syndrome

308
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,800
perspective excuse me i watched a

309
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
webinar on imposter syndrome

310
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,440
perspectives for black women in tech and

311
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
this was sponsored by women in cyber

312
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,399
security

313
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,279
it's a really awesome webinar and that

314
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
is also linked in this slide

315
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
for you to watch

316
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,399
um

317
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,600
so as i watch this i was like

318
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,560
holy moly i have imposter syndrome now i

319
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,639
know what it is now i have a name for my

320
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,839
intense self-doubt and lack of

321
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,120
self-confidence like i felt like a door

322
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
had opened

323
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,160
and i like

324
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,880
knew

325
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,760
how i had been feeling all these years

326
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
was actually

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
something legit

328
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
my experience with imposter syndrome

329
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
syndrome started as a child it followed

330
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
me into high school and then into my

331
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,880
professional life in i.t and cyber

332
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
security

333
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
mine started out as a child i had a

334
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,240
family member who constantly told me i

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
wasn't good enough

336
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,720
um this person would either

337
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
actually say the words or you know play

338
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
a lot of mind games to make me feel like

339
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,519
i was less than i was or less worthy

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
than i was

341
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
i would do the dishes and that person

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,279
would make me do them over again until i

343
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
did them exactly how he wanted them

344
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,360
just a lot of

345
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
coming down on me that did not help me

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
as a child feel confident in what i

347
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
could do or what i knew

348
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,519
um in high school i was a pretty decent

349
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,880
student but i was horrible in gym class

350
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
i was not an athlete i was the kid that

351
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,600
hung up the second knot up the rope and

352
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320
was like hey i can't do this

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
i just simply wasn't physically strong

354
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,920
enough to climb a rope

355
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
but our gym teachers were not looking at

356
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,720
that they they were looking at the fact

357
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
that i could not climb the rope and they

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
made me feel really bad about myself

359
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
because i couldn't

360
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
um honestly i've never had to climb a

361
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
rope in my life

362
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
and i think

363
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
i'm sure there's a lot of other people

364
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,720
that i was in gym class with who also

365
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,639
have not had to

366
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
i did join a couple of sports teams i

367
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,839
joined soccer and i joined basketball

368
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,240
i ended up benched because i was not

369
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,399
athletic and i wasn't good at it i

370
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,000
really didn't know what i was doing and

371
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
the coaches didn't want to waste the

372
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,760
time on me when they had star athletes

373
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
that they could focus on

374
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,079
so that definitely did not help with my

375
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
self-worth or my

376
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,240
self-confidence

377
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
i basically spent my last two years in

378
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
high school sitting in the computer room

379
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,360
typing away on my little commodore 64

380
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
because that's where i was most

381
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,120
comfortable and i knew i was really good

382
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,279
at it

383
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,839
as i moved into i-team

384
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,839
um my

385
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,959
life of being dismissed by male managers

386
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,920
and male executives began

387
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,760
i had so many examples of times when

388
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
these people

389
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
who

390
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,120
have been in working in corporate for a

391
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,639
really long time

392
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,519
just

393
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,680
walked right by me ignored what i had to

394
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,959
say they i had one person walk by me and

395
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
tell my female manager that he needed me

396
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
to do something rather than just coming

397
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,959
to me and telling me

398
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,120
that really upset me and obviously it

399
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
has stuck with me

400
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,360
um i have had multiple times where i was

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
interrupted in meetings or had my words

402
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,800
stepped on by other male managers

403
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,199
recommendations were ignored until my

404
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
male counterparts agreed with my

405
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
recommendations and then they would get

406
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,800
picked up

407
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,959
i have spoken to managers in the past

408
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,880
and told them how i felt about how they

409
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,720
were treating me and they promised to

410
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
improve but they didn't

411
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
i had someone actually tell me i was

412
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
constantly seeking recognition and i was

413
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,639
jealous of my co-workers which was

414
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,920
absolutely not true i was just trying to

415
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
um get some of the issues i had worked

416
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
out with this person

417
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,199
and um have him not treat me the way he

418
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,800
had been treating me

419
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,959
i've also had female managers who didn't

420
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
stand up for me which really did not

421
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,920
help at all and only fed my impostor

422
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
syndrome

423
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
now if you want to take a minute and

424
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
think about times that maybe you've had

425
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,040
interactions like this and

426
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,880
did that also feed your impostor

427
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
syndrome i would assume that it did

428
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,639
because it certainly isn't none of these

429
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
were positive interactions

430
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
so can we uh recover from impostor

431
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
syndrome is this something that we

432
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
recover from or will imposter syndrome

433
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
always lurk in the background is that

434
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,839
always going to be that little ugly

435
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,920
troll sitting in the woods waiting to

436
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,680
jump up on your shoulder

437
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
and whisper in your ear and bring you

438
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
down

439
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
i don't know i'm trying to recover from

440
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,600
it i'm definitely not fully recovered i

441
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
still have days where that troll is

442
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
clutching to my shoulder and whispering

443
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
in my ear

444
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
but these are the steps that i've been

445
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,280
taking over the past year and a half

446
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
so to start with i left a toxic work

447
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,520
environment i

448
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
finally had kind of had enough of not

449
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
being listened to or

450
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,880
um

451
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
feeling like i just didn't know what i

452
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
was doing

453
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,799
so i found this job at site

454
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,919
and it's been really amazing all of our

455
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
management and executives support us

456
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
they encourage us to get out there and

457
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,679
do things that we normally wouldn't do

458
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
when i first started working at scythe

459
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,080
my male teammates

460
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
and my male managers definitely pushed

461
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
me to

462
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,679
learn to get out there to speak up i

463
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,600
never i've never been in a meeting where

464
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
anybody ignored what i had to say

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,440
and they make me feel like i know what

466
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
i'm doing and that i am worth

467
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
being in cyber security

468
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
um i've also at the beginning of the

469
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,840
pandemic found noreen george's mentor

470
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,120
mentee women in cyber security group

471
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,480
we meet

472
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,919
monthly

473
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
and it's a group of professional cyber

474
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,640
security professionals

475
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,679
students people just starting in cyber

476
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,480
um we we just get together and we talk

477
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,799
about what we're doing and and if we

478
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,120
need help from someone um or if we need

479
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
a mentor or if we're looking to mentor

480
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,240
people

481
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,480
and it's really a fantastic supportive

482
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,200
network i actually did my first talk in

483
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,919
noreen's group because it was a smaller

484
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
group with people that i had been with

485
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
virtually for quite a while and i was

486
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
super comfortable

487
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,840
and it helped really boost my

488
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,480
self-confidence and

489
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
made me realize that i can do talks

490
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
helping noaa authors overcome imposter

491
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
syndrome gives me a lot of confidence

492
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,240
for example me doing these talks on

493
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
impostor syndrome i really hope that i'm

494
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,960
making a difference in some of your

495
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
lives and that

496
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,559
if you don't suffer from imposter

497
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,320
syndrome maybe i'm helping give you

498
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
tools to help other people recover

499
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,200
and learning new things

500
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
that's something that i have been doing

501
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,440
since i started this job at site

502
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
i do not come from a software background

503
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
i was a

504
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
blue teamer a security analyst so

505
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
working in software development world is

506
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,880
a whole new thing there's a lot i need

507
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,919
to learn but i'm learning it and as i

508
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,919
learn and as i practice i get a lot

509
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,600
better at it

510
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
and um

511
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,120
i think that that's really helped boost

512
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
my confidence and push that self-doubt

513
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,400
aside as well

514
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
so i do still have times where i have

515
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
doubts and i doubt my abilities and i

516
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
doubt my knowledge

517
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
that little troll is just up there like

518
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
and you know what i just flick them away

519
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,039
and i'm like look

520
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,640
i can do this i am capable i'm

521
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
knowledgeable and i'm awesome

522
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,240
um

523
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
and also i need to remind myself that

524
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
i'm not going to know everything and all

525
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,440
of the cyber security domains it's i

526
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
don't think anybody can there's so much

527
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,320
information out there in cyber

528
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
but we each have our own little niche of

529
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,440
expertise

530
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,480
so

531
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
i'm going to kick imposter syndrome to

532
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
the curb i'm going to get rid of that

533
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
little troll

534
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
and this is how you can do it too you

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
need to know your worth know that you're

536
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,640
amazing and worthy and knowledgeable and

537
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
you know your stuff that you may be an

538
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,559
expert in

539
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,039
blue teaming or red teaming or purple

540
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,080
teaming

541
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
and maybe you're you

542
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,720
lack

543
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
knowledge in other areas you know but

544
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
if you have a supportive network and you

545
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
surround yourself with people who

546
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
support you and have knowledge in other

547
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
areas

548
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
then you can reach out to them and get

549
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,159
help and learn more

550
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,360
if you work in a unsupportive culture or

551
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
have unsupportive managers maybe it's

552
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,840
time to make that change maybe it's time

553
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,520
to move on to a different job

554
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
and it's okay to fail

555
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
um you know what you don't we're not

556
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,960
always going to be successful nobody is

557
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
but don't beat yourself up if something

558
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
doesn't go the way you wanted it to or a

559
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,840
project you're working on is not going

560
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,360
right

561
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
there's no reason to beat yourself up

562
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
you're doing what you can you're trying

563
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
your best and

564
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,960
you can improve right if you

565
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
if you work on a project that doesn't go

566
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
as well as you wanted it to

567
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
think about the pieces that were lacking

568
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,559
or the gaps and then push yourself learn

569
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,960
what you need to learn um to make it

570
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
successful the next time around

571
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,039
don't let it get to you

572
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,799
and again like i said we don't know

573
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,400
everything we need to learn from people

574
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,640
who have expertise where we don't

575
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,799
the people i work with are amazing they

576
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,240
all uh are very knowledgeable in

577
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
different areas than i am and i have no

578
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,039
problem reaching out to someone and

579
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,120
asking them to either show me how to do

580
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,840
something because i'm a visual learner

581
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
or give me resources

582
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
or hook me up with someone else that

583
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
could help me if they don't have that

584
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,480
knowledge or if they are really busy and

585
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
don't have the time to help at that time

586
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,600
and all of my safe unicorns are

587
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,960
absolutely willing to do this

accept that it's okay not to know all

591
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
the answers and that if you did it would

592
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
mean you're not pushing yourself hard

593
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
enough have faith that it's not only

594
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
acceptable to reach out for help but

595
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
it's actually an effective tool

596
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
and i completely agree with her asking

597
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
for help is not a sign of weakness

598
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
asking for help means that you're

599
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
looking to improve yourself and learn

600
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
more it doesn't mean that you're not

601
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,919
good enough or you don't know enough it

602
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,440
just means you need a little extra boost

603
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
put yourself out there if you don't know

604
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
if you don't try you won't ever know if

605
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
i had never submitted papers to do these

606
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,679
talks i would never know that i was

607
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,679
going to be accepted i would never know

608
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,440
that people were going to

609
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
find my talks useful

610
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
and it really has helped build my

611
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,480
confidence

612
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,799
so just remember you've got this you

613
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
need to get out of your comfort zone

614
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,480
try new things um make a list set some

615
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
goals

616
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
move away from negativity get out away

617
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,840
from those toxic people in toxic

618
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,760
environments that you may be dealing

619
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,799
with

620
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,880
stand up for yourself if you are in

621
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
meetings and people are not listening to

622
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,679
you

623
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
or if you're out in a one-on-one and

624
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,600
your manager is reading his or her they

625
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,400
they're

626
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
sorry

627
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
emails

628
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,559
um

629
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
you know be like hey we're meeting here

630
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,960
eyes up here

631
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
i'm talking

632
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,360
don't let them just ignore you

633
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,320
and like i said before set goals

634
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,760
um

635
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,679
set some small goals at first think

636
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,200
about things that you want to do that

637
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
you've been really afraid to do

638
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,640
and try something try one little thing

639
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
and be yourself stop worrying about what

640
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
everybody else thinks it doesn't matter

641
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,240
you do you

642
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
so i'm going to give you a little bit of

643
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,799
homework

644
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,880
i want you to think about steps that you

645
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,120
can take for your recovery from impostor

646
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
syndrome

647
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,520
make a list of uh actions or items that

648
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
you want to try that are not in your

649
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
comfort zone excuse me your comfort zone

650
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
and set your goals try one thing

651
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,320
be successful try another it's

652
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,559
eventually you're gonna realize that you

653
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,320
have kicked that little troll to the

654
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
curb and you're doing great and you

655
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
don't worry about everyone else and what

656
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,080
they think about you anymore

657
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,760
i want to thank everyone for attending

658
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,360
my talk i really hope that i was able to

659
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
give you some tools to help you work

660
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,279
through this or help other people work

661
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,279

662
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,720
the conference

663
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400

all right thank you so much elaine for

665
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
closing us out with a great discussion

666
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
on imposter syndrome just kind of

667
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,159
something that's i think pretty much

668
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,240
everyone has and if you don't have it

669
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,799
there's next kcd meme for that probably

670
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,840
um

671
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,799
so in another a few minutes actually in

672
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,320
exactly five minutes we're going to be

673
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
