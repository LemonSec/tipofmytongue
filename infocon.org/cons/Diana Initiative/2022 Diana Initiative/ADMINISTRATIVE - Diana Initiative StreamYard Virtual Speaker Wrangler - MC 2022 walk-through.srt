1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,240
all right so i have just clicked uh the

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,200
link

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,639
to

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,120
get into the stream yard backstage

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,960
i'm going to click allow

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
to give it access to my microphone and

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
camera

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
uh i can see this is moving here so it's

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,199
got my microphones i'm gonna give my

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,279
name

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,039
and i can see myself if i do this i

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
can't see myself it'll show a little

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,279
icon and i could upload a picture um you

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,399
don't need to worry about when you're

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,160
joining the studio anyone's seeing this

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
instantly because you join in a queue

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,160
and you're not added to the live stream

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,399
until the av person clicks it so don't

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,840
worry about muting it's just going to

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
make things more difficult

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,920
so enter the studio

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
when i enter the studio

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
the next thing that i'm going to want to

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
do is i'm going to want to as the

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,840
speaker wrangler

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,879
share

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
the sponsor information

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,960
so you're gonna have two ways that you

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
could do it you could share slides

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
and so we will give you a slide with all

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,560
of the

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
uh speaker in for or the

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,960
speaker logos

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,799
sure

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
so i'll get that

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
and the other option you have is i can

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
share my screen

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,119
this works best if you have multiple

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,079
screens

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
so in this case i could either be

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,720
sharing my screen with the sponsor logos

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,520
or

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
i could be sharing google slides with

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,799
the sponsor logos either one once i am

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
ready i can go into the private chat

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
here and say

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,720
hey i am the wrangler and i am ready

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
once the speaker

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
also says that they're ready the av

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
person will bring

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,680
you in

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
and the sponsor logos um

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
so i'm gonna click hide there so that

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
little banner doesn't show up uh i

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
missed that last year

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
so if you're sharing the screen you can

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
hit hide and then nobody has to see that

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
so this is all the sponsor logos you can

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,400
say like hey

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
my name is nicole i'd like to thank all

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
of our sponsors that you can see here

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
for making this event possible

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
uh we've got

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
after this talk there's going to be the

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
career village panel

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
don't forget we also have one of our

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
sponsors in room xyz doing a raffle

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,200
and

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,319
uh

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,800
in a couple hours from now we have games

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
night so join us to play

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
d among us

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,360
whatever all sorts of fun stuff

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
and now

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
i want to present

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
the speaker who is going to be talking

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
to you about

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
networking and stuff yay

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,319
speaker

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
at this point the av team should

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,519
bring down your stuff

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,519
bring in the speaker

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,480
and then get rid of you

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,360
ta-da now the speaker starts

85
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,239
now the speaker's gonna run out of time

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
so we had one question and it was

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
how do you handle when you don't know

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
how to pronounce the person's name that

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,480
you were just introduced to

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
and you answer it

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
so that's one of the options the speaker

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
may say come on and read the questions

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
so you will have to be keeping an eye on

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,799
that discord channel the q a channel to

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
see incoming questions

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
um you could also give the speaker a

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,400
heads up in the private chat like hey

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
there are no questions so this way they

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,439
know not to

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
save time for that or not worry about it

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
or maybe the speaker doesn't want me as

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
the speaker wrangler reading the

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079
questions out so maybe i would just type

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
at a copy and paste those in there or

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,478
type those in there from discord then

106
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,880
the speaker should answer the questions

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,800
that way so that's it everyone
