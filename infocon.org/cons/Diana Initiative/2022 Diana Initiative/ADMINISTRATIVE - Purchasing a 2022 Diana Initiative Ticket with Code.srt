20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,559
and if

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,079
you're getting a discount then you

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,800
should just be able to pick a discounted

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
ticket for example a discounted human

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
