much for joining me today it is a

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
pleasure to be here and to have the

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
opportunity to speak with you all

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
a couple of years ago i attended my

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,519
first tech conference and was introduced

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,239
to accomplished women in cyber security

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
it was honestly a surprise to see the

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
variety of specializations that led to

70
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
successful careers

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
i was even more surprised to see that it

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
already had skills that were

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
transferable to a role in cyber

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
having this opportunity to network with

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
and learn from an array of professionals

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
made the fleeting notion of a career

77
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,920
pivot real to me

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,239
my initial love was ocean and social

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,680
engineering

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
through networking however i met one of

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,159
my mentors an accomplished professional

82
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,319
in the threat intelligence community who

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,040
would later go on to teach sponsor and

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
advise me

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
as a black woman new to cyber having

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
this support has been very empowering

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,000
when i started to think about submitting

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
an abstract to speak today i really

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
wanted to stay true to my passions and

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,720
to provide something of value to others

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
the diana initiative was the first

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
conference i was able to attend so this

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
moment is incredibly special

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,239
as a result my topic today threat

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,360
modeling your mental health was born

96
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
when i was younger i wanted to be a

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
doctor

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
i later whittled down that interest into

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
working in or around the field of

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,319
psychiatry

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,400
it became a special interest of mine as

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
i love the complexity of the mind and

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,319
the way it works

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
i sought out experiences that would help

105
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,399
me to learn more about the field that

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,798
would also give me opportunities to gain

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
skills and to help others

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,080
consequently i had the opportunity to

109
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
train and get certified as a crisis

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
interventionist

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
to work in a psychiatric hospital

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
supporting acutely ill adults and

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
children

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
to provide direct support to those

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
diagnosed with mood disorders and most

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
importantly to bring strength to and

117
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,160
support family friends and colleagues

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
experiencing a mental health crisis

119
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
over the last 15 years i have been a

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
mental health advocate

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,960
a caregiver and a peer

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
to be effective in a mental health

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,919
setting you must be able to quickly

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
analyze a situation

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
gather information as a crisis event

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
unfolds

127
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
determine the severity of the crisis and

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
implement tools at hand to mitigate

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
damage and to re-establish safety and

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,919
security

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
one moment of hesitation could be the

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
difference between a full-blown crisis

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
and a quiet shift

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,639
a call to 9-1-1 or a call to a therapist

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
a life lived to the fullest or

136
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
remembering a life cut too short

137
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
on the job i learned to read body

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
language to recognize non-verbal cues

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
and pattern behavior

140
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,280
to trust my colleagues to have my back

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
and to jump in when they needed me i was

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
part of a team we had a shared mission

143
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
and we took our responsibilities

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
seriously

145
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
as i continued to explore threat

146
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
intelligence i saw that there were

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
similarities in the skills i honed while

148
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
working in mental health and the

149
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
intrinsic behaviors required to be an

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,280
effective cyber threat analyst

151
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,919
agility critical thinking

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,800
curiosity a love for learning

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
communication and problem solving and

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
leadership qualities were skills that

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
appeared in descriptions for both

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
careers

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
i obviously don't work in healthcare

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
anymore and i am not professionally

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
working as a cyber threat analyst

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
so why am i here today and what does all

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
of this have to do with you

162
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,400
let's look at the last couple of years

163
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
in the last three years we have all

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
experienced an inordinate amount of

165
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
stress and change

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,479
the reality is people are tapped out

167
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,720
the difference i have seen however

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
between those who have been maintaining

169
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
and or thriving and those who are

170
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,280
perpetually struggling has been the

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,080
implementation of an effective plan to

172
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,159
manage difficulties as they arise

173
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,280
individuals who prioritize daily

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
wellness activities were able to

175
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,479
effectively identify and respond to

176
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
environmental stressors and have been

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
successful in remediating and recovering

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
from stress when it occurred

179
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
we become resilient when we recognize

180
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
remediate and recover from stressful

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
situations over time

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
our ability to manage life stressors to

183
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
stay mentally and physically healthy and

184
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
for us to be present in our life and

185
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
active in the lives of our loved ones

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
first starts with the ability to

187
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,080
recognize risks to our mental well-being

188
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,479
we must then be able to determine the

189
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,440
potential negative impact of these risks

190
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,160
and to use the tools at our disposal to

191
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
create an effective strategy to mitigate

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,759
these threats

193
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
let's look at some data

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
according to the american institute of

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
stress yes there's an institute of

196
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,680
stress

197
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,639
about 33 percent of people report

198
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
feeling extreme stress

199
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,039
77 of people experience stress that

200
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,759
impacts their physical health

201
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
73 percent of people have stress that

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,280
impacts their mental health

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
48 percent of people have trouble

204
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
sleeping because of stress

205
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
the global organization for stress

206
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
reports that

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
75

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,559
of americans experienced moderate to

209
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,399
high stress levels

210
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
in the past month

211
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,200
80 percent of people feel stress at work

212
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,880
this is nuts

213
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,640
people who tend to experience

214
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
particularly high rates of stress

215
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
include ethnic minorities women single

216
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,240
parents and people responsible for their

217
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
family's health care decisions

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,120
how many of us fit in two or more of

219
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
those categories

220
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,360
do you see yourself in those statistics

221
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
the recovery village says that once a

222
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,640
source triggers stress various symptoms

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
will emerge unless the person uses

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
effective coping skills to manage the

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
problem

226
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
the most common symptoms of stress are

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
irritability fatigue

228
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,440
lack of motivation or interest in things

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
headaches appetite changes and upset

230
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,640
stomach muscle tension and for some the

231
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,519
resurgence of chronic pain or illness

232
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
stress affects the entire body and is

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
linked to many co-occurring mental and

234
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
physical health problems

235
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
like heart disease

236
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,959
high blood pressure

237
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
diabetes depression

238
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
anxiety

239
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,440
so what about the cyber security

240
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
community

241
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,000
in may tech monitor said that burnout is

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,320
on the rise and that more than a third

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
of cyber security professionals are

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
considering quitting

245
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
in the face of long hours and heavy

246
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,200
workloads

247
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
on june 29th in zdnet it was said that

248
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,279
cyber security leaders are anticipating

249
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,079
mass resignations within the air due to

250
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
the growing threat of attacks combined

251
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,640
with industry skill gaps or perceived

252
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
industry skill gaps

253
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,920
a survey of 500 workers in the us and

254
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,240
the uk indicates that more than

255
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,560
one-third of them would leave due to

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
high stress levels and workloads

257
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,279
negatively affecting work-life balance

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,959
and their mental health

259
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
this is unfortunate

260
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
additional factors that increase stress

261
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
and negatively affect our physical and

262
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
mental health

263
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,760
are

264
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
being on a team that is not diverse

265
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,680
rigid power structures are in place

266
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
and they are not inclusive if a person

267
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,519
feels like they are unable or incapable

268
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,240
of belonging on their team this will

269
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,079
cause problems

270
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
teams that are overworked and under

271
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,839
staffed how many of us knows how this

272
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,720
field

273
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
50 60 70 plus hours a week is not

274
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120
healthy and in the long term it is going

275
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,000
to negatively affect your health

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
opportunities that have a high mental

277
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,920
cost or a high price to get in

278
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,800
studying and taking certifications and

279
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
applying to jobs and not getting

280
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
interviewed and getting ghosted these

281
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
things over time will affect your mental

282
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,760
health it will make you anxious it will

283
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
make you depressed be aware of what you

284
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
are putting yourself through

285
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
cultures where microaggressions

286
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,399
bullying and isolation are common

287
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
control tactics

288
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
the amount of stories that i have heard

289
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,560
from women neurodiverse people

290
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
bipoc individuals talking about work

291
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,040
cultures that minimize their importance

292
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,240
minimize their work and isolate them is

293
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,279
growing

294
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
this is a problem and it's not just in

295
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
cyber security it's happening all over

296
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
in cultures where overwork is praised

297
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
and pto and rest is scorned where you

298
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
feel like a slacker for taking a day off

299
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,319
not okay

300
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
i have received so much from the cyber

301
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,920
security community in the last two years

302
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
a renewed sense of purpose friends i

303
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
consider family and solid plans for my

304
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,560
future

305
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,880
today i want to give back

306
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,360
i will share strategies that i hope will

307
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
help you to better recognize respond

308
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
remediate and recover when you are

309
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
pushed to your limit mentally and

310
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,279
physically

311
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
so let's talk threat modeling what is it

312
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,279
on a high level we know that threat

313
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,600
modeling is a method of optimizing

314
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
network security by finding

315
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,720
vulnerabilities identifying objectives

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,639
and developing counter measures to

317
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,360
either prevent or mitigate the effects

318
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
of cyber attacks against the system

319
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
how can we apply this methodology to our

320
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
mental health

321
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
we want to take a step back and analyze

322
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,720
the threats impacting us

323
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
determine the impact and take steps to

324
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,440
resolve them

325
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,839
first we need to recognize that we are

326
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,639
working with a compromised system

327
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,279
we all have vulnerabilities especially

328
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,240
today

329
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
to respond effectively to a threat in

330
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,199
our environment we must first know what

331
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,600
and where these spots are and have a

332
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
plan before the threat presents what

333
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,639
does stress look like in your life

334
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,120
the recovery village says the top causes

335
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
of stress

336
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
include worries about money or bills

337
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,079
poor work-life balance there it is again

338
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,199
unresolved trauma family

339
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,720
responsibilities toxic relationships

340
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,000
neurodiversity not feeling like you

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,560
belong or fit in anywhere

342
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
personal or family issues job

343
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
instability or difficulties at work

344
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
and personal safety does any of this

345
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
sound familiar to you

346
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,240
let's walk through a system scan to see

347
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
where we are

348
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,120
today

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
how are you feeling

350
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
is it difficult to sleep because your

351
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,920
mind is racing

352
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,639
are you eating healthy food regularly

353
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
and drinking water

354
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,000
are you anxious preoccupied with work or

355
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,839
your relationships

356
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
do you feel sad

357
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,880
or lonely

358
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
do you struggle with chronic pain or

359
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
illness

360
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
do you feel like you are too busy to

361
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
take care of your physical and mental

362
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,360
health

363
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
if you answered yes to any of those

364
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,920
questions having a wellness plan in

365
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
place will help you to find the support

366
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,639
you need with the correct intervention

367
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
when you need it

368
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
mental health is as important as

369
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
physical health so it is necessary for

370
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,160
you to prioritize both

371
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
an effective plan is based on accurate

372
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,839
data

373
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,839
to increase your awareness during this

374
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,360
upcoming week

375
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
take 15 minutes before you go to bed to

376
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
think about how you are feeling mentally

377
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,320
and physically

378
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
keep a journal or take notes in your

379
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,040
phone

380
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
jot down what is on your mind

381
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
write down what is bothering you put it

382
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,720
on paper and make it real so you can

383
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
deal with it

384
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
we all have specific issues that

385
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,120
directly impact us personally that

386
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
predispose us to stress

387
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
throughout my professional career i have

388
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,399
dealt with mentally taxing situations

389
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,120
from sick family members to toxic work

390
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
culture to my own health issues to

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
switching jobs or buying a house and

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
moving

393
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
all of these events put me in a tax

394
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,519
mental space

395
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,079
as i've matured though i now know to

396
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,560
plan for these situations

397
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
i regularly meet with my therapist and

398
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
with my doctor

399
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,399
i reach out to friends

400
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,720
i sleep in on the weekends if i can and

401
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
i spend time outside with my dogs

402
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,759
i silence my phone

403
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,720
i remove i actively remove myself from

404
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,399
toxic situations and interactions i try

405
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,120
to protect my space and my mind so that

406
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
i can manage through challenging times

407
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,320
those who know me for years know that i

408
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,959
will regularly fall off the radar

409
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,839
why

410
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
it's because i need the space to be

411
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,839
better

412
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,480
almost half of all americans will

413
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
experience a mental health crisis

414
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
in their lifetime

415
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,599
you are not defective if you are

416
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,480
struggling you are human

417
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,880
i recognize the ttps that put me at risk

418
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,039
do you

419
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
to get your plan off the ground you will

420
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
need a skilled and supportive team

421
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,520
behind you your wellness team can

422
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
consist of a partner family friends

423
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,160
your therapist a doctor personal trainer

424
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
your dog trainer whoever anyone who can

425
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,039
support you as you begin a deliberate

426
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,520
strategy to maintain good health

427
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
when you are healthy you will show up

428
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
every day in a better frame of mind for

429
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
yourself your children and your

430
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,400
relationships both personal and

431
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
professional

432
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,799
prioritizing your health also supports

433
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,720
those that rely on you

434
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
i know that in many cultures asking for

435
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,039
support from an individual outside of

436
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,400
your small circle

437
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
is looked down upon because personal

438
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
business should stay in the family

439
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,799
some people are also convinced that

440
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,039
speaking out and asking a stranger for

441
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,120
help is not a good decision

442
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,400
this is untrue i received authentic and

443
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,039
educated support from council sought

444
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,000
outside of my friend and family circle

445
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,360
with the distance comes objectivity

446
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,760
you can work with a professional on

447
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
coping strategies and reframing

448
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,520
behaviors

449
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
and also incorporate the support of

450
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
close friends and family

451
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,960
tell them how you're doing share details

452
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
about your plan to get healthy and ask

453
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,520
them to keep you accountable

454
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
it is easy to keep our struggles a

455
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,080
secret and to say that we are fine when

456
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
we are going through challenging times

457
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,799
believe me i know i've done it and i've

458
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,919
been there

459
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
family dynamics culture norms and a lack

460
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,039
of support can prevent you from being as

461
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,200
honest as you need to be to find

462
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
adequate help

463
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,880
now is the time to speak up for yourself

464
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,039
and to act you create the plan for you

465
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,960
you can decide what your accountability

466
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,520
methods will be you must be honest and

467
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
open if you want to receive effective

468
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,799
support

469
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,120
the vast framework visual agile simple

470
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,039
threat modeling involves all

471
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
stakeholders both technical and

472
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
non-technical in the threat modeling

473
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,559
process

474
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
it simplifies participation and is a

475
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
distributed process of shared ownership

476
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
across the enterprise

477
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,480
similarly your plan should include

478
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,360
everyone and anything that will keep you

479
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,678
healthy stable and sane

480
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,520
so what is your plan

481
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,799
in response

482
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,160
to increasing cyber crime data breaches

483
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
insider threats and lack security

484
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,440
hygiene

485
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
companies spend almost one trillion

486
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
dollars in 2021 on cyber security

487
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,559
products and services according to nova

488
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,280
force 2019 security threats and trends

489
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,400
report

490
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,720
smart organizations are getting ahead of

491
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,520
this problem by having an effective

492
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,640
dynamic threat modeling plan in place

493
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,280
as you should for your health when times

494
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,679
get really tough do you even know what

495
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,880
to do

496
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
your wellness plan should include a

497
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
consistent approach that is scalable to

498
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
respond to increased threats to your

499
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
health

500
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
it can include preventative activities

501
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,640
like spending time with your friends

502
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
engaging in your favorite hobbies and

503
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,600
actions

504
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
you can take in critical situations like

505
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,080
checking in with your therapist or

506
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
taking a mental health day

507
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,159
additionally if you find that there are

508
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,559
specific times that are more stressful

509
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,039
for you such as the end of the year or

510
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,200
the end of the month when bills are due

511
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
you can preemptively schedule time to

512
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,720
maintain wellness and to relax

513
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
during this time go take a walk in the

514
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,679
park get a facial have lunch with a

515
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
friend or even spend time alone while

516
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,080
the kids are at school

517
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,400
these actions will fill you back up when

518
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
stress taxes our system

519
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,440
scheduling these activities on the

520
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
calendar gives you a respite to look

521
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,880
forward to and to keep you going

522
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,760
in tough times

523
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
so when life becomes too much how do you

524
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,559
slow things down to create an

525
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,240
environment where you can catch your

526
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,720
breath and focus on yourself

527
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
what benefits do you have that you can

528
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,559
tap into right away

529
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
your company health plan and employee

530
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,080
assistance plan support groups

531
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,799
telehealth appointments wellness apps

532
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,600
and pto are all tools that you have at

533
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
your disposal that can provide you with

534
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
some relief if you've never closely

535
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
reviewed the details of your mental

536
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,280
health balance and benefits commit to

537
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
looking at it this weekend to see what

538
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,440
entitlements you may have

539
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
what is your pto balance i find that if

540
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
i schedule my days off months in advance

541
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,080
it keeps me accountable to take a break

542
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
i have been known to go months at a time

543
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,440
without taking time off from work and it

544
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
physically

545
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
affected me in a very very negative way

546
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,919
you do not want to be there

547
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,640
if you have pto use it

548
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
schedule your time off at regular

549
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,840
intervals even if you have no plans it

550
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
will be difficult to leave amid a heavy

551
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,880
workload and a tax team

552
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,600
if you know that you have a lot of work

553
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,679
on your plate but if you know time off

554
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,760
is coming up you definitely can plan

555
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,919
accordingly

556
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,480
if you are unemployed support groups

557
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
operated by organizations like nami and

558
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,080
dbsa can provide you with a community of

559
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,120

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440

lived experience facilitate discussion

562
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
and provide guidance

563
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
in our communities local libraries offer

564
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,120
free courses on relaxation arts and

565
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
crafts and many fitness studios will

566
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120

567
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,400

568
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
book a yoga or pilates class and go

569
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,120

570

youtube also has a lot of free content

571
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,799
guided meditations exercise routines

572
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,440
even music and language lessons

573
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,480
all of these activities are rejuvenating

574
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
create a space in your world for

575
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
refilling practices

576
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
before stress becomes a problem and

577
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
empties your cup

578
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
define your personal security posture

579
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
know what tools you have in your

580
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,640
possession and know how to respond when

581
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,039
you need help

582
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,919
no one to seek professional help

583
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,240
now that you know how to be more mindful

584
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,799
about where you are mentally and you are

585
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,840
taking stock to evaluate how you feel

586
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,559
what do you do with this information

587
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,799
how do you know when it is time to call

588
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,159
a professional

589
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,240
i'm not a professional so i will tell

590
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,039
you what to do or what you can do

591
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,120
there are a variety of ways to determine

592
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,760
when it's time for a system shutdown and

593
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
a reboot

594
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,840
personally i use a number system when i

595
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,080
wake up in the morning i rate how i feel

596
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,200
on a scale of one to five one is

597
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,640
horrible five amazing if i have a

598
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,960
straight week of ones during the next

599
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
weekend i will actively seek an

600
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
intervention i'll call my doctor if i'm

601
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,919
feeling physically ill if i have a low

602
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,400
mood or high anxiety i will connect with

603
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,279
my therapist i let those around me know

604
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,600
that i am not feeling well

605
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,080
i openly communicate

606
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,440
when i am saying i'm having a one day we

607
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,600
all know what that means

608
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,880
another great method is spoon theory

609
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,279
you can create a system that works for

610
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,440
you you don't have to do what i do look

611
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
at the trends of your behavior and use

612
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,400
the data to make an informed decision

613
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,240
about what you need

614
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
if you need to see a mental health

615
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,640
professional if you are insured check to

616
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
see what professionals are in your

617
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,840
network long-term support can be costly

618
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,400
so choosing a therapist or a doctor in

619
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
network is not only smart but it will

620
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,520
save you money psychiatrists are medical

621
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
doctors who specialize in treating

622
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
mental health conditions and prescribe

623
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,120
medication

624
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,440
psychiatric nurse practitioners are an

625
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,679
alternative to seeing a psychiatrist

626
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,840
they can be less expensive and are

627
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
equally effective therapists like

628
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
clinical social workers and

629
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,480
psychologists with talk therapy will

630
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
provide you with an outlet to explore

631
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,200
your needs to create new behaviors and

632
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
refrain your thinking

633
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
they can also help you to work through

634
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,840
past trauma and coach you through your

635
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
wellness plan

636
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,919
use your first couple of therapy

637
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,400
sessions to determine if your therapist

638
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,360
is a good fit if the conversation seems

639
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,080
forced or you're not comfortable it is

640
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,400
okay to find someone else

641
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,279
check reviews online or ask a friend for

642
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
recommendation

643
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,159

644
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,400
regularly check in with your therapist

645
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
to ensure that your plan of action is

646
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,240

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
better if you need to scale up your

651
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,320
intervention

652
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,679

653
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,640
requesting accommodations from your job

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,039
can start your journey and can take some

686
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,200
ideas away from this talk to prioritize

687
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,679
your mental health

688
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,159
to help you start the process i've

689
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
created a template you can use to draft

690
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,200
your own threat model with a list of

691
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,840
resources for you to continue to explore

699
