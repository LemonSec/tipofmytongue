easy to give advice

but think about your situation when

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,440
you've been in her shoes and how many

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,720
times have you negotiated your offer

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
and when you did

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,519
negotiate

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,920

diana initiative conference as we cover

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,640
such an important topic

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,879
don't settle for less know your value

77
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
today times are difficult

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
inflation is rising

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
things are getting really expensive

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
i can tell you my 100 bills are now 150

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
when i go shopping

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
and it will continue to rise as we see

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
interest rates go up

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
there's a lot going on around the world

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
you heard from the keynote an amazing

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
keynote

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
and we've all seen research and

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
statistics of the pay gap for

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,560
underrepresented groups

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,599
the gap is even wider

91
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
for women for women of color lgbtq and

92
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,480
other underrepresented groups

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
change is taking place

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
but it is slow

95
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
and we need to accelerate it and in

96
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,798
order to accelerate change we need

97
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
everyone's commitment otherwise it won't

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,478
happen at all

99
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
and that's why this year's theme is so

100
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,360
important take the initiative

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,040
and through our talk

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
our hope is by the end of this session

103
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
you'll be able to apply some of the

104
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
learnings to your journey because

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,479
together we can close the gap

106
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
as we share our viewpoints please note

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
that what we share today is our personal

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,639
viewpoints and not of our employer

109
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
so let's start with introductions

113

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
i'm greeting everyone on the call you're

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
all welcome and like hattie said

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
it's been a fantastic journey knowing

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,880
you arty since i came to canada thank

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
you for all you do

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
um i'm a new england grant in canada

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
and you know

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
this topic i'm so passionate about it

131
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
because i know lots of immigrants

132
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
come into the country or into other

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,639
countries

134
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
with the mindset of their country and

135
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
then when they are offered something

136
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
they grab it and they move on right

137
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,319
because

138
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
they still have to compare from where

139
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,919
they are coming from so this topic is

140
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,759
very important to me i'm so glad to be

141

and a little bit about me is you know my

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
network with me as a change maker and my

146
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
purpose is to be a voice

147
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919

148

my entire career to breaking down

149
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
western canada affiliate as well as the

172
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
women in security documentary which is

173
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,160
an exciting initiative celebrating

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,960
amazing stories and moments of women and

175
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,720
allies in our industry

176
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
outside of work i love cooking i'm not

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
the best cook but i enjoy cooking and

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
you'll see me riding my motorcycle so

179
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,120
that's my helmet

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,440
so uh from the video with my niece i can

181
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,319
tell you it's easy to give her advice

182
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
right sure that we were talking about

183
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
this so easy

184
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
and i sent a survey to my network to see

185
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,319
how many chose the option to negotiate

186
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,039
at their existing job

187
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
and if we go into the next slide

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
only you'll see the results only 30

189
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
percent negotiated

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
and i will tell you 20 years ago i

191
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,960
actually was in that 60 category

192
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,000
i did not make the ask because i felt i

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,759
needed the job more than the company

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,199
needed me

195
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
i did not know my value and i was going

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,039
through my as i was going through my own

197
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,240
safari

198
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
i decided well i need to do a little bit

199
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,120
more research am i alone in this

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
are there others like me

201
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,599
who didn't negotiate

202
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
and i got several answers and i'm going

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,360
to summarize it into four categories

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
first is fear

205
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,320
fear of what the employer will think

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
there's that reputational risk or fear

207
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
of rejection

208
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
you know if i don't accept this offer if

209
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
i ask for more they might just take it

210
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,519
away from me and give it to somebody

211
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
else there's that fear right

212
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
and then the second reason is impostor

213
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
syndrome

214
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
a lot of conferences have got some great

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
topics there's one right after our talk

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
about it

217
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,680
and there's

218
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
a lot more like if you asked me three

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
four years ago about impostor syndrome i

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
didn't even know what it was and i'm so

221
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
glad there's a lot of awareness because

222
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,360
at some point in my career i know i've

223
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
experienced impostor syndrome

224
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
and then the third reason of

225
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
what i hear from my research is

226
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,640
assumptions

227
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,200
and the assumptions that you feel you

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,440
need to prove yourself to the company

229
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,399
first

230
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,040
before you can make the ask

231
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,440
and then the last one that

232
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,160
i've heard and i i know it applies to me

233
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
as well is

234
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,880
didn't think about it i didn't know what

235
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
my value was i didn't know what my worth

236
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
is so these are four

237
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,320
reasons that i've heard from my research

238
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
sheriff from your journey i'd love to

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
hear have any of these objections like

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
applied to you or anything that you can

241
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
speak around

242
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
absolutely and while you were doing your

243
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
introductions i realized i didn't

244
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
introduce myself so i'll take a minute

245
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,480
to do that

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,800
so my name is sheriff attacking me i'm a

247
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,880
business information security officer

248
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
with td bank

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
um i have over 12 years experience in

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
cyber security

251
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
and i've done so many things i decided

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,079
to move to canada in 2020 when i decided

253
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,640
that okay this this is the next phase

254
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
for me and my family and i my second job

255
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
with td i've worked with the united

256
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,959
farmers of alberta i currently live in

257
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,040
beautiful calgary calgary is beautiful

258
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,839
in summer and it's been fantastic i

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
mentor women in cyber security um trying

260
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,640
to find their path and trying to make

261
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
all of those decisions because i didn't

262
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,839
get a kind of mentorship uh when i was

263
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,399
trying to find my way and my path in

264
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
cyber security um i'm a mother of three

265
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
um

266
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,600
and married as well and what else about

267
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
me i love to cook just like arty i love

268
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
to travel and i love reading so that's a

269
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,399
bit about me so to your question at

270
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
absolutely i can relate with all of

271
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,760
those questions and coincidentally at

272
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,720
some point in my life i have experienced

273
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,839
it i'll pick on impostor syndrome

274
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
um back home in nigeria at my very first

275
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,839
people managed role with a company

276
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,000
called interswitch interswitch is a

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
fintech company doing fantastically well

278
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,240
in nigeria

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
um they've grown so big now and

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
gone beyond nigeria into africa

281
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
and i was asked um the recruiter reached

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
out to me to come head to the cyber

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
security team back then

284
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
and impostor syndrome came in right

285
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
so even from the application

286
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
i felt

287
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,040
i wasn't ready for the role

288
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
but it took me discussing with people

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,839
specifically with my husband and he said

290
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,760
why not why are you even counting

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
yourself out before going for the job

292
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
interview go for this job interview you

293
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
wave reached out to because they looked

294
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,720
at your profile on linkedin and they

295
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
found something in

296
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
in you and went low and billed i went

297
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,519
for the interview it was fantastic they

298
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,480
were my imagine i said i think you're

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
very good and they offered me the role

300
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,279
right

301
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
so i'm already coming with a mindset

302
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
that oh i wasn't even had to create for

303
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
this job and so when they offered

304
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
i was ready to take the offer right

305
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
but of course again because i always

306
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
talk to people

307
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
that i trust i discuss with my husband

308
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,000
and say why not ask for more money what

309
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
is going to be the worst case scenario

310
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
they're going to say no right and of

311
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
course i asked for more money and it was

312
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,600
a yes so if i had said no i would have

313
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,839
just been there but because i talked to

314
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,720
people

315
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,839
and

316
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,399
i got the advice and that supported my

317
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
application i was able to get the yes

318
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
and and they accepted

319
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,600
my demands and i was able to to join the

320
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
company so impossible syndrome comes

321
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,800
strongly another thing i'll add to your

322
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
to your four points is lack of

323
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
information

324
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
so what i've seen when people quickly

325
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
accept our notifies because

326
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
they either basing it on what they

327
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
currently earn

328
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
and um

329
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,200
they don't actually know their worth so

330
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,839
to your last point so

331
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
i've seen some people just say hey i'm

332
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
cool with 20 percent increase on what

333
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
are currently in you don't even know if

334
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,839
the company is ready to give you 100

335
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
increase the only way you can know is if

336
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
you do the research right so you can

337
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
reach out you you

338
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
the the the major problem is not knowing

339
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
not having enough information and that

340
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,240
can um make you settle for the first

341
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,199
offer

342
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,399
right so yes i can totally um

343
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,880
resonate with what you said all of this

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
point the fear of the job being taken

345
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
away oh my god

346
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,279
they said i'm the first best candidate

347
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
at this interview if i say no he's gonna

348
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,519
go to the second best candidate they are

349
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,279
not gonna meet my demands

350
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,680
but what do you stand to to lose just

351
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
say no you know so

352
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
those would be my additional point to

353
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,880
your points out

354
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,120
that's awesome thank you

355
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
and you're right just to expand on that

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
last point sure you bring such an

357
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
important point on i don't know my value

358
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
and it's interesting because i believe

359
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,639
and many of us will be in that category

360
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,600
too i believe my value was what society

361
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
made me believe what was my value

362
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
and i can tell you one thing is that it

363
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,480
was underrated

364
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
statements like you can't get that role

365
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,320
because you don't have that title or

366
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
you're not good enough made me believe

367
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
that i'm not good enough and that's why

368
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
sometimes we go into that phase of

369
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
undervaluing ourselves

370
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,000
and what we're going to do is

371
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
in the next slide uh we're going to

372
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
highlight as you can see we're going to

373
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
address some of these obstacles through

374
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,160
the five w's the y the who where when

375
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
and what

376
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,600
and as you can see on the right hand

377
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,160
side there's a great statement i saw on

378
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
social media that i thought was very

379
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,199
applicable to our talk which said when

380
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,920
you start seeing your worth you'll find

381
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,000
it harder to stay around people who

382
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,959
don't

383
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
and when i feel low or something like

384
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
that i bring this

385
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
statement back up to to remind myself

386
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
right if someone tells me something like

387
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
that

388
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,920
you're not good enough i bring this back

389
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,800
up

390
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,639
so it's such an important point and i'm

391
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
sure we can all resonate with that

392
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
so let's start off with the first point

393
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,040
um you know let's start with why

394
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,839
why and what is the impact knowing your

395
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,800
value that can have in your journey or

396
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,320
your safari

397
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,079
sheriff what are your thoughts on why is

398
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,560
it important

399
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,079
absolutely

400
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,800
it you need to know your value because

401
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
if you do not know your value then you

402
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
always settle for something less than

403
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,240
your value it is extremely important to

404
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,920
have a plan when negotiating when going

405
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,320
into an offer

406
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,199
if you have a plan then the plan serves

407
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
as your baseline

408
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,759
right

409
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,399
your baseline you've already researched

410
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,600
the company you have researched someone

411
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
with your skill set how much are they

412
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,959
earning you've used multiple resources

413
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,839
including speaking with people

414
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,600
in the organization or similar

415
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
organizations doing similar things that

416
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
you're able to go to at that job to know

417
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,839
an idea of what your hand and i know

418
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,920
this is quite tricky to do right when it

419
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
comes to salaries or conversation

420
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,800
everybody

421
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
does oh sh nobody wants but you can

422
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
simply ask for a range so if you feel

423
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
someone is uncomfortable about telling

424
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,320
you how much the hand that will help you

425
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,199
um

426
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,839
have a plan to know your work ask for a

427
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,079
range okay i'm not asking for the exact

428
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,160
amount could you advise like what is the

429
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,839
rank between this and this that you feel

430
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,000
this company will be able to offer speak

431
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
to people use resources online it is

432
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
extremely important because when you get

433
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,319
that right

434
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,119
you

435
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,599
stand the upper hand when you start your

436
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,559
negotiation you are speaking from a

437
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,520
place of fact so whatever

438
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
cut off whatever offer is being brought

439
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,439
to you're judging it's based on a

440
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
particular baseline so you need to have

441
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
a plan that is your bedrock that is your

442
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
baseline in which you're going to use to

443
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
negotiate if you do not know that then

444
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,360
you would definitely accept anything

445
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,550
that comes your way

446
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,000
[Music]

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,520
yeah i agree great great points and

448
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
to add on to that when you start

449
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,520
thinking about what is your value or

450
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
what is your self-worth

451
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,360
it's not just only about your strengths

452
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
but it's also about believing in

453
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
yourself as i mentioned earlier on is

454
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
understanding also how work plays a role

455
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,559
to your purpose and what are the

456
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
personal values that are important to

457
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,160
you

458
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
right it's important in seeing your

459
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,960
self-worth before others tell you

460
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
because along your journey as i said in

461
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,160
my situation and many people that i hear

462
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
the society may weigh you down and make

463
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,880
statements that you're not good enough

464
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
so people will value you less than what

465
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,600
you really are it is human nature and we

466
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,240
need to challenge that we need to change

467
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
that

468
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,919
you heard from this keynote as well uh

469
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
this morning

470
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,280
and i remember doing this leadership

471
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,240
course

472
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,280
um i think six years back

473
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
i actually rated myself lower because

474
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
that was what i was led to believe and

475
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
when you know your self-worth and your

476
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
value you can address

477
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
the obstacles we talked about earlier on

478
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
which is fear imposter syndrome and

479
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,720
assumptions and it will become easier to

480
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,360
make the ask right making the ask is not

481
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
easy i see some comments over there it's

482
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,039
not always easy it's easy to tell my

483
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
niece negotiate but it's not easy when

484
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,360
you're in those shoes right

485
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,240
and even though we're only 20 or 25

486
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,559
whatever the latest statistic is in our

487
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,760
industry 25 of women we bring a lot of

488
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
value to this industry because of our

489
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
different approach as we see things

490
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
through a different lens

491
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
always remember this

492
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
reason is the reason why you were

493
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
offered that job is because they see

494
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
value in you

495
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
and what you're going to bring to the

496
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,799
organization and we all need to make

497
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,360
sure that the offer

498
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
reflects that

499
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
and secondly it's also important to

500
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
understand the impact that we've seen

501
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
over time which is a compounded

502
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,760
compounded effect

503
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,240
and i'll explain this with some numbers

504
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
i experienced it in my in my own journey

505
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,720
when i was new to the country uh in 2005

506
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,679
and

507
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,640
it took me a while so

508
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
in my safari the guy the gap widened for

509
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
me and my colleagues because i actually

510
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,799
started at a significantly lower rate

511
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,400
and i know that

512
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,640
it's for me in my journey it's taken me

513
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,559
15 years

514
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,880
for me to catch up to where i should

515
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
have been right

516
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
and i know that had i started at the

517
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,960
right level every increase

518
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,159
by now

519
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,360
you know like

520
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,159
you know like from the loss of a lower

521
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,440
package

522
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
i've lost two years of salary right so

523
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
let me let me put some numbers there

524
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
there's a great article from muse where

525
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
they explained it really well two people

526
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
one and they were both offered hundred

527
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
thousand uh in salary

528
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
one person accepted it the other person

529
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,200
asked for a seven percent increase and

530
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
that was accepted

531
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,080
now

532
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,640
let's assume everything's the same for

533
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,080
these two individuals they get the same

534
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
promotions they get the same journey

535
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,799
everything's the same right the person

536
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,520
that started and just assume everything

537
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,200
is applied over a 35-year period the

538
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,240
individual that started at 100 000 would

539
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
need to work for eight more years to

540
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
match the second individual who started

541
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,120
off with the seven percent increase

542
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,559
eight more years

543
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,159
so when you look at those numbers and

544
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,120
stats

545
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
it's interesting just to see you don't

546
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,760
realize you don't realize how much of a

547
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,480
difference or gap it would be

548
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,120
so that takes us to the next one

549
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,919
is who is responsible to close the gap

550
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,320
what do you think

551
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,880
yeah i see and i think you that last

552
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
example you gave was so spot on and it

553
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,159
was so clear for you to see the

554
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,799
difference in you asking for exactly

555
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,400
what you need

556
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
over the years we should all remember

557
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
and like you said that everything that

558
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
will happen to you in that career

559
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,159
journey

560
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,640
really depends on your base

561
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
right so if your base is right increases

562
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
the percentage of the base promotion

563
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
increases whatever it is it's going to

564
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
be a person even for companies that pay

565
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,679
bonuses right it's a percentage of your

566
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
base so if your base is not right from

567
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,600
the onset you're going to be shooting

568
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
yourself in the leg all over this number

569
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,840
of years so great example you gave the

570
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
atti thanks for sharing for sharing that

571
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
i need to go read up um that article i

572
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
haven't seen it uh i'll look at it so

573
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
the question who is responsible to

574
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,480
correct the pay gap this got me thinking

575
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
top of my head i'll just say yeah you

576
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,280
are the one you know you it's your

577
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,360
career journey is your decision it's you

578
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,280
working is you that wants to hand the

579
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
money um

580
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,159
you should be able to initiate i've

581
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
heard of a couple of companies where

582
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
they have very good um

583
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,919
ethics and good um

584
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,559
policies in place that irrespective of

585
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,200
which watch the what they're hearing

586
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,039
they have a fixed amount they're gonna

587
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,400
give for the role

588
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
so even if you are coming with a low pay

589
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,400
and and they find you fit for that job

590
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,120
even if you have asked for a low pay

591
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
they will offer you

592
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
what you actually want what the was well

593
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,559
majority of the company would not do

594
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,520
that so i'm leaving this responsibility

595
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
solely

596
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,440
on the candidate on the delegate

597
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
to ask

598
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
you're responsible to correct that gap

599
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,720
that you've seen you know your

600
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
particular situation

601
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,400
um if you're if you if you unfortunate

602
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
to walk with a low gap with a low pay oh

603
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,360
and you want to carry that on because

604
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,679
you're putting your percentage

605
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,240
on your low pay is still going to be low

606
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
so it's left for you to do the research

607
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,960
and know what you're worth

608
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
and then go for it so i'll say yes while

609
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
i'm tempted to say let's put it on the

610
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
employers to do the right thing but

611
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,799
guess what the employer they want to

612
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
make the best for the business they want

613
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
to hire the best candidate at the

614
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
cheapest rate available but you should

615
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,799
also have your own objective your

616
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
objectives that for your skills in which

617
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,760
you've worked at to to gather over the

618
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
years and the experiences in which

619
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,760
you've worked that together over the

620
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,559
years you want to be paid what is worth

621
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,279
so

622
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,559
i'm not going to leave it on the

623
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,000
employer's end but i'm going to leave it

624
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
on the candidates i'll be interested to

625
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
know what you think arty

626
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,039
yeah i

627
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,960
i can 100 agree with you on that one

628
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,159
it starts from you and um of course we

629
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,559
want to change the way the industry does

630
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,400
operate today that um everyone everyone

631
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
should be responsible and we shouldn't

632
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,960
wait for legislation to happen

633
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,840
i mean

634
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,919
i i've heard statements as well it's

635
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,480
it's not my job that falls under hr or

636
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
that falls under so and so that doesn't

637
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
fall under me i think it should be

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,720
everybody's responsibility uh today it

639
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
isn't uh but again i agree with sheriff

640
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
that start start it with you then right

641
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,720
if it doesn't happen you need to start

642
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,799
that you need to initiate that and if

643
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
you are a hiring manager and you see

644
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,120
that there is an unfair and advantage in

645
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,240
your team's

646
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,360
um pay be a voice because you are in

647
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
that position to make that change

648
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,799
right if you're if you are an employee

649
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,039
back to what sheriff had said make that

650
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,080
ask but ask in a way that matters

651
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,240
and we'll share a few tips shortly of

652
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,799
how you can make those asks

653
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,039
and i would like to add that one of the

654
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,400
things that i've been a big voice for

655
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,640
transparency within organizations you

656
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,360
know

657
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,679
questioning organizations i know many or

658
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,360
companies say hey we fixed the pay gap

659
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,520
but you need to be able to back up your

660
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
statement with that data to share to

661
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
your employees

662
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,320
there are very few companies out there

663
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,799
that have begun sharing data

664
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,559
but i'd like to encourage more companies

665
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,320
to be transparent and share that

666
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,679
sure i've got anything you would like to

667
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,720
add

668
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
yes i would like to heard about that you

669
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,000
know and i'll share an experience one of

670
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,360
the companies

671
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
and you know when we're given our like a

672
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,960
yearly increase letter it was written in

673
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
there to say

674
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
this is confidential information do not

675
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,080
share your bonuses i'm like oh my god

676
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
this is the reason why employers will

677
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,760
continue to have offer hands because

678
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,080
we won't share the information so

679
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,960
putting it in a documented letter that

680
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
way documenting it in a letter in an

681
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,760
official document kind of mixes the

682
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,440
policy so if i discuss my my bonus with

683
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,039
you rt if you're working in the same

684
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
place then i'm going against the policy

685
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
so i'm just wondering why employers like

686
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
to do that is because they want to keep

687
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
you know paying

688
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
the low i don't know whatever but it's

689
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,760
the longest is on you to make sure

690
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,919
you demand for what you want and you can

691
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,000
only demand for what you want if you

692
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,320
have done your research and you truly

693
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,039
know what you want which is the first w

694
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
we have there to see

695
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
why is the importance in what you want

696
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,240
so that every other discussion you have

697
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
will be

698
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,919
will be based on that right because we

699
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,600
have even though employers have their

700
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,520
ways of trying to make salary

701
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,360
discussions or compensation discussions

702
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,480
oh

703
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
there's still something known within the

704
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,279
organization people will talk and then

705
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,159
you get to hear i heard of someone who

706
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,720
spoke with another colleague actually

707
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,399
she thought she got the best of her when

708
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
she joined the company and then

709
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
about few months down she realized that

710
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,159
she was actually at the bottom range of

711
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,919
the fee and she became

712
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,320
totally unmotivated

713
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
she was not happy with the work

714
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
and then she she you know and that

715
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,080
carried on too she eventually left the

716
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
organization right so to to employers as

717
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,919
well you do not want to hire and lose

718
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:54,640
your

719
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,320
your your employees

720
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,399
from the onset

721
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,399
give them what they want right even if

722
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,799
someone is coming with a low with a low

723
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,120
pay request but you know there's usually

724
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
a budget assigned to each row right you

725
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,880
know this person this is the amount you

726
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,960
should be getting or for that it don't

727
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,720
take anything away from the company

728
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,640
because they already made budget for it

729
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
right but if they fail to do that you as

730
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
a candidate you own it you own it

731
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,600
yourself and go ask for what you deserve

732
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,840
yes

733
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,279
i agree

734
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
this takes us to the next topic when do

735
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,799
you negotiate

736
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,760
right

737
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,640
is this at the start is this at the end

738
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,240
and then the second part to that

739
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,760
question is

740
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,399
when you turn down an offer

741
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,240
what are your thoughts

742
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,600
oh interesting so this is a dicey one

743
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,919
right and

744
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,279
um when do you negotiate it's it can be

745
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,440
easily said that you negotiate when an

746
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
offer is made right

747
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,480
but taking a look at this now and you

748
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,360
you actually realize that

749
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
the the process of negotiation starts

750
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
from the first phone call or even from

751
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
the job application

752
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,240
some applications um i think in the u.s

753
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,919
it's quite common

754
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,919
i live in canada it's not very common to

755
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,440
see a job ad that has the salary in it

756
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,799
so they put up the salary already and

757
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
you're looking at it and you're looking

758
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
at what you want to end

759
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,559
and that does not match up you

760
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
immediately turn down that turn that's

761
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,960
down you're turning down at that point

762
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,679
so

763
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,440
you because and you can only turn down

764
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
because you know how much you're worth

765
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
it doesn't fall in the bracket of all

766
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,600
the offer but where this hasn't been

767
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,000
stated when do you then negotiate

768
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,480
from the from the recruitment process

769
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,640
you get a call from

770
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,919
maybe the recruiter or from the hr or

771
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,440
from the hiring manager i've seen

772
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,279
different things happen in some cases

773
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,520
the iron manager calls fest to just talk

774
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,960
to you and see

775
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
even if your feet for her or him or the

776
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,880
recruiter wants to understand your level

777
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,080
of your feet and from that

778
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,159
discussion sometimes they talk about

779
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,559
compensation they talk about salary and

780
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,640
from that point negotiation actually

781
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,480
starts you they so you you ask the right

782
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
questions they talk about what they want

783
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,520
to offer if it meets yes if it doesn't

784
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,919
then you can you can begin to negotiate

785
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,120
from that

786
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
right um there's another school of

787
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
children say oh when you're going for a

788
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
job don't make it seem all about money

789
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
at the first at the first um

790
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
conversation you're having yes i agree

791
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,520
but

792
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
if the recruiter brings it up and say

793
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,399
hey so how much are you looking to end

794
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,320
i'm curious to know aussie what would

795
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,799
you suggest in that case should we jump

796
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,480
and say how much you want to hang or

797
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,840
what do we do

798
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
yeah i mean if it was live and you were

799
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,399
asking me say we're broke playing that

800
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,159
yeah and what my and you're asking me

801
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,880
that question my response just to just

802
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,360
what i typically say is i appreciate

803
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
your question and

804
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,760
what is important to me is transparency

805
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,840
within the organization and i'd like to

806
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,000
hear from you what the budget range is

807
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,480
for this position

808
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,760
we can pause and wait for them to share

809
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,480
and if you're still at the very early

810
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,760
uh spot of your conversations

811
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,159
think about it you know think is this in

812
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,399
line with what your expectations are and

813
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,120
then secondly is you know you're still

814
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,279
early in the sales cycle or what i call

815
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,960
it sales like but the the the

816
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,360
conversations the interview cycle right

817
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
you're still very early stages right you

818
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,519
still need to do homework of each other

819
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,240
so

820
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,399
that's probably not the best time to

821
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,760
start making your negotiations but it's

822
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,919
a good time to understand what the what

823
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,200
the range is so that a as you go further

824
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
along the line uh in the interview

825
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,559
process if they like you you like them

826
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,919
things can change at least you know

827
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,559
what the range is and at least you know

828
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,720
if it is still a little bit under your

829
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
range right if it is a great company it

830
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,440
has other things that you're looking for

831
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,159
as sheriff that mentioned earlier on

832
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,480
it it doesn't have to only be cellular

833
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,519
there could be other things that you'll

834
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
see along the way that are important

835
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,760
so yeah back to your piece uh sheriff

836
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
that i you know just that's my response

837
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,679
at the very start when someone asks me

838
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,279
and you know i love this question

839
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,399
because i'll tell you a really funny

840
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,159
story is i'm in sales and customers are

841
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,799
always always always trying to negotiate

842
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,159
the best deal for the company when

843
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,120
they're buying one of the products

844
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,720
and you know what's really funny is in

845
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,960
this question it's always this question

846
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,360
about how much does this product how

847
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,960
much is this product and it's always the

848
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,919
first question in my first not first but

849
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,679
it's always in that first meeting that i

850
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,120
have with them

851
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,600
and you know when asked i openly share

852
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,000
the range of what our solution is right

853
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,600
and that even though they're not yet

854
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,120
buying they haven't even seen a demo of

855
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,440
the product but they ask those questions

856
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,360
and the good news is that

857
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,039
you know

858
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,840
that some places you you can't while you

859
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,919
cannot that you know like you can't ask

860
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,279
what people make because i know there's

861
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,679
legislation in place where some states

862
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,519
or some countries have that so i know

863
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
during our time they used to ask us

864
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,279
these questions what do you make and you

865
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,440
also needed to prove what you had like

866
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,360
what your offer what your existing offer

867
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,279
is so i'm glad for

868
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,679
some places that has been removed

869
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,039
right

870
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,840
but

871
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,320
you know if you if you see that scenario

872
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,960
right it's the same concept right

873
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
you know a lot of people ask that

874
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,640
question so when you're in an interview

875
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
process you know it's okay to turn it

876
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,440
around turn the table around and ask

877
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,480
them that question and i hear so many

878
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,600
managers

879
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,919
or you know who do ask what is your

880
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,399
salary expectation

881
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,960
you know just just ask them what is that

882
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,120
budgeted right and even if it's less

883
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,559
than what your expectations are if you

884
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
go along and like something about that

885
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,639
company this there's a reason why you're

886
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,079
having those conversations continue

887
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,839
those conversations if it's completely

888
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,359
way off i'm not saying continue those

889
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,440
conversations have those transparent

890
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,119
conversations and let them know as well

891
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,000
so they're

892
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,800
aware of what the industry rate is

893
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,079
because sometimes um that may not be

894
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,320
information that is that is available to

895
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
that organization or they haven't done

896
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,359
their research or they're looking for a

897
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
different candidate that you may not be

898
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,760
the right fit or they might not be the

899
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,520
right fit for you

900
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,719
um

901
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,839
and one other example right i'll share

902
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,918
two stories actually on this

903
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,639
um on when to

904
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,199
negotiate so there are two stories

905
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,800
one is an individual that i asked

906
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,480
recently and i said hey did you or did

907
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,440
you negotiate your existing offer and

908
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
she said no because they asked me what

909
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,320
my range was and they gave me the top

910
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
end of my range and i was like okay

911
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,640
that's great but did you ask the company

912
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,960
what their budget was and so they she

913
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,720
said no

914
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,119
um and i'm like what what if you were in

915
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,079
the

916
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,400
lower range or you know way below that

917
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,359
range

918
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,680
right and that got her to pause and to

919
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,160
think like yeah actually

920
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,760
right and i'm not saying be greedy or

921
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,520
anything like that just see what your

922
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,839
value is and see what what it matches

923
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,920
and then there was another example

924
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,280
um

925
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,240
is

926
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,560
my sister-in-law she she shared this

927
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
example to me she's new in

928
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,920
the u.s

929
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,040
and she was asked um now in her industry

930
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,280
it's very transparent so you can see how

931
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,359
these two conversations very different i

932
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,280
mean similar you can see the outcomes

933
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
very different she was asked the same

934
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,800
question she's like there's this uh

935
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,119
level one level two level three the pay

936
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,400
range was

937
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
clearly visible between the three

938
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
and she was asked this question

939
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
what um level do you see yourself fit in

940
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,160
and her answer was i think i'm a level

941
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,119
one um and i'd like to know more and we

942
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
can assess this towards the end in terms

943
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,760
of the role in the discussions we have

944
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,839
towards the end of the conversation

945
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,320
between her and the manager the hiring

946
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,880
manager during the interview at the end

947
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,560
what happened was

948
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,400
the interviewer the manager said

949
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
actually based now that i know what your

950
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
skill sets are and what you what your

951
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,839
value is what you're bringing to the

952
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,320
table and your experiences and things

953
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,880
like that i'm i feel you're a level two

954
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,359
and so she was offered a job based on a

955
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,880
level two

956
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,680
despite her being um you know despite

957
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,520
her looking into applying for a level

958
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,640
one

959
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
so that's you know that's my thoughts uh

960
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,119
sheriff but anything to add on that and

961
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
i'd like to also hear when do you turn

962
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,599
down an offer yeah great great examples

963
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,880
i'm going to pick up on your first

964
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
example and i think some of the audience

965
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,119
may actually be also have this question

966
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,200
right and is about when you have kind of

967
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,359
committed to an offer

968
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,800
and then you go back to do your research

969
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
and you see that oh i can actually ask

970
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,800
for more can you go back and renegotiate

971
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
right i know it's a situation that can

972
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
be avoided if

973
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,119
uh we took the tip in which you gave

974
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
which means turning back the question to

975
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
the recruiter to say hey what is the

976
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,000
range for this role right but in the

977
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
case where that hasn't been done

978
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,160
and you have given a a value to a an

979
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,119
amount or a figure to to the recruiter

980
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,960
and they latch on to that and then you

981
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,640
go back to do your own work and you

982
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,040
realize oh my i could have asked for

983
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
more what do you think is it advisable

984
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,200
to go back and ask for more would that

985
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,880
not be greedy or asking for too much

986
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,760
yeah

987
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,880
you know it

988
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,200
back to your point as long as you've got

989
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,119
reasons and you've prepared which is one

990
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,480
of our tips we're going to talk a little

991
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,599
bit more about as long as you're

992
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,119
prepared

993
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,760
and you're giving your reasons i know in

994
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
my situation

995
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
um

996
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
it was clear and transparent now i

997
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,160
didn't give what i wanted but it was

998
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,520
clear

999
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,359
to them that at the same time i was in

1000
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,160
other interviews and i was also aware of

1001
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,960
what the market rate is right

1002
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,040
so it again it depends situation to

1003
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
situation yeah can you go back and ask

1004
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,920
it gets harder because you know when

1005
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,440
you've already said this is what i'd

1006
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
want and then now you're going back it

1007
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
can be perceived differently it can get

1008
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,880
harder

1009
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,599
um you know later on

1010
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,160
but if you've got enough compelling

1011
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,320
reasons just like when you are in an

1012
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,960
existing job and you're going to ask

1013
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
to

1014
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,760
get a raise or a pay increase give your

1015
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
reasons and just put your homework

1016
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
together of why you're asking for that

1017
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,119
don't just say i want more because i

1018
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,000
just

1019
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,760
you know

1020
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,320
feel i need more or show that greed just

1021
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,480
do your homework

1022
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,400
okay so i think we can move to the next

1023
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,839
one so where

1024
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,320
do we find resources to know how much

1025
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,920
you're really worth do you want to go

1026
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
for that

1027
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,000
yeah absolutely one thing though just i

1028
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,280
just wanted to highlight the previous

1029
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,320
one with when to turn down an offer this

1030
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,240
is an interesting one and

1031
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,720
just just a quick thing is is that if

1032
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
the company like

1033
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,240
i know i've turned down offers and the

1034
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,720
reason why i've turned down offers is if

1035
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
the company does not align with my

1036
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,400
values and no matter how attractive

1037
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
the offer is i've got offers that have

1038
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,280
been a lot more than what i have i've

1039
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
turned them down and this is something

1040
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,480
that you'll know during the interview

1041
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,839
process

1042
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,760
so like for example i

1043
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
remember one of my interview processes

1044
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,560
where i met with an executive and i

1045
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,800
i saw that um

1046
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
how that executive treated his his

1047
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,079
pa his personal assistant i didn't like

1048
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,880
that

1049
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,280
and so i decided you know that's that's

1050
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
what i'm seeing from a cultural

1051
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
perspective of what the leaders are

1052
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
that's the no no that's a red flag for

1053
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,760
me another one where um

1054
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,599
the other one where i did turn it down

1055
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,560
where

1056
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,319
within the within the organization i was

1057
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,720
asking those hard questions of diversity

1058
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,119
for example like you know um asking

1059
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,720
those direct questions based on what i'm

1060
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,800
seeing from an external perspective and

1061
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,240
everyone within the organization said

1062
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,319
yes we do need to work on our diversity

1063
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,520
and we need to

1064
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,359
um you know uh broaden our um

1065
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,000
our or the way we're going about hiring

1066
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,839
versus just you know who we know and

1067
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,119
things like that

1068
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:31,920
and

1069
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,800
one of the interesting comments that

1070
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,640
when i had gone to the next stage of the

1071
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,960
interview i'd asked to speak to

1072
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,359
one of the executives

1073
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,520
and when i asked the same question and

1074
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
they answered we don't have a diversity

1075
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,400
issue so he gave me two red flags one is

1076
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,079
of course

1077
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,640
the organization thinks differently um

1078
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,040
and there's a clear communication gap

1079
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,079
but it just gets me to understand um you

1080
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,839
know that's a big red flag for me it

1081
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,240
doesn't align with my values

1082
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,480
absolutely and as you are saying that i

1083
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,680
remember recently i got three job offers

1084
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,240
before i decided to go with td bank and

1085
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,880
i'll share that quickly as an example

1086
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,680
and it also both still the first point

1087
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
on knowing your value so when we talk

1088
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,160
about value is beyond just the dollar

1089
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,480
and cents right there's some other

1090
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,280
aspects that really matters to you right

1091
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,240
for me

1092
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,480
it was important that i should be

1093
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
i should have flexible working so i

1094
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,640
should be able to work from home

1095
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,119
and so that was top of my list i had a

1096
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,680
list actually and then i put all of

1097
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,920
these three companies against that list

1098
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,960
and i scored them so took this company a

1099
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,000
company b against my list because of

1100
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,839
these are the things that matter to me

1101
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,920
one of them being compensation at this

1102
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,079
amount another being work for mum

1103
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,000
another being the culture

1104
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,880
um that are actually walking the the

1105
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
talk and not just talking about

1106
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
diversity and inclusion

1107
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,880
um another being you know

1108
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,440
reporting line another being the

1109
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,920
leadership of the company and i rated

1110
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,079
all of this company and when i looked at

1111
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,800
the scores it was clear with facts which

1112
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,359
of the companies i should go for and you

1113
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,839
know that was a personal thing i did

1114
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,520
that helped me to select the job offer

1115
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,599
out of the three job offers

1116
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,680
that i had and i had to turn down the

1117
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,160
remaining two of course politely with

1118
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,440
reasons

1119
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,079
um that i was able to get because i did

1120
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,480
all of those homework i was able to turn

1121
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
down those offers so so yeah so i could

1122
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,680
relate with turning down the offers

1123
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,640
when

1124
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,200
they actually do not meet your

1125
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,400
expectation

1126
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
which in your case he didn't even have

1127
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,160
to do with the money was the way the

1128
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,000
leadership was and the way he treated

1129
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,160
his pa

1130
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,839
yeah it's a no-no definitely

1131
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,319
um yes and back to your question on the

1132
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,040
next part sheriff at is where to find

1133
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,960
resources um yes there's glassdoor

1134
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,040
and there's a lot of information there

1135
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,560
that you can get

1136
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
um you know just googling and things

1137
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,640
like that you know you get employees

1138
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
sharing that you know information or

1139
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,720
salaries and things like that but back

1140
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,280
to your point it's just um

1141
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
take that initiative back to the

1142
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,319
conference theme take the initiative

1143
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,040
i've reached out to my mentors i found

1144
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,720

1148
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,280
these mentors of mine have helped me see

1149
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,119
what i don't see myself and we have

1150
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,440
these conversations and and i asked them

1151
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,359

what you said really echo what you said

1165
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,680
which is

1166
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
it's not just only salary because i know

1167
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,760
i've taken

1168
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
less salary because it's the culture

1169
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,280
that that is very high on the list for

1170
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,480
me it's ins and many times when it's a

1171
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,839
good fit

1172
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,880
trust me the organization will come back

1173
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,400
even if it doesn't meet the expectations

1174
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,760
it will they will come back with

1175
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,560
alternative options like uh more stock

1176
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
option i know in my case it was more

1177
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,119
stock option which which i like and i'm

1178
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,359
okay with that right or more vacation

1179
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,440
days or more flexibility so you know

1180
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,880
there's plenty of places where you can

1181
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,960
find resources for me that what's really

1182
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,000
helped us um my mentors for sure

1183
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,640

1184
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,319

1185
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,400
point in which you made

1186
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
apart from using the numeric sources

1187
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,119
online talk to people right

1188
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,240
in cases where you can find someone on

1189
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
the inside and you could say oh say i'm

1190
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,960
i'm being i'm talking to people in your

1191
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,440
organization about this offer this is it

1192
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,079
this is it what do you think

1193
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,480
is the salary this is what i'm asking

1194
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,040
for what do you think talk to people and

1195
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,800
they will give you insights into this

1196
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,480
information you need to

1197
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,359
to do your research and and in addition

1198
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,160
to all the numerous sources online glass

1199
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
door that can provide salary range

1200
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,400
linkedin and some adverts

1201
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
talk to people network and that's where

1202
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,800
the power of networking comes up if you

1203
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,359
have not built a relationship period to

1204
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,640
that time

1205
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,319
it's going to be difficult for anybody

1206
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,680
to give you this kind of insights right

1207
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,800
and i remember when arty and i met

1208
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,720
in a common group

1209
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,040
for women in cyber security i didn't

1210
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,960
even know i was going to come to nigeria

1211
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,000
to canada from nigeria and getting here

1212
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,640
as he was you know she held my hands and

1213
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,040
put me through but guess what we built

1214
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,400
that relationship years ago before we we

1215
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
really really got i got to canada and

1216
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
she was able to support my journey and

1217
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
we met online right so it connects to

1218
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,000
your networking right network with

1219
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,400
people reach out to people if you're an

1220
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,480
introvert it doesn't stop you from

1221
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,440
networking right and so i just wanted to

1222
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,480
add that that um networking helps you to

1223
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,560
find the right information

1224
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,520
um

1225
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,440
yeah that that you ordinarily cannot

1226
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,839
find online

1227
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,000
that's such a good point on networking

1228
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,880
exactly and asking people right and it's

1229
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,319
you know back to your earlier point it's

1230
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,280
always so hush-hush right and that's how

1231
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
it's been for a very long time but you

1232
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,640
look at some of the other industries

1233
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,680
where my husband works in a credit union

1234
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,040
everything's just so transparent

1235
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,119
everyone knows what they make so why are

1236
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
we hush-hush right

1237
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,880
so i don't know i don't get it it's time

1238
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,920
we start changing changing um

1239
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,160
changing the culture changing changing

1240
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,079
the what has been there for so many

1241
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,160
years as that was the norm we've got to

1242
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,640
change that and challenge it right

1243
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,400
yeah

1244
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,359
yeah

1245
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,800
okay so

1246
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,400
tips okay i i guess i can go go through

1247
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,119
uh tips we've said uh four simple tips

1248
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,960
we'll just share some tips as we go

1249
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,359
along it might be more than four but uh

1250
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,400
hey

1251
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,720
additional tips are always great

1252
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,920
so

1253
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
here you know the first tip i would

1254
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,839
share

1255
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,520
is be fearless

1256
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,200
and make the ask

1257
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,920
i know it's hard in that in that video

1258
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,040
you saw with my uh niece

1259
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,000
right

1260
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,440
i'll tell you something which is really

1261
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,520
funny is and for those who have kids

1262
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,599
nieces or whatever it is

1263
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,559
when

1264
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,319
my niece and even for you in your own

1265
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,760
journey i know when i was younger i'm in

1266
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,559
the same boat about being fearless

1267
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,839
is um you know her her parents have just

1268
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,000
you know been you know yelled at her or

1269
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,319
she did something wrong and guess what

1270
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,160
and i've seen this lie

1271
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,000
and literally after you know she'd be

1272
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,880
told off about something she did uh that

1273
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,400
was wrong

1274
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,440
there's a chocolate on the table there

1275
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,839
and then right after that she goes

1276
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,720
hey mom dad can i have that chocolate

1277
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,559
and i'm there sitting and cringing like

1278
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,400
oh my gosh that's not a question you

1279
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,640
need to ask at this time

1280
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,680
she's fearless because in her head she's

1281
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,040
like

1282
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,800
what are they going to say no no

1283
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,920
and over time

1284
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,200
i don't know where it has this fear has

1285
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,359
injected in our journey because think of

1286
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,000
yourself as that that child

1287
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,680
you know and i know i've been there and

1288
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,319
i've been fearless asking openly despite

1289
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,640
having been yelled at right

1290
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,440
so same concept and i'm saying i'm not

1291
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,480
trying to say be greedy yeah right

1292
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,440
what i'm saying is make the ask but make

1293
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,319
the ask in a way that matters right in

1294
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,440
my career i've seen that 95 percent

1295
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,599
have started off with a lower package

1296
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,000
for those who haven't made the ask and

1297
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
this is where it leads me to tip number

1298
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
two

1299
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,480
which is

1300
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,760
the saying

1301
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,960
fail to prepare prepare to fail

1302
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,119
and do your homework as we were talking

1303
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,119
earlier on rachael i said does he asked

1304
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,720
me that question you know when is it

1305
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,880
right if you have to renegotiate and

1306
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,880
things like that if you're going back

1307
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
to renegotiate make sure you prepare

1308
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,640
make sure you do your homework and find

1309
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,400
out more information

1310
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,559
don't have that don't go in with a

1311
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,559
negative attitude

1312
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,000
focus on your value and align it with

1313
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,079
the company's values you've already

1314
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,839
reached that stage in the interview and

1315
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,319
you have the right to bring your

1316
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,359
feedback

1317
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,160
and you will know from that the company

1318
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,280
culture

1319
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,200
that will give you a good indication of

1320
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,000
how the company reacts to your feedback

1321
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
if you're taking it as a way in a form

1322
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,599
of feedback

1323
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,920
it changes the whole conversation versus

1324
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,400
going with a negative attitude

1325
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,920
and then just one last thing which i

1326
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,960

sheriff

1345
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,640
i'm handing it over to you to hear your

1346
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,720
tips

1347
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,520
absolutely so first and first

1348
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,559
you know don't accept the first offer

1349
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,520
do not accept the first offer like the

1350
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,920
case of your knees with a chocolate bar

1351
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,640
you know she said

1352
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,200
i want chocolate ask for what you want

1353
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,079
and they're gonna say yes or no right

1354
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,520
and

1355
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,559
a company who has offered you a letter

1356
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,640
or offered your position they talked

1357
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,839
about it

1358
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,800
right they are not just gonna

1359
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,880
forget about you because you asked for

1360
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,559
more money they are gonna go into

1361
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,480
negotiation with you they're gonna talk

1362
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,480
about okay can we meet this yes we can

1363
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,160
this is what this is these are the other

1364
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,839
things we can meet and then you can

1365
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,480
choose from that so first things first

1366
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,880
don't accept the first offer when you

1367
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,599
see that offer take a deep breath thank

1368
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,720
them ask for a day or two and you

1369
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,720
provide a response within a day or two

1370
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,280
thank you the offer think to what your

1371
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,720
what because you've done all of those

1372
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,480
research you have the baseline which

1373
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,319
you're working with you think you and

1374
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,160
you're able to then present what you

1375
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,079
want and then they will look at it

1376
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,760
then the the other tip i would share is

1377
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,960
practice right negotiations sometimes

1378
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,559
you need to

1379
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,800
you may get in through some negotiation

1380
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
negotiating discussions and they won't

1381
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,079
be very easy right you need to practice

1382
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,839
if you know you want to go near good

1383
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:26,880
shape

1384
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,960
find someone to practice with and say

1385
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,760
okay

1386
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,079
think of the possible questions and then

1387
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,319
prepare your answers ahead like okay so

1388
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,760
why do you think you want this much

1389
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,800
money go there with facts the skills the

1390
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,319
additional value you're going to bring

1391
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,280
your skills that you've done the

1392
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,079
experiences how much you're worth or how

1393
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,040
much

1394
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
competitors of that company what was the

1395
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,599
industry saying about that position

1396
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,480
practice your negotiation speech and go

1397
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,480
into that negotiation

1398
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,280
very well and then finally i'll say

1399
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,880
know when to stop

1400
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,800
or when to walk away

1401
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,319
so you cannot turn the negotiation into

1402
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,640
a back and forth and then you're going

1403
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,559
asking for 2k

1404
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,800
know when to say okay

1405
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,559
i've hacked for this amount the company

1406
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,480
has come back to say this is what we can

1407
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,280
do

1408
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,680
look at it and say yes i'll go with this

1409
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,960
or no it's a no-no for me and that's it

1410
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,920
so those those would be my additional um

1411
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
tips to what you said i see some

1412
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,680
questions coming in so do we want to you

1413
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,040
want to add anything to that actually

1414
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,359
before we go to the questions i'm good

1415
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,000
let's uh let's go ahead and

1416
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,920
get the questions and then we can wrap

1417
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,240
up because we've got seven minutes yeah

1418
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,240
okay so i can go ahead and read the

1419
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,839
first one says let's say we're

1420
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,480
negotiating they say they have an ad

1421
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,599
stop at so and so price

1422
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,640
what else can be asked for compensation

1423
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,160
i think this is a good question actually

1424
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,559
do you want to give it a try yeah

1425
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,720
absolutely think about what's important

1426
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,079
to you right if it means flexible

1427
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,200
days

1428
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,880
i know there's this whole concept of

1429
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
hybrid working in the office working at

1430
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,440
home is that important to you

1431
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,559
is um the ability to

1432
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,440
uh for example like for in my case stock

1433
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,160
options if it's a private company you

1434
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,559
can negotiate that another one which

1435
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,240
i know in the beginning

1436
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,040
when i first moved to canada from uh the

1437
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,079
uk

1438
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,720
i was so used to 35 days of vacation i

1439
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,000
come here and it's three weeks and i'm

1440
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,160
like what am i going to do with 15 days

1441
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,280
so for me what was important is i needed

1442
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,920
an extra week of vacation because my

1443
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,079
family's back home and i can't you know

1444
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,960
go fly to uk and kenya

1445
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,520
in in those three weeks

1446
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,760
my three weeks is gone right yeah

1447
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,359
and you know that being you know flying

1448
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,200
all the way to nigeria it's a long life

1449
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,960
you've lost four days going i mean two

1450
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,480
days going two days coming back and

1451
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,599
that's gone

1452
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,079
exactly so there's so many different

1453
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,720
things back to think of what is

1454
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,319
important to you

1455
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,119
and

1456
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,400
as you think about what's important

1457
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
whether it's flexible hours or

1458
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,680
hey you know

1459
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,559
on friday afternoons i

1460
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,640
want to finish early or something like

1461
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,079
that and

1462
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,720
have those conversations and ask them um

1463
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,880
you know what what they're willing to do

1464
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,400
for you yeah and in addition you know if

1465
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,319
it's a company that offers stock options

1466
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,400
you can ask for that you can add to an

1467
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,839
increased uh percentage in your bonus

1468
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,079
uh yeah more vacation days like you said

1469
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,480
the benefits right can they do something

1470
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,160
around the benefits

1471
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,920
maybe give you a better benefit if

1472
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,640
dental is not included you can ask for

1473
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,079
that so these are some of the other

1474
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,680
things in which if they've said

1475
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
absolutely no they can't

1476
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,319
add that add more to your conversation

1477
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,760
what are the other areas in which you

1478
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,920
can negotiate everything

1479
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,559
leave days vacation days uh benefits

1480
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,720
stock options whatever they they have to

1481
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,040
provide you can actually negotiate

1482
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,079
yeah

1483
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,520
yeah like for i think in the u.s 401k we

1484
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,760
have it as rsps and things like that

1485
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,440
those are all things that all add up

1486
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,839
right yeah

1487
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,200
so um i see another question here

1488
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,040
i've been pushed a lot to give my

1489
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,000
current salary it seems a taboo

1490
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,799
would you walk away for that practice

1491
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,599
should i give an attempt so

1492
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,280
i will i wouldn't

1493
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,760
depending on the offer rights

1494
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,319
if i'm being pushed to give my current

1495
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,160
salary and from what we said we've

1496
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,160
advised against that

1497
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,480
and they're refusing to give me the

1498
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,079
range of

1499
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,799
whatever that role is worth it tells a

1500
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,280
lot about the company right i'm looking

1501
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,839
back to see okay

1502
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,640
why are you really really pushing for

1503
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,960
for my salary and when i've asked for

1504
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,319
you to give me

1505
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,400
the information so they're pushing that

1506
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,920
first thing first is

1507
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,160
turn the table around flip the question

1508
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,559
to them and say how much

1509
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,799
is this role how much are you willing to

1510
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,119
to to offer for this role

1511
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,000
i think you'll be hard for a recruiter

1512
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,920
or hr or whoever

1513
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,920
to tell you no we are not going to tell

1514
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,319
you we want you to tell us our salary

1515
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,920
oftentimes they'll come back and give

1516
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,839
you a range right and that gives you a

1517
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,000
starting point an idea of where to start

1518
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,359
from

1519
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,000
if they continue to insist and say no

1520
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,599
you have to tell us how much you are

1521
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,720
earning

1522
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,319
i don't think you're obligated to give

1523
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,000
the information and you can say that

1524
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,319
that i i i don't feel comfortable to

1525
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,400
give that information if they do decide

1526
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,319
to take off their offer because you

1527
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,400
don't want to give

1528
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,160
that personal information because it's

1529
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,079
personal information

1530
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,000
you really need to check if that's the

1531
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,760
kind of company you want to work with

1532
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
okay

1533
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,240
yeah

1534
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,160
i agree with you sheriff but i mean i

1535
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,000
would wonder why do they need that and

1536
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,559
they the corner and you into that and to

1537
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,200
your point i was i earlier days there

1538
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,280
was that you know standard people were

1539
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,480
asking that

1540
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,119
um and over time the the key thing then

1541
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,240
back to that interview example uh that i

1542
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,920
used i appreciate your question what's

1543
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,440
important to me is transparency within

1544
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,880
the organization

1545
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,400
and i'd like to hear from you what is

1546
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,720
the budgeted range for this position if

1547
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,400
they were still really pushing you back

1548
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,799
and i would say i would love to again

1549
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,160
back to transparency i'd love to

1550
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,760
understand why this is important to you

1551
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,000
right now at this stage

1552
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,920
you know ask them because this is where

1553
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,599
by asking those questions you're

1554
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,440
actually trying to understand and learn

1555
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,599
the company culture are they transparent

1556
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,559
or not

1557
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,040
and is this the right fit for you or not

1558
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,119
uh again it depends more on that

1559
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,799
situation will you walk away will you

1560
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:43,680
not

1561
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,520
how are they here's how they're

1562
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,440
addressing those answers based on how

1563
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,880
i'm questioning would determine whether

1564
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,160
i'm going to stay or i'm going to walk

1565
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,359
away

1566
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,079
i know we've got only two minutes

1567
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,000
about a minute so the last question is

1568
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,520
what are some good resources for

1569
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,799

1570
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,200
