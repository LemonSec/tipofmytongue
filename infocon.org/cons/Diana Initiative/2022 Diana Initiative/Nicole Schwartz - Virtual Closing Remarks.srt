1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
hello everybody

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,080
all right

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,960
so

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,280
closing remarks and then you all get to

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
go for game night

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,279
our mission is to create a more

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,039
inclusive information security industry

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,880
and we're a diversity driven conference

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,920
committed to helping all

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
underrepresented people in information

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
security

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
we're not for profit and 100 unpaid

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
volunteers everybody that helped you out

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
today everybody that's been working on

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,079
this all year leading up to this is

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
doing it in addition to school in

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,879
addition to their day job and

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,480
we have the same jobs you do we're

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,879
interested in cyber security

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
we have about 27 staff that are

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
currently working the virtual event

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,120
we also had iot village and just hacking

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
games helping out to run some of our

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,079
villages we had 30 volunteers helping

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
out for virtual doing 71 different

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,519
volunteer shifts

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,960
we'd to

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
thank all of our sponsors without them

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,720
none of this would be possible

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
there is all sorts of things that go on

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
behind the scenes whether it's securing

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,920
the licenses for bots on a discord

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
server or buying a stream yard license

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,759
or getting t-shirts for the speakers

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
there's a million little details that go

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
in and a lot of them put in time money

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,799
and promotion to help all of us get here

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
and enjoy this

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,840
so speaking of

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,720
villages we had the career village

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,439
they had one panel with 41 views

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,799
one talk

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,040
and they did about 24 resume reviews and

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,520
three impromptu audio sessions which are

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,399
always

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,479
popular

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,439
we also had a ctf

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
the winners are going to get pentester

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
lab passes i will be contacting them

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,799
probably tomorrow i need a nap after

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,079
this

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
but who are the winners

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,800
well there were 55 players on 36 teams

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
and our top three people were clarks

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,080
purple and

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,800
i'm just gonna go with roxy and i'm kind

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
of confused by the birds are real

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,599
i want to see these birds but anyway

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
thank you to everybody who played it

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
looks like everyone had a bunch of fun

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
we also had the iot hands-on lab there

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,239
was 144

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
lab sessions that's about 73 of the

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
people who were actively participating

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,440
in discord dropped by and tried out a

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
lab so looks like you all enjoyed that

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,879
if you want some more of it and you're

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
coming to defcon you should definitely

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,319
check it out because they've got two new

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,400
labs

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
we also had the maker village

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,599
there was circuits soldering demos easy

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
ada and

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
i believe there were flying things and

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
magnets like i kept popping in there and

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
it was chaos everyone looked like they

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
were having fun learning stuff learning

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
how to use tools differently which isn't

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
that the whole point of hacking anyway

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
by the numbers there was about 168

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
active attendees in discord

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
youtube we had 428 unique morning views

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
116 unique evening views

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
i could not figure out how to get the

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,879
count on twitch or linkedin so we're

86
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
just going to ignore those we had 11

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
speakers

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
with four villages and one lock picking

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
workshop

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,599
code of conduct team had to

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,080
mute somebody warn somebody

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,799
and uh delete one statement so overall i

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
think that was a pretty good success

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
if you would kindly take the time to

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
give constructive feedback to any of the

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
speakers as somebody who has been a

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
speaker at events before

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,920
knowing what i could improve on what was

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,439
unclear

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,159
is beneficial so if you can take that

101
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
couple of minutes to just hit the

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,439
feedback survey button

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,599
i'm sure they and we would appreciate

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,840
that because we also have a event

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
feedback so everyone who is registered

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
will get this through eventbrite

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,839
and uh we'll also post it out on social

108
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,960
media

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,479
so

110
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,960
let us know what was good what was bad

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
you know what ideas do you have

112
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
we learned

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,759
that

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,919
right now is

115
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
kind of rough

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
and you need to connect with your own

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
humanity and align what you do with your

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
own ethics and values

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and that the freedom

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
for all of us

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
is where we're going to find the freedom

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
for each one of us

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
we're all interconnected whether we want

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
to be or not

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
and there's always been times

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
where bad things happen

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
and although there are heroic moments

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
the tide is not changed by that one

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
heroic moment it's many people

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
acting when the situation calls for them

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,680
to do so

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
and

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
it's going to be in day to day life it's

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
not going to be a moment that comes with

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
like a tag in a video game that says

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
this is the moment now you need to act

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,520
and so how do we show up for others

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
we have to be caring

139
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,759
and help people get the care they need

140
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,520
and we have to be compassionate and

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
loving

142
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
and

143
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
in order to do that

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
we learned today about threat modeling

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
our own mental health

146
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
what steps can we take to protect our

147
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
own well-being

148
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
so that we're in a position that we can

149
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
extend that same help

150
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,639
to others

151
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
we learned that you can set achievable

152
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
goals and work toward them just like you

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
would train for a 10k

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
and that can apply to learning new

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
skills in information security it could

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,360
learn

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
you know a new language whatever it is

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
that you want to achieve

159
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,639
you now have the framework for that

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,880
we boosted our skills in android

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
application pen testing

162
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,919
os

163
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,680
cyber threat intelligence and also

164
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
hunting down small pumas

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,919
bluetooth low energy hacking with

166
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,520
monster in the middle

167
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
and utilizing servant leadership to

168
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
build a diverse and inclusive workplace

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
because you can have all the dei

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
initiatives you want if you're not

171
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
walking the talk

172
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,960
then

173
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,719
it's not going to work long term

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,199
and we learned about negotiating and

175
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
understanding your value

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
and of course kicking your imposter

177
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,319
syndrome

178
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,880
to the curb

179
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
so our theme for the entire day was to

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
take the initiative

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
and it's a little tough to do that this

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,520
year uh

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
this is my representation of this year

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
our

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
logo represents

186
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,919
that

187
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,960
we

188
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
can be for fiercely protective of one

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
another and then we're stronger together

190
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
and in the year of the tiger let's go

191
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,599
rawr

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
and take it on as much as we can

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
slowly

194
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,198
together as a pack

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
our discussions were on the ways that we

196
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
could

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
take that

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,880
and move forward with it not only in our

199
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,720
professional life but in our personal

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
life

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
and there's a lot of things that need uh

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,520
something taken on this year

203
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,080
and technology's not neutral

204
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
it's political

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
so think about the ways that we use

206
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
technology the ways technology is used

207
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
by us around us against us

208
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
and when you're designing your products

209
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
or testing your products think about all

210
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,639
of those edge cases

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
so

212
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
on a happier note

213
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
i would love everyone to swing by the

214
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
social channel we have a bunch of

215
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
discord channels set up for free games

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
that we found online that were fun

217
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
if you think we should make additional

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
channels let us know

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,479
we hope everybody enjoys doing the

220
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
