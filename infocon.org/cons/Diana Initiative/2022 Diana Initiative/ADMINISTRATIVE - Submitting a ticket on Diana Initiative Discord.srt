1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,560
okay i'm going to show you how to create

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,320
a ticket on the diana initiative server

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
if you can see all the attendees

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,880
channels click on submit a ticket

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,559
and pick the type of ticket you need to

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,599
submit

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,640
go ahead and click it

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
and then you can type your information

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
in here

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,400
uh let's see

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,359
let's miss that

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,880
here we go

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
general support

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,520
uh this

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
is a test in this case you probably want

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,640
to give them information about uh what

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,879
it is you're having problems with if you

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,640
do a roll request if you're looking for

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,440
a speaker role or something

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
or if it's code of conduct violation say

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,520
who and what channel

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
and maybe include a screenshot if

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,600
possible hopefully that helps thanks
