00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,059
year

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,340
um and so glad to be welcoming viewers

stream yard YouTube LinkedIn and

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,079
probably some other platforms

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,379
a couple housekeeping rules uh we will

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,000
try to keep an eye on all the different

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,040
chat but if you have comments if you

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,560
want to interact do start by going into

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,659
the Discord q a channel that's the one

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,299
that I'm keeping track of as well as the

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,460
stream yard slash YouTube

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,520
foreign

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,500
so my talk today for the virtual TDI

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,900
conference is sharing is caring the

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,259
deeply Human Side of CTI networking

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,840
and today in our talk we'll lay the

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,820
groundwork for some fundamental CTI

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,100
Basics what's the domain who's working

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,380
in it what does it mean and then dig in

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,840
a little bit deeper into research that I

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,000
completed earlier this year and

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,640
published about the human to human

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,979
collaboration the sharing that people

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,979
are doing in order to support their CTI

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,179
program objectives

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,640
all right a little bit about me Tracy

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,140
did a great job in introducing me

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,979
I am three things one I'm the co-founder

45
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,560
and the CEO of pulse dive we are a

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,420
threat intelligence startup that is

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,598
focused on supporting the collection

48
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,660
enrichment uh analysis and automation of

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,120
threat intelligence data across teams of

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,160
all maturity levels

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,379
I also when I'm not working on pulse

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,660
dive love playing really difficult

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,140
really stressful board games and so in

54
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,940
that third bubble you see in the formula

55
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,540
that is a character called spread of

56
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,700
rampant Green in the spirit Island

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,160
Cooperative board game if you have a

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,900
favorite board game drop it in the chat

59
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
I always love hearing and giving

60
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,800
recommendations

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,980
and then finally in the third bubble uh

62
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,660
if I'm not playing board games I'm not

63
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,519
working on pulse dive you can find me

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,000
creating art this succulent pot garden

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,300
is actually a watercolor

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,220
and you can see it here it's real it's

67
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,819
mine and it's watercolor paper in a 3D

68
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,860
pot with stones

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,840
I see somebody said Spirit island is the

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,580
best game and I totally agree and I'm

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,080
excited to play the new expansion that

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,239
came out last month

73
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,739
so anyway

74
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,780
introduction aside

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,780
I wanted to get into the bottom line up

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,440
front

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,180
what I'm here to talk to you about today

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,879
is how CTI networking is an asset and

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,260
not an afterthought

80
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,780
but before we get into some of the

81
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,580
specifics let's get everybody on the

82
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,599
same page and say what's CTI uh there

83
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,980
was some talks earlier today about

84
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,959
intelligence and threat modeling and

85
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,580
that's great because that's all related

86
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,580
but if you want to drop in some details

87
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,620
some phrases that you're familiar with

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,780
related to what you've heard around

89
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,340
threat intelligence

90
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,140
throw it in the Discord now and I see

91
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,840
there's a lot of chatter going on

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,700
I see a lot of people have passionate

93
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,439
comments about board games and I would

94
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,480
like to talk to you after after I finish

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
the presentation

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,860
and another thing that we're going to do

97
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,599
just for a little bit of fun to spice it

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,040
up make sure you're paying attention to

99
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,720
the screen is we're going to have a big

100
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,060
cat Safari and you'll see in the bottom

101
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,920
of my screen here there's one of the

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
Pumas which is from the Diana

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,360
initiatives art this year I asked the

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,340
team earlier they don't have a name for

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,259
it so if you want to give it a good name

106
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,259
a fitting name let me know and I'll try

107
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,979
to refer to it as our new pet and you

108
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,020
can find this Puma on six different

109
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,660
slides in this presentation it might be

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,340
tricky depending on what screen you're

111
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,680
looking at it might be semi-transparent

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
it might be upside down but it will

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,699
always be this cat

114
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,139
foreign

115
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,520
let's get started

116
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,060
so what is cyber threat intelligence

117
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,100
go to any vendor or go to any major

118
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,080
analyst group and you'll find slightly

119
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,060
different definitions

120
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,500
but we'll go with Gartner because

121
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,900
they're a big leader in the space and

122
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,960
they Define threat intelligence as

123
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,639
evidence-based knowledge including

124
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,900
context mechanisms indicators

125
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,639
implications and action-oriented advice

126
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,580
about an existing or emerging Menace or

127
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,940
Hazard to assets a lot of words

128
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,460
this intelligence can be used to inform

129
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,380
decisions regarding the subject's

130
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,080
response to that Menace or hazard

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,660
and no matter where you read a

132
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,400
definition it really boils down to a

133
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,100
couple key components it's data that

134
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,100
gets contextualized that then informs

135
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,840
action

136
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,699
and what's really important with threat

137
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,259
intelligence and where the market is

138
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,380
today is clarifying what threat

139
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,720
intelligence is not

140
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,300
the ones listed here get conflated with

141
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,860
threat intelligence but threat

142
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,960
intelligence is a program it's a process

143
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,139
it takes time so it doesn't mean you

144
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,199
have threat Intel CTI if you have a

145
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,479
notebook with every threat group or apt

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
being tracked like a dossier

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,740
it doesn't matter if you just have a lot

148
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,500
of expensive feeds and expensive tools

149
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,900
it's not having a dedicated team member

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,759
or a provider for threat Intel even

151
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,220
though that's obviously very important

152
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,199
it's not ingesting every indicator you

153
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,180
can find or o-sinting all the things

154
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,759
even though there are great free tools

155
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,699
ocean tools and a lot of research being

156
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,380
done around indicators which are like

157
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,440
domains urls hashes

158
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,139
and most importantly which I alluded to

159
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,100
earlier

160
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,340
CTI is not setting it and forgetting it

161
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,680
it is not something that you plug in and

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,419
then you kind of Let It Go live and

163
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,520
suddenly it's on its own it takes a ton

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
of human intelligence human work and

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,380
curation to make it really work for an

166
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,660
organization but it is that fundamental

167
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,400
layer of knowledge and centralized

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,860
repository for what you're looking at

169
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,680
related to your organization or your own

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
threat landscape

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,039
so now that we've talked about what it

172
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,599
is at a high level

173
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,120
where is it taking place and who's doing

174
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,160
threat intelligence

175
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
most organizations based on a Sans

176
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,860
Institute survey from last year

177
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,780
reported that they had some sort of

178
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,720
formal dedicated team or some sort of

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,819
shared responsibility across security

180
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,560
groups and that could be like secops

181
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,419
incident response

182
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,220
and what you'll see here is that over

183
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,680
half had a combination of In-House and

184
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,919
service provider the amount of In-House

185
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
only CTI teams went up five percent and

186
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,919
became 36 last year so that's trending

187
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,660
upwards

188
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,240
and then there's a small proportion that

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,639
has just service providers so CTI

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,099
Professional Services Consulting that's

191
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,979
doing the bulk of their work

192
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,919
and now this was a snapshot across all

193
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,620
organizations that Sans had surveyed but

194
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,660
what kinds of companies does CTI take

195
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,220
place in

196
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,740
the first are ad vendors these are

197
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,740
products large and small these are

198
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,000
startups uh creating tools or services

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
and this is great because a lot of times

200
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,580
you're at The Cutting Edge you're

201
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
developing new technology you're really

202
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,300
working with a lot of customers and

203
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,039
understanding where the market is going

204
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,560
next and what you need to do what tools

205
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
need to be made to support those

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,979
processes and those people working on

207
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,840
CTI teams

208
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,300
then there's Consulting and that could

209
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,220
be big four that could be small local

210
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,400
msps mssps that have some CTI services

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,500
that are being built out and that's

212
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,360
Professional Services where you if

213
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,519
you're working as a CTI analyst or

214
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,679
practitioner a lot of the times you're

215
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,719
getting paid hourly on certain client

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,000
engagements and they're great to get

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,860
exposure to different environments and

218
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,500
understand the business value behind CTI

219
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,899
but it can be pretty stressful and it

220
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,540
can be challenging working on that

221
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,600
client service side

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,880
of course there are government entities

223
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,240
military Federal local state that are

224
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,640
building out CTI capabilities to protect

225
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,959
their citizenry protect their

226
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,940
departments understand what threats are

227
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,399
facing uh their specific

228
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,920
uh attack surface

229
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,680
and then finally I'll wrap institutional

230
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,160
and Commercial together because that's

231
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,680
traditionally seen as the in-house

232
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,959
security team that means that there's a

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
security team that's protecting

234
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,440
corporate assets or non-profit assets

235
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,540
and that could be for academic

236
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,000
universities and schools Healthcare like

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,660
Hospital networks and then commercial

238
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,220
for-profit companies like Enterprises

239
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,980
right retail Hospitality Finance supply

240
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,180
chain and Manufacturing

241
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,140
but what those teams look like truly run

242
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,640
the gamut

243
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,860
and CTI teams today

244
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,100
and if you can spot the Puma please drop

245
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,080
it in the chat it is hiding somewhere

246
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,399
and I'll give you a clue if I don't see

247
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,519
any notes uh halfway through the slide

248
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,920
but keep an eye on the yellow Puma

249
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,519
CTI teams today run a full spectrum of

250
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,740
maturity that's what they call it CTI

251
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,120
program maturity

252
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,760
there's CTI on a budget which I like to

253
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,540
joke is kind of like the college dorm

254
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,980
microwave and mini fridge built in one

255
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,019
where they're they don't have that much

256
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,880
capacity there's like a single person

257
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,560
who also has a full different job who's

258
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,380
starting to do CTI they rely a lot on

259
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,480
free and open source tooling which is

260
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,459
great and they're just starting to get

261
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,440
their feet wet into researching and

262
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
analyzing threats

263
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
in the middle section which is the

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,140
biggest because I would say this

265
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,540
represents most CTI teams

266
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,180
there's a bit of a messy kitchen

267
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,000
and this is because a lot of CTI teams

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
that have some resources have been doing

269
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,640
this for a few years at cti's grown as a

270
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,899
space

271
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,560
um there's a lot of mess it's not fully

272
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,360
operationalized data connectors are not

273
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,760
fully in place that you might collect a

274
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,140
little free tool here a list of

275
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,540
indicators there some internal Telemetry

276
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,760
here and don't let these phrases throw

277
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,320
you off but you get you're getting a lot

278
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,700
of stuff but it's not all necessarily

279
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,399
working together smoothly and there can

280
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,860
be depending on how the organizations

281
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,380
addressed their CTI program and maturing

282
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,600
it a lot of like a graveyard of missed

283
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,100
projects or things I didn't quite meet

284
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,320
their full potential so with CTI it's

285
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,820
important to understand

286
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,880
assess Where You Are the kind of next

287
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,579
one-two steps you really need to hit

288
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:28,079
strategically and then go from there and

289
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,959
iterate over time right it's not set it

290
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,519
and forget it

291
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,899
finally

292
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,079
mature fusion centers this is the

293
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,440
Iron Chef Master Chef Kitchen where you

294
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,019
have all the tools they're fancy they're

295
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,180
on a show because a lot of times these

296
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,820
really mature teams are not only doing a

297
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,800
lot have a lot of automations have a lot

298
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,440
of talent to support their own teams but

299
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,180
they're producing and sharing research

300
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,120
that gets pushed out either publicly or

301
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,060
within certain groups to support each

302
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,420
other cross sector cross company

303
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,360
and they're they're still always work to

304
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,880
be in this is not a solved problem

305
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,620
whatsoever

306
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,899
but they tend to have most of their

307
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,100
stuff together and have been doing this

308
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,380
for a long time financial sector is a

309
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,300
really good example where there's been a

310
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,040
ton of investment because of the

311
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,839
criticality of the assets that are

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,820
protecting

313
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,560
I see somebody from Healthcare is in

314
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,839
here makes sense given your your uh

315
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
Discord tag name

316
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,820
and at the bottom I had put a few

317
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,500
different phrases you'll see a lot

318
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,680
related to CTI tools and kind of how you

319
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,899
Niche down there's reporting there's

320
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,180
internal data there's dark web data

321
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,100
sector you can be sector-specific

322
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,740
Geographic specific you can do Mana TTI

323
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,220
you can enrich your CTI and like a lot

324
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,100
of fields in security there's a lot uh

325
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
no one can do everything and it's very

326
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,300
important to be able to rely on others

327
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
and draw from the network potentially

328
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,740
using osint feeds to stay on top of the

329
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,959
news to understand what you're doing so

330
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,540
understanding the fundamentals extremely

331
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,680
important

332
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,220
but do not feel overwhelmed if it's just

333
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,660
a ton

334
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,079
so has anybody found the Puma in the

335
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,360
slide yet I'll give you five more

336
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,880
seconds and I will let you know that it

337
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,920
is hiding somewhere in the mess of the

338
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,579
middle kitchen

339
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,160
I see some typing happening in the

340
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,680
Discord so I'll give you a few moments

341
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,620
okay it looks like nobody found it

342
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,100
it's right here up in the cabinets and

343
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,120
that's kind of what it'll look like

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
throughout the slide deck

345
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,160
so I gave the lightest briefest most

346
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,240
high level introduction to CTI if you

347
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,740
listened and you're not fully familiar

348
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,199
or you want to dive in a little deeper I

349
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,699
have some resources for you highly

350
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:03,839
recommended

351
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,420
and hopefully the moderator will be able

352
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,920
to drop some of these links in the chat

353
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
these four URLs you don't have to go

354
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,100
around taking screenshots and trying to

355
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,620
do OCR text recognition

356
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,660
the first if you are

357
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,420
just familiarizing yourself what CTI

358
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,579
what does it mean to work in CTI I would

359
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,220
recommend Katie's five cents this is a

360
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,100
medium that has FAQs on getting started

361
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
and some self-study plans very uh easy

362
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,079
to follow

363
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,480
the second if you're like give me more I

364
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,880
want all the readings I want a GitHub

365
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,279
repo with a bunch of resources I

366
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,380
recommend curated intelligence CTI

367
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,260
fundamentals and that link will cover

368
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,899
not just Theory but in practice and for

369
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,639
Enterprises

370
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,160
finally if you are the type like many

371
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,440
security folks who are like give me all

372
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,839
the tools I want all the things paid

373
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,760
free Frameworks books links uh channels

374
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,000
go to awesome threat intelligence this

375
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
is compiled by Herman slatman it's been

376
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,380
around for a long time and it's just all

377
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,300
the things if you want to open up 75

378
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,160
tabs and kind of feel your way around

379
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,560
CTI from the inside

380
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,560
and finally one of the most recent

381
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,420
additions I made is something mandian

382
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,959
published a month or two ago and its

383
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,480
core competencies for analysts if you

384
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,740
are like hey

385
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,079
um what does it actually mean to do CTI

386
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,220
analyst work

387
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,800
it's often not entry level there are

388
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,019
some out there but what what skills do I

389
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,060
need to position myself for a career in

390
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,060
CTI to to get myself the competencies uh

391
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,860
this is great and it's ungated thank you

392
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,720
to Mandy and for putting it together and

393
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,100
it'll tell you things not just like

394
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,620
getting you specifics about like what it

395
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,300
means to understand threats or produce

396
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,399
intelligence and reports but also what's

397
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,259
effective communication in terms of

398
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,420
business and then it lays out some

399
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,100
scenarios that you can read through and

400
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,899
it's it's it's a lot of words but it's

401
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,180
not very easy to follow with like four

402
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,180
core pillars for the CTI analyst and I

403
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,019
love that they're trying to push

404
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,100
together the development of CTI Talent

405
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,899
and thank you for adding those links for

406
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,639
us in the chat and this is in the

407
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,420
Discord chat

408
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,720
so why bother why did I do research

409
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,380
about CTI sharing to be frank a lot of

410
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,600
the security community and the industry

411
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,940
always talks about how Cutting Edge the

412
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,339
technology is how fancy how new shiny

413
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,440
Technologies and coming from a vendor

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,420
coming from pulse dive I do think it's

415
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,060
highly valuable but I also think that a

416
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,579
lot of times we don't pay attention to

417
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,980
the more manual the less shining less

418
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,959
Cutting Edge things that teams are doing

419
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,959
all the time to support their CTI

420
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,000
programs

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,699
and so when you look at Sans Institute

422
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,100
same survey from 2021

423
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,779
you'll see that the amount of

424
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,480
organizations that were producing or

425
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,420
consuming CTI went up to 85 percent from

426
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,360
60 five years prior

427
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,640
and the amount that had no plans

428
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,260
whatsoever went from 15 to zero so

429
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,660
nobody no organizations that responded

430
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,419
to the sand survey said yes that CTI

431
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,980
thing I just I don't think it matters

432
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,720
for us we don't need to work on that we

433
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,059
have other stuff

434
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,520
and the obviously the remainder the ones

435
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,959
that weren't starting Apple planning two

436
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,599
were made up the other 15 so the amount

437
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,880
of effort being put into both creating

438
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,980
and consuming threat intelligence has

439
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,480
gone up it's only going to continue to

440
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,880
go up but the problem is by no means

441
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
solved

442
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,660
and if anyone can find the Puma on the

443
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,100
page I'll give you a couple seconds

444
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,059
before we move on

445
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,960
so

446
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,179
CTI is growing the field itself has

447
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,000
expanded significantly

448
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,740
and

449
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,380
a lot of tools have come out and they're

450
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,840
very important and a lot of new Talent

451
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,100
has entered

452
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,940
but why would I bother looking at

453
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,179
threat Intel from the human to human

454
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:07,620
one-to-one networking oh I see somebody

455
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,780
in here said see the Puma in top middle

456
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,460
oh a couple of you caught it excellent

457
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,919
yes very faded good eye I see some

458
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,299
screenshots in the chat too that's

459
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,120
amazing keep doing that if you put the

460
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,460
first screenshot in the Discord and I

461
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,740
know your name I will send you a sticker

462
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,500
pack but you'll have to DM me as well

463
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,240
afterwards

464
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,100
good eye

465
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,660
okay

466
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,080
back to the conversation so CTI is

467
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
growing as a field

468
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,980
but you'll hear a lot of

469
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,679
comments like CTI networking is untapped

470
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,980
in organizations we're very siled uh

471
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,660
when it comes to intelligent sharing we

472
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,059
need better ways to share intelligence

473
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,120
safely cross sector cross geography

474
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,919
cross

475
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,440
private you know companies collaboration

476
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,900
is essential for us to do our work and

477
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,460
why does that matter the most important

478
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,260
thing is that at the end of the day you

479
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,360
hear that people will say we never get

480
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
to our level of threat intelligence

481
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,320
maturity of awareness of being able to

482
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,539
act proactively and preventatively if

483
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,679
we're always running around with our

484
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,080
heads cut off working in little silos

485
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,940
with our hands tied behind our back

486
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,700
because we can't share

487
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,640
so what I did and that's exactly what I

488
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,840
looked like when I was going about this

489
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,640
research I have you know the the

490
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,620
spyglass

491
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
um is that I went off and benchmarked a

492
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,559
couple behaviors in CTI sharing from a

493
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,600
very human perspective

494
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
one thing I wanted to be clear about is

495
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,679
that I did not talk about networking in

496
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,360
the sense that you might be familiar

497
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,240
with like getting a new job getting a

498
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,860
promotion closing a deal with a customer

499
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,720
not that kind of networking it had to be

500
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,700
sharing stuff for the benefit of your

501
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,919
CTI work

502
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,559
it also was not about any specific

503
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,320
tooling uh we did not have any interest

504
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,200
talking vendor to vendor or be you know

505
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
we want it to be very solution agnostic

506
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
and so we avoided any talks about

507
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Automation and Intel sharing but there

508
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,620
was a lot of work that was done in

509
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,140
standardization like

510
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,059
and there's a ton of research it's not

511
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,919
like I'm the first one here that looked

512
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
at how collaboration can be improved

513
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,780
from a policy level about trust

514
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,760
um and about Technologies

515
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,640
but to me nobody had ever gone deeper

516
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,520
than crowd wisdom around oh yeah how are

517
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,780
people sharing where are people looking

518
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,360
and really put some numbers behind it to

519
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,520
support the value of what it's doing

520
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,900
right now

521
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,720
so I did three things one is I looked at

522
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
how different methods stacked up which

523
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,100
we'll jump into then we looked at how

524
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,260
and why individuals were participating

525
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,940
why did they bother spending their time

526
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
in their precious resources to do

527
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,960
networking and then finally really

528
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,240
quickly the role that organizations

529
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,440
played

530
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,340
if any

531
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,460
and I'll let you know now there is a

532
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,620
puma somewhere on the screen this was

533
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,940
not one of the harder ones so I'm sure

534
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,400
somebody will be have an Eagle Eye

535
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,980
but my method about going about this

536
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,880
research

537
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,360
was in pretty much following the

538
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,400
intelligence cycle so I started with

539
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,440
planning and Discovery I did a ton of

540
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,360
research to find out what was and wasn't

541
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,580
in scope what people were curious about

542
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,500
I see somebody already spotted the Puma

543
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,780
that was really fast

544
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,159
um I looked at what the purpose of my

545
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,620
research would be started doing some

546
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,299
academic literature research and seeing

547
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,380
what was out there

548
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,659
there's some great research existing

549
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,840
uh then there was collection I built out

550
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,220
the survey which you'll see screenshots

551
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,860
of and maybe a little cat or two then I

552
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,840
distributed that and it was mostly done

553
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,600
through word of mouth no compensation uh

554
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,179
was offered so it was all free on my own

555
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,880
time and time then I moved into

556
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,700
processing and Analysis so

557
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,799
I had a survey it was pretty long so

558
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,780
thank you to everybody who responded

559
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,020
and it was like all the pivot tables in

560
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,580
the world if you're in CTI you're

561
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,740
familiar with Excel it was like the it

562
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,720
felt like the biggest Excel sheet with

563
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,400
so many so many tables and so many

564
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,919
different values and breakdowns but not

565
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,900
just quantitatively

566
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,059
um I also did qualitative review because

567
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,039
I had some open-ended questions so that

568
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,840
helped me layer insights and narratives

569
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,020
on top of the numbers that I was seeing

570
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,840
finally I went out and I'm disseminating

571
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,240
it it came out as a report we'll have

572
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,799
the links later and if the moderator

573
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,419
wants to drop it in chat now you could

574
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,100
take a look it's ungated you don't need

575
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,720
to share any information with me to

576
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,460
download the research that I completed

577
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,980
came out as a Blog and then I've been

578
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,780
doing some presentations to help spread

579
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,159
the word and share the advice and

580
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,640
insights that I found with the the uh

581
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,740
and I see there's some uh

582
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,539
argument going on I'll have to go back

583
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,460
and audit and see who see who won this

584
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,659
the spotting the the Puma

585
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,700
and before we dive into the insights I

586
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,039
really wanted to cover demographics when

587
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
you do research it's important to know

588
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,940
where you might have biases where your

589
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,740
survey was limited and I want to

590
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,380
emphasize that this research is very

591
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,120
much so an initial step it is not

592
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,860
scientifically significant I don't think

593
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,659
I'd have the resources to do that on my

594
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:13,380
own

595
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,659
but it is to give us a sense of what's

596
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,280
out there so we can start talking about

597
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,480
it

598
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,039
and when we looked at our survey

599
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,700
respondents I didn't collect any like

600
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,860
race age gender data I wanted everyone

601
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,720
to feel very comfortable but I did ask

602
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,100
about their roles and their

603
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,539
organizations

604
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,360
what we found here is that

605
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,240
um most people were you know half CTI

606
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,700
dedicated practitioners or related roles

607
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,559
that made a lot of sense like incident

608
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,720
Response Security operations

609
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
start hunting other research and that's

610
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,720
as hope for the years of experience also

611
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,919
made a lot of sense there was a good

612
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,960
spread of people with total work

613
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,179
experience so that could be that they

614
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,980
pivoted from a different field

615
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,860
and then the years of total uh sorry the

616
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,320
years of CTI specific experience

617
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,600
that was also as expected and you'll

618
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,100
look here and be like well so many

619
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,840
people only had one to five years why

620
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,340
why is that the case

621
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,260
and that's because CTI is a growing

622
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,440
field the term CTI is relatively new so

623
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
even if you did CTI related

624
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,860
responsibilities before you might not

625
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,200
report that as CTI work and you'll see

626
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,240
that it's heavily new and then it fades

627
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
off over time and this makes a lot of

628
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,740
sense because people have pivoted from

629
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,200
other roles in security as well as other

630
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,320
careers all together from education to

631
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,679
business analyst work to journalism

632
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,440
and because CTI is so Dynamic and the

633
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,940
programs itself require so many

634
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,140
different types of talent working

635
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,820
together and complementing each other's

636
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,860
skill set uh that's actually a great

637
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,580
thing to see too

638
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,179
and then when we looked at the types of

639
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,039
organizations that's where we had some

640
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,740
limitations on this survey the vast vast

641
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,740
majority are for-profit so half of the

642
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,260
vast majority 41 were in-house security

643
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,539
teams so you're protecting your

644
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,860
corporate

645
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,720
um oh and I see that LinkedIn live

646
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
stream stopped after four hours so

647
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,679
please if you are on there before pop

648
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,799
into the YouTube link

649
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,360
so

650
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,000
um for-profit was split between in-house

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,559
security teams as well as security

652
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,659
providers these are vendors Professional

653
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,700
Services I would have loved to get more

654
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,559
government respondents but it's really

655
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,360
tough a lot of times they're not allowed

656
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,620
to participate even though it's fully

657
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,659
anonymous

658
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,159
um when we looked at organization size

659
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,320
the spread was pretty solid across

660
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
different companies just less than 100

661
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,640
to over a hundred thousand

662
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,360
and then uh finally with location we had

663
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,240
a strong strong majority which makes

664
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,340
sense based in the US as well as Europe

665
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,960
a little bit from Asia some

666
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,940
representation across the board but

667
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,080
that's because it came through you know

668
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,880
my network and it was written in English

669
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,039
we weren't able to translate the survey

670
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,480
but it's something that I would love to

671
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,299
do more of in the future

672
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,400
so let's dive into the fun stuff the

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,020
findings now that all the disclaimers

674
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,410
are out of the way

675
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,140
[Music]

676
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,360
one thing that's not directly related to

677
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,179
CTI networking that I love sharing was

678
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,059
how satisfied respondents were I didn't

679
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,900
find any specific correlations between

680
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,340
sub-groups of people responsibilities

681
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,840
org size

682
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,700
um with the level of satisfaction but I

683
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,620
love sharing this because this is

684
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,360
consistent with what I hear anecdotally

685
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,600
that CTI people enjoy their job it's not

686
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,000
always easy it's not even always fun but

687
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,740
it's very satisfying the type of work

688
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,900
you're doing and it was over 70 percent

689
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,240
there was a slight dip at those that uh

690
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,820
10 to 100 000 employers full company

691
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,440
employers not just the team that would

692
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,240
be crazy if there's a security team of a

693
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,740
hundred thousand people

694
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,480
um and that is just a matter of

695
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,940
organizational culture and growth so if

696
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,679
you're thinking about a career highly

697
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,059
highly recommend you think about it

698
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,679
build up some skill set and take a look

699
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,020
at CTI as a very serious place that you

700
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,520
could bring your security work

701
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,380
all right and there should be a very

702
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,140
obvious cat in the picture for you here

703
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,559
so Jump On It chat

704
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,159
what we looked at when we dove into what

705
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,900
methods how did different methods stack

706
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,820
up against each other we asked questions

707
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,559
about like peer-to-peer chess groups

708
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,120
that's like Discord where we were today

709
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,240
slack telegram signal lots of channels

710
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,620
um there's social media and public

711
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,559
forums so that's Twitter it's Reddit

712
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,240
it's LinkedIn things that can be

713
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,039
accessed publicly

714
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,220
there's one-to-one direct messages

715
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,740
DMS calling you emailing you and then

716
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,020
there was also industry events like a

717
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,460
b-sides like a Diane initiative

718
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,039
volunteer groups and coalitions uh like

719
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,559
Trace Labs or national Child Protection

720
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,500
task force paid membership groups uh

721
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,860
like Isaacs and dark web so I asked how

722
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,080
often do you participate and what we

723
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,720
found is that there are no shortcuts to

724
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,100
the strongest and most effective

725
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,299
networks yet

726
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,399
these are all free the top three

727
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,200
peer-to-peer social media one-to-one

728
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,179
direct messages they're all free they're

729
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,679
all peer-to-peer and they're really

730
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,960
heavily based on personal reputation and

731
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,059
contribution what you do not necessarily

732
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,039
who you're tied to

733
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,840
but that doesn't mean that the other

734
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,760
you'll find that the other channels

735
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,820
don't help they help you create a

736
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,380
pipeline to the right groups that you

737
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,480
want to get into that are more easily

738
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,820
accessible like events and volunteer

739
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,178
groups

740
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,620
and so the crowd favorites and by crowd

741
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,059
favorites I'm you know in general if you

742
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,440
looked at Twitter the conversation

743
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,240
pretty much rang true

744
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,100
so peer-to-peer trust groups one-to-one

745
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,960
DMS and social media I'll explain the

746
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,480
asterisk later led the pack across all

747
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,220
responding groups

748
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,720
but not only did I ask about

749
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,940
participation so like how much do you do

750
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,200
this thing how much are you in this

751
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,700
network but I also asked about

752
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,860
perception and I was asking questions

753
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,380
about key characteristics of CTI content

754
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,740
do you think that it is valuable that

755
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,000
what you get out of it is high

756
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
confidence it's timely actionable is it

757
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
unique content that you're getting

758
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,720
and what you'll find in this metric is

759
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,520
that peer-to-peer trust groups one to

760
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,320
one one-to-one direct message is obvious

761
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,880
first that makes sense but it's also

762
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,860
manually intensive peer-to-peer trust

763
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,360
groups are really strong and social

764
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,360
media really volatile because it's

765
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,899
pretty timely it's valuable but it's

766
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,000
also very low confidence not that

767
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,100
actionable and not that unique

768
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,980
and I think a lot of this issue with

769
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,380
social media is because it comes with a

770
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,880
lot more than what is professional work

771
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,399
you can get all sorts of crazy feeds you

772
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,659
can get distracted there's a lot of

773
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,940
noise and the tip that I heard here is

774
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,919
really learn how to use Advanced muting

775
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,559
blocking following certain lists and

776
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,960
curating based on the objectives you

777
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,240
want you can have a separate personal

778
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,000
and work or research following CTI

779
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,940
account and really make sure that you're

780
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,159
finding just the researchers just the

781
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,320
voices just the Intel that is highest

782
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,880
confidence to you

783
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,860
and most valuable right

784
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,840
because finally even though perception

785
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,000
of social media wasn't so hot compared

786
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,460
to some others the results showed that

787
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,480
yes

788
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,880
social media along with of course the

789
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,799
top two peer-to-peer trust groups and

790
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,539
one-to-one direct messages

791
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,360
they helped real world scenarios I asked

792
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,760
did participating in these help you

793
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,620
detect or prevent an attack

794
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,960
did it help you during an attack did it

795
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,340
help you during remediation or

796
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,620
post-incident analysis and so forth so

797
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,299
we looked at how much people were doing

798
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,039
things what they thought about it

799
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,620
subjectively and then more or less as a

800
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,360
proxy for objective results what

801
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,880
happened and so when you're looking at

802
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,640
CTI networking the crowd favorites took

803
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,159
first place and second place and third

804
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,240
place

805
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,620
foreign

806
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,539
and then I asked all right regardless of

807
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,820
Channel why are you spending your time

808
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,480
in these spaces and when I asked I got a

809
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,299
ton of feedback that said hey I want

810
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,519
actionable and timely content I want

811
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,620
concrete stuff and I'm going to stay for

812
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,600
the awareness of that to help me

813
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,419
contribute to my program uh to my team

814
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,519
my workflows so they want valuable

815
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,559
threat data they want to stay aware of

816
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,480
what's Happening strategically take

817
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,940
proactive measures and also find and be

818
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,740
aware of new sources and methods that

819
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,640
they can

820
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,399
contribute to and bring in

821
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,179
but when it came to the long argument of

822
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,740
data versus information versus

823
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,580
intelligence

824
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,440
what was the highest value really

825
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,419
dependent on what kind of role you were

826
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:37,620
in

827
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,120
and

828
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,860
for the eagle eyes out there who are

829
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,080
actively searching for the Puma there's

830
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,158
another one on this page

831
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,380
when I asked about different types of

832
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,840
content that provided the most value I

833
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,240
forced the respondents to order rank

834
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,760
them and overall which is consistent

835
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,279
with the CTI uh primary job

836
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,860
responsibility

837
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,760
contextualized information came first

838
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,279
then processed intelligence and that's

839
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,039
like a report without insights incomes

840
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,159
remediation tactics reasons then raw

841
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,919
data so like a list of uh technical

842
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
indicators Atomic indicators IP

843
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
addresses hashes signatures

844
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,059
then others advice and opinions

845
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,100
technical support and emotional support

846
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,140
some people joke like why would you put

847
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,419
emotional support on there but when I

848
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,580
did my initial Discovery this was a

849
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,740
reason why people joined the networks to

850
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,360
know that other people are struggling or

851
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,399
during long 4J that everyone was working

852
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,779
together and it made them feel less

853
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:37,980
Alone

854
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,019
um but very much so

855
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:42,539
not the most important right just what

856
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,820
we learned actionable concrete timely

857
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,340
data content is what they want

858
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,620
but how that works out it actually

859
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,720
matters a lot because when I broke it

860
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,600
down just by incident response

861
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,519
raw data was first they wanted stuff

862
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,899
right now that they could look for in

863
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,580
the middle of the incident while

864
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,679
contextualized information like Trends

865
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,279
patterns Behavior profiles were tied for

866
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,559
second last right

867
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,059
and then when you looked at security

868
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,659
operations so stack Ops uh that

869
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,419
completely flipped so number one was

870
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,220
contextualized information back up top

871
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,919
process intelligence while raw data was

872
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,840
dead last because what does secops do

873
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
with raw data it a lot of times becomes

874
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,340
false positives or forces you to do a

875
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,140
ton of research to then enrich and

876
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,000
contextualize the data so that is not

877
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,799
highly valuable so you have to always

878
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,240
keep in mind

879
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,460
Who You Are

880
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,140
who you're working with what these

881
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,760
groups have and how you can contribute

882
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,860
meaningfully

883
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,720
and executive leadership of course no

884
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,279
surprise here process intelligence

885
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,419
number one they need to know what

886
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:46,679
happens why and what they have to do

887
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,840
about it whereas like the raw data and

888
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,399
the technical support drop

889
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,919
and so you can dig into my report

890
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,140
further to see how the years of CTI

891
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,480
experience size of organizations will

892
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,980
also change these rankings

893
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,260
and then finally in organizations

894
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,079
what role do organizations play in CTI

895
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,418
networking and sharing if any

896
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,679
for now

897
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,739
it's mostly on you uh

898
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,079
when I ask questions about at the

899
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,699
workplace

900
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,159
employees practitioners had said that

901
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,440
their biggest barrier by far was time

902
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,199
not having enough time and I think that

903
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,780
this is consistent with any other

904
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,980
project there's just not enough time

905
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,719
there's a lot to do a lot of research a

906
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,239
lot to work on but then the second the

907
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,820
third and the fourth reasons that were

908
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,980
top ranking were all around sharing

909
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,179
restrictions

910
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,020
and what I mean by sharing restrictions

911
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,179
is like legal liability okay I can't do

912
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,699
this because the legal team will not

913
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,639
allow it it's TLP traffic light protocol

914
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,040
that determines what types of

915
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,599
information you can share with what

916
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,160
level of group whether it's just your

917
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,780
team just your organization just your

918
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,760
sharing group or public TLP white

919
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,460
anything on Twitter is TLP White

920
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,680
and then finally there's a reputational

921
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,240
issues

922
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,040
um liability or like ndas and

923
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,260
confidentiality agreements as well so

924
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,700
not having enough time and then not

925
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,260
being able to share even though you

926
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,300
might want to were major reasons why

927
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,839
they were not doing more of it

928
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,820
there was limited reporting when I asked

929
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,859
do you measure your success do you talk

930
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,480
about what you do through networking

931
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,220
that didn't really take place it was

932
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,780
underdeveloped compared to a lot of

933
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,900
other security UH responsibilities

934
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,640
and then this was reflected in the

935
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,619
statements that I had asked

936
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,300
um I asked questions that were personal

937
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,579
like I encourage those who report to me

938
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,680
to participate CTI networking is

939
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,540
essential for doing my job CTO

940
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,920
networking is a part of my time and

941
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,780
responsibilities and how much people

942
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,820
agreed were pretty strongly in the agree

943
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,859
range they felt that it was important

944
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,140
that they agreed but then when you broke

945
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,700
it out by the more organizational

946
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,160
statements like I'm rewarded for

947
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,380
participating in CTI networking it's

948
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,000
easy to get new networking methods

949
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,640
approved CTI networking is defined and

950
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,920
structured in my area of work that's

951
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,720
where it kind of fell towards much more

952
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,820
neutral sentiments and that's because a

953
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,280
lot of people simply will do the thing

954
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,500
and not have it be attributed to the

955
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,640
fact that there aren't parts of these

956
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,900
groups and that these groups are

957
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,700
providing data they just bring it to

958
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,780
their work and then they get their

959
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,740
results

960
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,440
a caveat is that in the cyber security

961
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,660
dedicated Technologies vendors

962
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,400
Professional Services those

963
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
organizational sentiments moved a little

964
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,420
bit more towards agree still not as

965
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,339
strong as the personal statements but

966
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:38,040
that could be a factor of the culture

967
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,720
and understanding about the importance

968
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,420
in Sharing for security

969
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,660
and so here while there's a lot of

970
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,640
barriers and while people aren't really

971
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
measuring or talking about the efficacy

972
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,560
of participating in CTI networking right

973
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,500
sharing stuff in channels like Discord

974
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,680
it directly impacts Top Line objectives

975
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,640
of strategic awareness of action taking

976
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,820
action of taking preventative measures

977
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,800
of mediation

978
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,480
um and I see somebody in chat since I

979
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,000
love CTI networking good to have you

980
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,980
with us if you have any additional

981
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,020
commentary feel free to drop it in the

982
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,640
chat

983
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,619
um and if we just can start to

984
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,480
acknowledge the impact that it already

985
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,579
has in the programs in place today and

986
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,920
be more transparent that can give us a

987
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,619
lot of room to be more intentional more

988
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,020
inclusive to everybody who's looking at

989
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,940
the CTS base and more strategic about

990
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,280
what we're doing and how and how to

991
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,680
optimize that for what your organization

992
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,230
needs

993
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,900
[Music]

994
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,700
so a couple key takeaways as we're

995
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,779
wrapping up the presentation

996
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,520
CTI networking is important for team

997
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,140
members at all level

998
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,660
is as important in my survey this was

999
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,599
the highest consensus throughout the

1000
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,099
entire questionnaire and there was like

1001
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,099
hundreds of quite or 75 to 100 separate

1002
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,060
questions

1003
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,000
there was 91 agreement on the statement

1004
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,160
and that only went up with the more

1005
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,320
years of direct CTI experience and the

1006
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,960
more years of total work experience

1007
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,599
one thing that I caught in the

1008
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,220
challenges that I didn't put in my

1009
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,859
survey though that was reflected in the

1010
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,839
open-ended part was that imposter

1011
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,640
syndrome stops a lot of people

1012
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,800
this year there's a lot of talks around

1013
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,839
imposter syndrome and do you want to

1014
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,359
nail the advice home about how we can

1015
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,700
accept that understand it and then also

1016
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,859
work around and through it

1017
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,900
so I want you to take the advice of

1018
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,579
current practitioners these are quotes

1019
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,440
from people who answered a question

1020
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,180
about what advice would you give others

1021
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,500
in the field

1022
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,080
from people working in the field

1023
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,579
[Music]

1024
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:48,720
it's to participate to build trust and

1025
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,820
always be careful and strategic

1026
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,740
the theme this year is take the

1027
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,420
initiative right and that doesn't mean

1028
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,000
being deeply uncomfortable doing things

1029
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,920
you don't want to do but if you have

1030
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,079
that interest here's a few tips on how

1031
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,960
you can get started and do it in a way

1032
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,300
that optimizes for success

1033
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,180
so to participate start small

1034
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,720
share what you can have both human so

1035
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,079
coffees calls messages and automated ioc

1036
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,540
sharing interactions

1037
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,579
don't let imposter syndrome stop you

1038
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,200
engage from engaging and that's what

1039
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,640
somebody in the chat is saying as well

1040
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,760
that in and of itself is not enough but

1041
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,800
how do you kind of reduce that fear that

1042
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,960
anxiety get involved in a good Community

1043
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,820
it could be a co-worker you like that's

1044
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,740
in CTI it could be somebody that you see

1045
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,240
posting stuff that you resonate with

1046
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,180
that feel you know like they're aligned

1047
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,800
with your values and you can start

1048
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,480
following them and then if you're not

1049
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,180
even ready to put stuff out there right

1050
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,859
like if you're doing some research but

1051
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,359
you're not ready because it's really

1052
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,280
scary to get that first blog or that

1053
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,140
first post about something related to

1054
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,520
CTI

1055
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,740
start by finding and following people on

1056
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,079
social media or those public forums that

1057
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,060
are already working in your target areas

1058
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,800
surround yourself by the discourse

1059
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,660
follow the news understand the language

1060
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,640
understand what people care about so you

1061
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,680
can build that confidence that you know

1062
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,480
we don't have to be experts but we can

1063
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,540
be very familiar with the space

1064
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,119
the second piece is to build trust trust

1065
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,740
is important in security but in threat

1066
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,140
intelligence it's like essential you

1067
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,060
have to be active to develop that trust

1068
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,339
for you individually and also your

1069
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,680
organization can impact your reputation

1070
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,280
and if you burn trust it is so hard to

1071
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,300
recover so always be trustworthy

1072
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,900
um

1073
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,480
you will get into the top circles the

1074
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,940
most Cutting Edge researchers the just

1075
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,040
the smartest people who are just kicking

1076
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,780
butt in their fields by contributing

1077
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,880
your own intelligence there's nothing

1078
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,880
wrong at all with like retweeting dark

1079
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,280
reading or regurgitating but that does

1080
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,680
not separate you and that does not make

1081
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,880
you stand out as somebody who's

1082
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,920
contributing to the space and as we

1083
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,839
learned earlier personal contribution

1084
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,420
and reputation is so essential to

1085
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,280
advancing a CTI career through

1086
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,839
networking

1087
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,260
and a big piece about developing trust

1088
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,380
is also as in CTI intelligence right is

1089
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,940
the name of the game so make sure you

1090
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,560
have good critical thinking your

1091
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,760
conclusions are based on sound

1092
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,300
principles make sure that you understand

1093
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,280
where your biases are where your

1094
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,640
limitations are CTI because the pace and

1095
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,619
the scope of what's being done it will

1096
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,660
never be perfect it will never be fully

1097
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,000
up to date it's a work in progress but

1098
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
acknowledging where those are and making

1099
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,660
sure you're not being distracted and

1100
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,460
you're not holding yourself to really

1101
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,500
high Professional Standards that will

1102
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,760
help you

1103
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,579
and another piece is to provide value

1104
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,980
with the niche you're experienced in

1105
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,500
you saw earlier that crazy spectrum of

1106
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,480
all those terminologies about different

1107
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,060
sectors about dark web about so many

1108
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,099
apts and different types of scams and

1109
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,599
frauds taking place

1110
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,880
you don't have to know everything but if

1111
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,280
you can contribute your own existing

1112
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,740
skill set lean into it and provide value

1113
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,020
with some sort of Niche and that could

1114
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,099
be

1115
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,800
translating across five languages that

1116
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,359
could be writing Python scripts that

1117
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,400
saves everyone a lot of time that could

1118
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,160
be really writing amazing reports that

1119
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,740
translate technical content into stuff

1120
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,420
Executives will care about and take

1121
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,880
action on those are all value in the CTR

1122
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,339
world so if you start doing that and

1123
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,160
then being able to provide that value

1124
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,440
you can also lean and be symbiotic with

1125
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,180
other people who will be able to provide

1126
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,160
their own expertise and answer your

1127
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,359
questions when you hit something you

1128
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,800
don't fully understand

1129
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
and so being trustworthy sounds really

1130
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,119
simple but it takes a lot of effort and

1131
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,780
it takes a lot of

1132
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,280
holding yourself to high Professional

1133
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,660
Standards

1134
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,180
and then finally stay careful and

1135
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,339
strategic understand what your

1136
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:51,960
organization needs

1137
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,000
so that means that you can go out and

1138
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,480
spend all day months weeks years being

1139
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,460
in these groups but if it's not aligned

1140
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,680
to your job it doesn't matter and so you

1141
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,780
want to understand and be clear on those

1142
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,520
use cases what your intelligence

1143
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,800
requirements are you want to have a

1144
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,660
collection plan that includes this type

1145
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,160
of sharing and the content you're

1146
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,200
ingesting from a Discord or from a

1147
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
Twitter that can be automated that could

1148
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,260
be manual

1149
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,000
because data on the floor is useless

1150
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,980
well you know if you don't do anything

1151
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,359
with the content you're spending time

1152
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,160
participating in other than maybe

1153
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,200
emotional or technical support it's not

1154
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,060
going to have an impact

1155
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,520
and then trust but verify there are

1156
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,500
cases where people were spoofing threat

1157
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,720
researchers for reconnaissance or for

1158
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,760
whatever their other malicious means so

1159
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,619
you want to make sure that who you are

1160
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,380
networking with is vetted and that what

1161
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,480
you're sharing and what you're putting

1162
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,220
out there is correlated with the amount

1163
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,960
of trust you can put in those other

1164
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,839
audiences or with these other people

1165
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,819
and I really appreciated the person who

1166
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,300
said be skeptical with data shared of

1167
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,280
course hold yourself to high standards

1168
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,200
but also be generous to those who share

1169
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,780
as it can take a lot of courage and be

1170
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,760
novel if it's the first time somebody's

1171
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,839
out there they're not they don't have

1172
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,579
malicious intent maybe they're newer to

1173
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,800
the space and they do something that is

1174
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,420
not great

1175
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,119
if it is worth your time you can go and

1176
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,280
provide constructive criticism but

1177
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,960
understand and a knowledge that they are

1178
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,920
trying

1179
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,000
um if they're not if they're doing

1180
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,200
something bad that's a whole different

1181
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,180
story but we want to create a space

1182
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,700
where it's comfortable and people who

1183
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,680
are now leaders in their field are

1184
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,300
reposting old blogs saying these were

1185
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,280
the mistakes that I made to try to help

1186
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,960
others and I think being transparent

1187
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,720
about this understanding the limitations

1188
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,920
understanding when something's not the

1189
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,839
best or being open to Improvement is

1190
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:40,800
absolutely essential in CTI

1191
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,440
and then time is the most limiting

1192
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,839
factor right so select the trust groups

1193
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,720
based on impact not just trust groups

1194
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,640
but anything you're participating in

1195
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,460
there are more than enough channels in

1196
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,200
this world more than enough places you

1197
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,880
can join in groups but if you're

1198
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,940
struggling to find Value early move on I

1199
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,099
personally recommend having maybe two

1200
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,079
not more than three channels that you're

1201
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,300
really actively contributing to you're

1202
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,920
keeping track of you're following what's

1203
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,319
going on you feel like everything that's

1204
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,780
coming out of there is probably relevant

1205
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,099
and that what you're putting in there is

1206
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,140
also helping the group and then from

1207
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,460
there you can have other channels as

1208
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,260
well and they can change over time as

1209
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,720
your role and your company changes but

1210
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,400
don't spend too much time stretching

1211
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,619
yourself too thin especially with

1212
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,119
imposter syndrome you might feel like

1213
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,260
you want to see what's going on

1214
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,300
everywhere but then that value isn't

1215
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,160
coming to you at the end of the day so

1216
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,220
prune prune learn how to just focus on a

1217
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,800
couple key priorities based on what is

1218
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,619
providing you value

1219
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,660
and I think we have we're right around

1220
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,020
45 minutes perfectly on time

1221
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,180
and so for closing out and we can ask

1222
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,339
questions here as well

1223
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:54,119
um my full report once again ungated is

1224
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,819
on this uh link underneath I think if

1225
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,260
you can drop the link in the chat as

1226
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,359
well Tracy that would be amazing

1227
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,400
the QR code I promise you leads to the

1228
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,660
report

1229
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,859
um and there's one last Pretty Kitty on

1230
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,060
this page

1231
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,640
if you can find it I will send you I

1232
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,920
will mail you some stickers and if you

1233
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,819
wanted to get in touch

1234
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,740
you can email me you can follow me on

1235
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,599
Twitter and you can connect with me on

1236
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,300
LinkedIn and the links were just dropped

1237
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,940
in the Discord so feel free to add those

1238
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,380
connections

1239
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,599
um if you found something in if you

1240
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,940
found a cat then please also let me know

1241
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,319
who you are if your name is different

1242
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,940
than what's in the Discord

1243
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,520
and uh let's take let's open it up for

1244
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,380
questions Tracy

1245
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,599
any questions that I should cover

1246
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,530
[Music]

1247
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,160
these screenshots are hilarious I love

1248
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,599
that some of you aren't also taking

1249
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,980
direct screenshots because you have like

1250
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,540
a phone or something on the side for

1251
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,640
Discord and then so you have like these

1252
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,940
like skewed shots um that's amazing I'll

1253
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,260
try to see if I could get the second

1254
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,000
fastest person too I'll have to look at

1255
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,800
my sticker Stash from pulse dive and see

1256
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,700
see how many we have left

1257
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,780
okay so we have a question in the chat

1258
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,119
saying have we collected demographics

1259
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,180
based on age so we did not I did not

1260
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,359
collect any of those like uh really

1261
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,280
specific demographics like what gender

1262
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,880
what age what race are you but it was a

1263
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,980
really interesting question that I got a

1264
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,260
lot of early on because the point of

1265
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,140
this research is to help be more

1266
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,300
inclusive but at the same time I didn't

1267
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,740
I wanted everyone to feel very

1268
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,420
comfortable sending in the response

1269
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,980
fully fully anonymous

1270
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,559
and one of the questions I got after one

1271
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,480
of these presentations was

1272
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,980
um I'll go back up as well

1273
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,339
when we were looking at the level of

1274
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:00,780
participation right

1275
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,700
social media was top but then it was

1276
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,280
kind of it wasn't consistently you know

1277
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,740
the best and somebody had reached out

1278
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,599
saying do you think it's because

1279
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,119
potentially younger Generations younger

1280
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,040
professionals are participating in

1281
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,319
things like Twitter whereas the older

1282
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,359
folks who've been around a lot longer

1283
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,579
were more inclined to do direct messages

1284
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,160
where potentially you know they were

1285
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,700
hypothetically asking that you know

1286
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,040
teens 20s year olds might not care about

1287
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,520
DMS because that's old school

1288
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,859
sorry I didn't mean to call anyone old

1289
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,740
but when I dove in afterwards and I

1290
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,319
still have all the pivot tables right I

1291
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,900
still have all of this research what was

1292
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,440
interesting is that was not true uh that

1293
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,660
was not true at all the csos the people

1294
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,819
on Executive teams the people with 15 20

1295
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,980
plus years of experience were as much

1296
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,380
participating in social media as the

1297
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,700
rest so there was no significant

1298
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,980
difference at all maybe a deviation of

1299
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,380
like five ten percent and on the other

1300
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,619
side too when it came to the people with

1301
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:06,780
like less than five years of experience

1302
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,640
I think they had participated A Little

1303
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,400
Less in one-to-one DMS but by no means

1304
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,800
was it significant and same with five to

1305
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,599
ten years or you know those intermediate

1306
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,859
stages

1307
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:18,839
because I think in the beginning you

1308
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,940
might not have that those many people

1309
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,619
that Network

1310
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,680
of experts or Specialists that can

1311
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,079
provide you valuable CTI content and

1312
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,520
that's something where you can benefit

1313
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,940
by volunteering joining these groups and

1314
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,280
uh really building that pipeline for

1315
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,200
those Specialists that oh when when some

1316
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,880
sort of Bear shows up in the news you

1317
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,980
know who to ask oh when this type of

1318
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,960
technology or this type of exploit comes

1319
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,400
out you know who to ask and that's where

1320
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,200
one-to-one DMS can help save a lot of

1321
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,420
time and be very curated but it's

1322
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,220
extremely manual and people complain

1323
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,020
about how long and how intensive it

1324
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,819
takes but there is still the benefit

1325
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,380
right what we see here is that it is

1326
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,960
obviously taking the lead and that it's

1327
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,520
not something to sleep on or complain

1328
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,140
about

1329
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,680
foreign

1330
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,200
s from the group as we are wrapping up

1331
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,599
now I see a lot of people and being

1332
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,700
nostalgic and feeling old and by no

1333
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,920
means are you old it was just a question

1334
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,900
asked by one of our viewers

1335
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,460
one person asked a really interesting

1336
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,280
question about being an Asian woman in

1337
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,900
the I.T community in the security

1338
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,359
community and does that mean people

1339
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,700
don't take me seriously

1340
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,059
um I will be honest here that there have

1341
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:45,660
been specific cases where I don't think

1342
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,880
I was taken seriously by a specific

1343
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,500
subset of groups even potential

1344
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,960
customers right that

1345
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,980
um

1346
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,280
would kind of even though I was leading

1347
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,319
the meeting not necessarily let me lead

1348
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,900
the meeting but by far this is very

1349
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,440
minimal and I do think that I do have I

1350
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,780
I'm lucky to have a co-founder role and

1351
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,920
a CEO role which might help avoid some

1352
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,800
of the challenges for different types of

1353
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,480
diverse groups and underrepresented

1354
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,040
groups in the space that might be

1355
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,480
building up their career from being like

1356
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,640
a CTI analyst a security analyst moving

1357
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,500
into manager competing for the Russell

1358
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,619
role so as the co-founder we're lucky at

1359
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,599
Pulse ad that we could just not work

1360
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,460
with people that we don't particularly

1361
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,819
think are the right types of people who

1362
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,579
would not respect me and also really

1363
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,500
establish relationships and build

1364
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,480
foundations with the types of groups

1365
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,520
that we support and we think are doing

1366
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,160
great work if you want to talk about

1367
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,680
this further uh specifically one-on-one

1368
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,960
I'm happy to share some experiences with

1369
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,540
you happy to share some

1370
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,700
um tactics and techniques that I have

1371
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,059
learned myself to really cut out the

1372
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,339
noise cut out a lot of the negativity

1373
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:02,400
not get really drawn down by the stuff

1374
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,800
that's not great because it you know to

1375
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,960
be honest it does exist still this

1376
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,460
industry has its challenges like every

1377
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,900
other industry

1378
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,700
um and then really stay focused on

1379
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,280
helping the people that you

1380
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,099
trust that trust you that respect you to

1381
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,819
be successful

1382
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,099
that was a good question and then one um

1383
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,599
other one that we got is what should

1384
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,260
people take away from this so

1385
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,599
depending on

1386
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,059
what level of familiarity you have

1387
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:36,180
I would say if you're looking at CTI as

1388
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,859
a career space

1389
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:40,819
we'll go back up

1390
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,880
all the way back up

1391
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,980
if you are saying CTI seems kind of

1392
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,579
interesting start looking at Katie's

1393
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:53,700
blog FAQs on getting started just start

1394
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,400
doing some research if you work in

1395
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,780
security operations or you're someone in

1396
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,880
an i.t-ish role and you're like CTI

1397
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,319
could be something that's interesting

1398
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,319
more than this I would say that you can

1399
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:12,480
follow along with the closeout

1400
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,460
how you can start participating how you

1401
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,440
can find a good Community get those

1402
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,660
people follow the right people on social

1403
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,020
media to keep an eye on

1404
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,940
what's going on in the space and find

1405
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,680
opportunities that might not exist in

1406
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,480
the traditional like LinkedIn job search

1407
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,460
or Indeed job search wherever people are

1408
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,780
looking for these days

1409
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,000
the CTI network is also very strong

1410
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,579
where you can find a lot of interesting

1411
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,680
opportunities have conversations and be

1412
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,900
able to find really interesting roles or

1413
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,280
at least hear about the good roles that

1414
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,140
are out there and the types of employers

1415
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,880
that are maybe not the best or what

1416
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,319
teams are struggling and what those are

1417
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:51,000
to be honest and prepare yourself for

1418
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,040
success and so CTI as an individual you

1419
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,559
can do work uh in the traditional

1420
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,020
organizational sense but you can also do

1421
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,420
and get a lot and like accelerate your

1422
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,640
career by having your own blog setting

1423
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,020
up your own honeypots writing your own

1424
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,599
reports creating commentary

1425
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,180
um making more intense types of content

1426
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,280
legible and easy to consume for others

1427
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,280
so there's a lot a lot of ways to do

1428
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,380
what you're comfortable with and start

1429
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,440
to create value in this very Community

1430
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,660
Driven space there's a lot better

1431
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,880
there's a lot of for-profit teams but at

1432
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,079
the end of the day what I love about

1433
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,079
security is how

1434
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,160
Grassroots it still is and Diana

1435
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,140
initiative is also a great example of

1436
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,319
this

1437
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,900
and so I'm really good to wrap up unless

1438
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,480
there's any other questions I see that

1439
