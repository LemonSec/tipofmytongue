1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,799
hi everyone this is nicole and i am

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,879
doing a little video about how

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
we at diana initiative are going to do

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,960
our hybrid or apologies our virtual

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,160
speakers

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,679
this year

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,279
so we'll give you a stream yard link

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
which when you click it it'll say

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
processing and then it will ask you for

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,279
what your display name is make sure you

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,119
put in what you want the audience to see

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,199
this doesn't need to be your legal name

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,640
or whatever it could be your handle

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,238
whatever you're known as and you want

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,239
the audience to be able to see

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,480
you can see that it shows up here

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
you can see right here that it says my

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,280
mic is working

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,559
and we can see me here you could mute

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,440
but because you enter into a queue

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,000
that is not necessary

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
so what's going to happen is first

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
you're going to join a green room just

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,199
so you can test out your mic

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,440
sharing and everything else like that

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,640
then 10 minutes uh before your talk

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,160
you're gonna join where the prior

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,680
speaker is finishing again you enter

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,840
into a queue so that's not a big deal

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
so make sure this is all working

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,439
and you should have verified your

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,000
settings uh using the green room so now

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
i joined the link for the actual

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
live stream and i'm going to say enter

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
studio

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
now that i've entered studio it tells me

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,640
that i'm backstage

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,840
so the prior speaker just finished

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
and they are going to

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
go away because they don't have q and

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,880
a's

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,119
they've got the advertisements up there

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,119
those would be for all of the sponsors

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
at this point i need to get ready so i'm

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
going to share

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,560
i can do it two ways i can share my

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
slides

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,040
or

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,320
i can share my screen

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
in either case

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,560
i recommend making sure that you can see

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,119
the private chat

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
and this is so that you can comments are

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,920
public so you don't want to comment in

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
comments that goes out to the youtube

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
channel you want to comment in private

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,640
chat to say that you're ready

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
to

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
start your talk whenever they are you

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,200
can see i've got my speaker notes up

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,319
here so i'm ready to go

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,239
it's important to if you can have two

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,920
screens so that you're able to see your

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
speaker notes your private chat

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
everything because i'm down here this is

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,959
the cue

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,800
so when i'm in the queue

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
no one can see or hear me even though

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
i'm talking and my mic is working so

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,519
don't worry about muting your mic or

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,879
your video because i'm in the queue i'm

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,160
not live yet

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
so i've got everything ready so i'm just

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
going to say i am ready

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
and the mc should come on to introduce

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
me

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,799
thanks

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
there we go i've got my slides so this

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,159
one is the shared slide deck

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
which means that here at the bottom i

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
can progress the slides

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,599
by clicking these

83
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,799
um

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
and so that makes it pretty easy but

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
again can't see the speaker notes in

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
here so i've got my speaker and it's off

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
here on the other half of my screen i

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,200
happen to have

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
a big screen

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
so i could go through give my

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
presentation i might see

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
questions come through in private chat

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,319
or i might see my speaker wrangler

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
saying hey you've only got five minutes

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,879
left

96
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,680
um you know that kind of communication

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
so try and keep an eye on it

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
and then when i'm done oh no 10 minutes

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
left quick go faster so go faster

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,239
uh

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,040
now

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
jamie can you switch me to the screen

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
share

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
out of the other one so i can show how

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,840
that

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
progresses there we go so with this one

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
it's sharing my entire screen which is

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
what i told it to do so i go make sure

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,639
this is full screen mode

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
and it appears here on my screen so your

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
keynote or whatever you can just get it

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
to progress

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
and again you can see that i've got my

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,479
speaker slides going over here

115
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
so this one may be easier for you

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
if you're not having two presenters

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
share one slide deck

118
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,240
um just because these things will keep

119
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,479
in sync and progress

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
together

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,160
uh so okay i got 10 minutes left i got

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
to the end i've worked out ahead of time

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
with my speaker wrangler that they're

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
going to pass me on any questions so at

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
this point i'll say

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,560
hey

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,720
do i have any questions from the

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
audience and the speaker wrangler should

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,680
catch any of those questions i have a

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,880
lot of slides sorry

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,120
we'll get to the end uh so i get my

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,479
first question

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,560
and i'm like okay

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
the question is we recommend you repeat

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
the question out loud for the sake of

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
the recording

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
as well as for anyone who maybe is not

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,080
in the discord who might just be

139
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
watching the live stream so the question

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
is you know what is sas well sas stands

141
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,240
for static application security testing

142
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,800
and you use it for x blah blah blah you

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,320
know whatever whatever it is you need to

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,440
say

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,039
uh and then

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
you may stop getting questions there may

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
be more questions for you but you may

148
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
stop getting them because your time is

149
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
up so when your time is up

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
um your you can either just close this

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
tab in stream yards all you need to do

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
you don't need to like exit log out

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
anything you just close the tab boom

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
you're gone no problem

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
uh or

156
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,120
you

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
can get removed from stream if you're

158
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
going over

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
you might just get taken away

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
so

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
hopefully this is helpful please let us

162
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
know if you have any questions and see

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
