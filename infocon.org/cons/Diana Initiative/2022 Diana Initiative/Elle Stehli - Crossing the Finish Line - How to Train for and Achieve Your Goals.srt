1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,200
hello i'm elle welcome to my talk

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,599
crossing the finish line how to train

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,679
for and achieve your goals in security

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
who am i

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,240
again i'm elle i'm an application

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
security analyst

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
formerly i was a developer um i'm a

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920
marathoner

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,079
i wanted to give this talk because it's

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,440
a topic that i feel strongly about

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
i remember my first security conference

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
i was so excited

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
and enthusiastic but i was also

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
completely overwhelmed

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,039
even the beginner talks i felt that i

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,239
understood

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
maybe a quarter of what they were saying

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,239
and

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
i had a background in i.t for years so i

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
i can't even imagine how difficult it

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
would be for someone coming from a

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,399
different area

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,199
um

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,159
so i am giving the talk that

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
i would have wanted to hear when i first

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,479
got started

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,439
where we are now

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,240
is you are interested in security and

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,799
you want to begin or to continue

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,320
learning

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,320
but there is no one correct path or

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
clear progression in security

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
imposter syndrome conflicting advice

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
gatekeeping

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
fear uncertainty and doubt can make it

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
feel overwhelming especially in the

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
beginning

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,079
you may be wondering what what you do

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,640
first where do you begin how do you

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,240
how do you get started

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,880
and that is what we're going to discuss

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,360
in this talk

43
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
to reach a goal you train for it

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,320
first choose your goal

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
and create your training plan

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,880
then do the work

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,919
day by day step by step

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,200
it doesn't matter if it's fast or slow

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
progress

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
you just need to make continual steady

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
progress forward

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
and just keep going until you reach your

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,879
goal

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,760
or since i'm using running analogies

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
until you cross the finish line

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
why running

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
analogies well it's because running is

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,599
what i know

59
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,560
but

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
it could be anything it could be

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
learning to speak another language it

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
could be learning to play musical

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
instrument

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,879
it is choose your own adventure

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
whatever helps you understand the

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,518
concepts

67
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,360
when i

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
when i talk about myself running

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,959
i also want to explain that you may be

70
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,959
imagining me

71
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
leaping gracefully like a gazelle

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and i also like to imagine me running

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
like that but

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
the actuality i think is probably closer

75
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,920
to

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
if you imagine

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
a horde of zombies

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,879
and

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,440
a woman staggering just ahead of them

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
that's probably more

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,440
what i look like when i'm running

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
however

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
i've learned in distance running it does

84
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
not matter

85
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
how slow you run as long as you just

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
keep going

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
and when you reach your goal they give

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,159
you a medal just for finishing

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
so

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
i believe that it's appropriate for

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,400
for getting into security and studying

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
as well because again it doesn't matter

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
how quickly or how slowly

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,640
you may reach your goals as long as you

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
just

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
keep going

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
running is familiar to most people the

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,599
concepts are easy to understand there's

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
nothing particularly complicated about

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
it

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
um

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
and again as i said above

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
it's relevant because you just

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
keep going that's that's the key you

105
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
just keep doing it until you reach your

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,120
goal

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
let's get going

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,560
first thing to do

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
remember you can do this take a deep

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
breath you've got this

111
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
second remember that you're a beginner

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
don't compare yourself to somebody who's

113
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
giving a talk on the main stage at

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
defcon because that would be like a

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
beginning runner comparing yourself to

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,759
an olympic

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,520
medalist in the marathon

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
you may be there someday but

119
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,199
not

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
not yet at the beginning

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,960
secondly

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
don't compare yourself you may have

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
heard four or five talks already today

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
by four or five different people there's

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
a reason that you didn't hear

126
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,240
one person giving four or five talks

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
sprinters and marathoners are almost

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
never the same people don't expect

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
yourself to know

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
all things

131
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
and the third thing is google is your

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,159
friend

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
almost anything that you need to know is

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
available online

135
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
they can point you to all the resources

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
that you need so just break the

137
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
questions down into

138
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
as specific of a question as you can

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,039
think of

140
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,280
to try to narrow it down and weed out

141
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
the garbage

142
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
so first thing you do is create your

143
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,840
plan

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
which begins with assessing where you

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
are currently

146
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,600
do you have any i.t experience do you

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
have any i.t adjacent experience

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
there are many backgrounds that are

149
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
suited nicely for particular areas of

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,560
security such as if you're currently in

151
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
technical writing electronics marketing

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
project management

153
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
law

154
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
it can be easier to transition to

155
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
particular areas however if you have no

156
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
technical background at all the world is

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,240
your oyster you can go into any area

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,479
that seems interesting to you and of

159
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,960
course regardless of your background

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,800
you can you can do

161
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,720
the same and go into any area of

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,240
security that appeals to you

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,440
what areas are you currently interested

164
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,639
in there are many many different areas

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
in security that you might consider

166
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
learning more about

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,620
um

168
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,880
[Music]

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
red team is

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
offensive security

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
professionals who

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
focus on attacking systems and breaking

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
into the defenses

174
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,800
while the blue team

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
are those who maintain the defenses

176
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,319
and the purple team encourages the red

177
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,120
and blue teams to work together to share

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
insights and feedback

179
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
to enhance the security posture

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
application security focuses on on

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
software on the applications

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,000
where network security

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
is concerned with maintaining the

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,800
integrity of the network

185
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,199
cloud security is

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
focusing on the security of cloud

187
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
computing um

188
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,400
digital forensics would include

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
recovery

190
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,880
investigation and

191
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,599
analysis of material that is found in

192
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
digital devices

193
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
or

194
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
internet of things security or iot

195
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
security

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
is

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
would be security cameras appliances

198
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
if you want to get into car hacking this

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
would be for you

200
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
uh critical infrastructure security

201
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,840
is

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
the security of

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
the electricity grid the traffic signals

204
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
hospitals

205
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
things like that

206
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
next thing is to

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,639
consider any constraints that you may

208
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
have

209
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
any factors that need to be taken into

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,240
account

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
when you're creating your plan

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
how many hours per week can you devote

213
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
on a longer term basis

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
to reaching your goal

215
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
do you have any any dates in mind

216
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,600
perhaps you're a student and you want to

217
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
achieve a goal by the end of summer or

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
by the end of the school year

219
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
are you currently in it or an i.t

220
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
adjacent field

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
if you're not that certainly certainly

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
will not stop you from reaching your

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
goal but it might

224
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,440
mean that you

225
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
might need a little bit more time in the

226
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
beginning

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
finances

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
there are a ton of

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
free or minimal cost resources

230
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
there are also

231
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
some some things that you might want to

232
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
accomplish for your goal that are

233
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
are more expensive

234
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
can you get your work to pay for them as

235
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
training do you have any other financial

236
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,279
resources that you can tap into

237
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,120
and finally

238
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
and i want to stress this

239
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
apply for scholarships

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
scholarships to cons scholarships to

241
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
training

242
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,839
do not

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
remove yourself from consideration

244
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
do not assume that you don't know enough

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,120
do not assume that

246
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
you're not the kind of person that

247
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,399
they're looking for or that someone else

248
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,480
needs it more

249
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
you apply for them if you meet the

250
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
criteria

251
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
you let them

252
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,399
be the ones to decide

253
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
now you have taken the time to

254
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
assess

255
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
where you currently are

256
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
and what

257
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
areas of interest you may have and what

258
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
limitations

259
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,720
you may have and as you

260
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
consider these things this is when the

261
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,079
search engine

262
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,399
use will come in handy because you this

263
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
will help you to really narrow down some

264
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
possible goals

265
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
for example

266
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
looking for free cloud security

267
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
information

268
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,519
so

269
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
you should be getting ready to

270
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
choose your race

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
so this is certainly not an inclusive

272
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,920
list of potential goals but just for

273
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
some examples

274
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
um you might decide to

275
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,440
get a certification um a always an

276
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
always popular beginner level

277
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
certification is the comptia security

278
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
plus because

279
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
it's required for a fair number of

280
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
entry-level security positions

281
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,880
you might

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,640
set a goal to do a number of online labs

283
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,399
such as to

284
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
maybe complete a try hackme learning

285
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
path

286
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,040
your goal might be to

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,800
get a job or an internship

288
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
an iit support tech

289
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
or help desk position is always a good

290
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
foundation

291
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
to

292
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,600
transition into security or you might

293
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
want to get a security internship

294
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
if

295
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
this is your goal you would probably

296
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
want to

297
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,639
set benchmarks such as sending out x

298
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,160
number of

299
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
applications per week and networking

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
with y number

301
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
of people in the industry

302
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,040
you might decide to take

303
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
an online course

304
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,839
or an in-person course

305
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,040
um such as sans cyberaces

306
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
is an entry level

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,399
course um

308
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,040
you might you might want to learn a new

309
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
programming language

310
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,760
any language would be useful bash python

311
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
or powershell

312
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,800
would all be ones that would be

313
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
particularly helpful

314
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
in security

315
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
i do not recommend this is my personal

316
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
opinion but i do not recommend

317
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,720
a cyber security boot camp unless

318
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,160
it's free

319
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
because

320
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,800
and again this is just my opinion

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
some of the ones that i've seen

322
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
are very expensive and there's so many

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
free or

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,920
very low cost resources that are

325
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,040
available

326
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,000
that

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
again in my opinion

328
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
if you devote the same amount of time

329
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
to lower cost resources you would be you

330
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
would be better off in the long run

331
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
and when you're setting your goals

332
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
remember to

333
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
set smart goals

334
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,279
specific measurable achievable relevant

335
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,720
and time-bound and if you're not

336
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
familiar with them

337
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
again you can google them

338
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,880
but i won't spend time on them

339
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,600
during this talk

340
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
now it's time to just do it

341
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
do not wait for the perfect time there

342
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,519
will never be a perfect time

343
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,440
just do it

344
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,839
remember there is no right or wrong goal

345
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
there is no one path into security

346
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,399
everyone's path will be different

347
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
the most important thing is to just

348
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
choose a goal and get started on it

349
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
you're not making a lifetime commitment

350
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,519
you can change for the next goal if you

351
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
decide once you reach this goal if you

352
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
feel that another area might interest

353
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
you more

354
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,639
people in security

355
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,720
change their areas of focus all of the

356
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,760
time

357
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,000
the time that you spend on achieving

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
this goal will not be wasted

359
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,920
think of a couch potato who

360
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,120
begins

361
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
running to become a sprinter and then

362
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
they decide to change into a distance

363
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
runner that training all all of the

364
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,440
training that they did

365
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
is still going to be a huge help and

366
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
they will be so much further ahead than

367
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
the person who was a couch potato for

368
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,920
another six months

369
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,839
i realized that a lot of people

370
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
currently are in positions where

371
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
it may be really difficult to to get

372
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
started you may not have much access at

373
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
all to resources so

374
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
some of the options some things i wanted

375
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,959
to point out if you're near a public

376
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,440
library um

377
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,720
many libraries have internet access

378
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
including computer access

379
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,639
you can you can access training courses

380
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,600
you can

381
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
check out books if you have internet

382
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,360
access

383
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,839
at all there are many many youtube

384
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
videos that you can watch on cyber

385
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
security issues

386
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
if you do not have

387
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
a computer that you can or will use

388
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
for

389
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,759
trying to learn to attack

390
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
like for example hack the box now has

391
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,279
the virtual

392
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
attack box phone box

393
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,519
which

394
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
can be used if you're concerned about

395
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
you for example if you're if your family

396
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
shares one computer and you're

397
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
concerned about installing different

398
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
tools on it

399
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
sometimes you can

400
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
be gifted a hand-me-down computer from

401
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
someone or a company for example if it's

402
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
a bit older and they're upgrading

403
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
especially if it may be a windows

404
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,279
computer

405
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
and it cannot support the next version

406
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
of windows

407
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
this could be a great time to install

408
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,440
linux on it

409
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
if you don't know anything about linux

410
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
this is an even better time to learn

411
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,519
about it because that is something that

412
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,600
you will find very very useful in

413
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
security

414
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,759
the cyber security and infrastructure

415
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,680
security agency

416
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,079
has some

417
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
different things to help people

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
including

419
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
three mobile games

420
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,440
available on android and ios

421
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
um defend the crown network collapse and

422
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,079
hotel hijinks so if all you have is your

423
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,199
phone

424
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,560
your smartphone

425
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,680
you could get started that way um

426
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,439
the federal training virtual environment

427
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
is geared towards

428
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
federal employees

429
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
but some of their some of the courses

430
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
are available to the public and some of

431
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,280
the ones that i saw

432
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
included coding reverse engineering

433
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
cyber essentials cloud security

434
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,839
and there are so many other options

435
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,480
so again

436
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
don't let where you are now

437
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,520
stop you from getting started

438
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,720
and

439
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,840
the as you as you move along you'll

440
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,360
start to find

441
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
more and more resources and it will

442
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
actually become easier

443
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,760
and easier to find

444
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
other things that will work with

445
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,559
whatever your situation is

446
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
next what happens on the long run stays

447
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
on the long run so you need to find your

448
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,000
support team others working towards

449
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
security goals

450
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
they don't have to be the same goals

451
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
that yours are

452
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,799
they can be different ones as long as

453
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,120
you all can help each other encourage

454
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,639
each other support each other

455
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,640
um

456
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,360
many people in security on twitter

457
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
you can also follow someone linkedin and

458
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,480
there's

459
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,679
many many

460
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
slack and discord servers that are

461
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,039
dedicated to security issues

462
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,080
so

463
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
how to find them

464
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
i recommend

465
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
following the speakers

466
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,799
and any others that you may meet or talk

467
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,520
to and as you start to follow people

468
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,000
you'll start to get more suggestions for

469
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
other people to follow

470
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
um if somebody says something that you

471
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
find concerning or just not interesting

472
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
just unfollow them

473
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,440
um but it's it's a starting point

474
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,559
you can

475
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,360
attend your local b-sides

476
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
if you have missed it or you are not in

477
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,280
an area that you could easily get to it

478
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
usually they'll have a website with some

479
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
kind of contact information

480
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,640
ask them i mean most people

481
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
are eager to help

482
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,799
and they may have

483
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,360
a slack or discord themselves or an

484
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,799
email list

485
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
and then you could meet some local

486
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
people

487
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
another thing that you would want to

488
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,440
consider is

489
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
joining an organization that

490
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,360
has

491
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
where you might be able to find people

492
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
more similar to you

493
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
um some of the options with that are

494
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,919
wesis women in cyber security or wisp

495
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,000
women in security and privacy

496
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,480
um international consortium of minority

497
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
cyber security professionals

498
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,720
international order of black security

499
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,400
executives

500
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,200
um

501
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
neuro cyber is for more diverse

502
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,400
individuals queer con has local meetups

503
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,320
there are some companies that have slack

504
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
and discord

505
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
servers

506
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
uh trusted sec has

507
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,400
um discord in slack for example and

508
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
they can also tend to be to be more

509
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,000
uh less less wild west than some of the

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,280
other ones

511
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
as well so

512
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
that's also something to consider

513
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,159
now you've set your goal now you have

514
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,000
your plan ready and you are off

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
so putting on your shoes is the hardest

516
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
part

517
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
if you're having an off day you just

518
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,520
don't

519
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
feel like it

520
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
try to commit to making at least some

521
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
progress if you had planned to work

522
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
on that day

523
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,400
try try to try to do at least something

524
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,159
for example if

525
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,240
you were planning on reading

526
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
a chapter of

527
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
a textbook

528
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
try to commit to reading

529
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
half of the chapter or if you were going

530
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
to do labs for two hours

531
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,679
tell yourself that you're going to do it

532
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,159
for half an hour because a lot of times

533
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
once you get going once

534
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,960
once you start you'll find that you

535
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
want to keep going

536
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
however

537
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,000
make sure that you schedule in rest days

538
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
so that you don't get burned out

539
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,280
it's it's difficult to

540
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
work non-stop seven days a week for an

541
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
extended time period

542
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,720
without it catching up with you so try

543
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,559
to be sure that you honor your rest days

544
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,080
and actually

545
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
rest

546
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
at least rest from security and also

547
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
having other interests is helps you to

548
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,679
be more well-rounded

549
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,760
and trust your training

550
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,520
which means there there will be other

551
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
people who are trying to achieve the

552
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,799
same thing that you are

553
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,480
but they're going about it a different

554
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
way and that's fine for example if

555
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
you're studying for the security plus

556
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
certification

557
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
there are multiple

558
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,840
videos tutorials books

559
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,080
that can be used for it

560
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
there's no there's no one right or wrong

561
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,000
one so if you as long as you feel that

562
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
you are making progress with whatever

563
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
you're using

564
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,320
don't change just continue ahead if you

565
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
run into someone else that just got

566
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,200
theirs and said oh i used

567
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
whatever it was

568
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
don't it's not going to be helpful for

569
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
you to repeatedly keep switching

570
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,120
from one to the next just try as long as

571
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
you feel that you're making progress now

572
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
of course if you are really struggling

573
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
with something then that's different and

574
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,400
you might want to consider

575
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
reassessing the situation

576
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
but typically

577
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
as long as you're making progress you'll

578
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,039
just continue forward

579
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,480
running will destroy your knees you know

580
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
next

581
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,120
gatekeepers and other people who will

582
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,080
try to block or undermine your progress

583
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
they are not always

584
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
who you think they might be so

585
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,320
be prepared for that

586
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,640
unfortunately sometimes they

587
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,480
they can be people

588
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,520
who

589
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
are friends or family and mean well but

590
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,199
for whatever reason

591
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,159
are blocking your progress or slowing it

592
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
um so there's a few a few ways to

593
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
identify them as

594
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,120
opposed to someone who really is trying

595
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,080
to give constructive helpful criticism

596
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,480
um the first one is

597
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
do they have any experience at all in

598
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
the area that they're talking about

599
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
if not

600
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,559
as as the saying goes

601
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,400
don't listen to criticism from somebody

602
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,760
that you would not go to for advice

603
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,919
if they do have experience is it

604
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,640
relevant experience is it recent

605
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,080
experience

606
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,799
is it in the area that

607
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,679
you're

608
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
interested in getting into

609
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
um

610
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,520
with the running analogy you would not

611
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,919
go to a marathoner

612
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,679
to ask

613
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,279
advice about sprinting it's generally

614
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,279
not going to be the most

615
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,799
helpful

616
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,559
advice

617
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
um

618
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,600
does this person offer

619
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
useful suggestions for alternative

620
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440
methods or do they just tell you

621
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,039
that what you're currently doing is

622
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,600
wrong

623
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
and this is this is important because

624
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
you you may actually be doing something

625
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
that you know that could be improved i

626
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,000
mean we can all improve

627
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,880
but if you just are being told no no

628
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,039
that's not no

629
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,640
without some alternative option for

630
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
like that's that's a great try that's a

631
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
great start but have you considered

632
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
this other method

633
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,640
and the most important thing

634
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,159
is

635
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
after you talk to that person

636
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
do you feel better about yourself or do

637
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
you feel worse about yourself

638
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
because the bottom line is regardless of

639
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,640
how helpful their advice is or how

640
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
relevant it might be

641
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,279
or how well-meaning it they may be

642
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,440
if you feel worse about yourself

643
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840
consistently worse about yourself in

644
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,039
your situation after you talk to them

645
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,640
this might be somebody that you don't

646
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,039
want to

647
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,919
talk with about your plans because it's

648
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,159
your it's going to be very difficult for

649
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,679
you

650
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,320
to keep going if you feel continuously

651
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
discouraged over and over

652
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,360
there are enough

653
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,720
enough people out there who will be

654
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
supportive and encouraging

655
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,120
and the time you spend with people who

656
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,279
are not encouraging is time that could

657
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
be spent

658
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,799
with others who will be supportive of

659
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
you

660
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
you are doing great keep going

661
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,360
so

662
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,240
it's also really super helpful to have

663
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,400
what i like to refer to as the

664
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
spectators

665
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,799
these are not people who are

666
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,640
in your support group because they are

667
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,480
people who are not in security they

668
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,559
don't want to be in security

669
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,279
but they do support you

670
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:57,720
and

671
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,720
[Music]

672
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
it can be anyone from spouses friends

673
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,559
family to the old man at the coffee shop

674
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,080
that

675
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
just every day

676
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,679
you know gives you the thumbs up and

677
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,000
asks how it's going

678
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
it really is helpful

679
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,520
um

680
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,159
get back up when you fall down

681
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,799
you you will have you will miss days

682
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,000
there will be days that you were

683
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
planning on working

684
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,679
and learning things and you will miss

685
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
them there will be concepts that you

686
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
struggle with that

687
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,240
seem impossible to understand there are

688
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,159
things that will take much longer than

689
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,440
you thought

690
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,760
and that's okay that's fine it happens

691
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,000
to everybody just

692
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
shake it off just keep going keep trying

693
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,799
to progress forward it's

694
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,640
again that's fine don't don't let it

695
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
throw you off of your plans

696
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
however

697
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,000
is that don't don't run if you're

698
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,240
injured if you have a if you're having a

699
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,600
major serious issue

700
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,799
um if there's a serious illness if

701
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,559
there's job loss if there's

702
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,760
you know

703
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,399
some other major serious thing comes up

704
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,880
financial problems divorce

705
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
um

706
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
take a break or even consider

707
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
pausing

708
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
because it's not it's not going to help

709
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,840
you to push through unless you're

710
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,279
literally within a week or so of

711
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,440
accomplishing your goal that's it's not

712
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,640
going to be helpful to push through

713
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,760
something like that it's better off

714
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
you're better off at that time

715
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,480
just taking the time off focusing on

716
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,360
getting done what needs to get done or

717
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,520
getting through

718
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,440
what needs to be gotten through

719
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,240
and returning when things are

720
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,559
more settled and i i think the way that

721
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,919
you can

722
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
tell if it's

723
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,320
the difference between something

724
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,360
where it's a short-term issue or not

725
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
the way i always try to judge it is you

726
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
don't

727
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,760
you don't make the decision rashly you

728
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,480
don't really decide on a day that for

729
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,799
example like you don't feel like i i

730
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,679
don't feel like working on this today

731
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,600
you kind of take a step back make that

732
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,440
decision on a day that you had already

733
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,320
planned to not work and

734
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
and reassess at that point and see you

735
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,399
know ask if it's something that you

736
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,399
really can do or not

737
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,520
or if you need to take a break

738
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,039
it's only mild what

739
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,039
so

740
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,399
never look at the top of the hill

741
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,159
which means

742
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,720
never think about how far away from your

743
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
goal you are never think about how far

744
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,840
you are from

745
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,240
becoming cso or a keynote speaker

746
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,960
instead think about how far you've

747
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,559
already come from where you were when

748
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,200
you started

749
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,039
stay hydrated

750
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,799
it make sure that you're taking care of

751
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
your physical health and your mental

752
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,919
health

753
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,120
um proper nutrition hydration

754
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,039
exercise i know

755
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,080
a sleep are necessary for long-term

756
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,080
success

757
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,399
i can't i've got a long run in the

758
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,919
morning

759
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,200
so that's when you're feeling you're

760
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,440
feeling discouraged everybody else seems

761
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,679
to be going out

762
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,480
you're at home by yourself studying

763
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,159
working on things

764
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,159
so when you feel discouraged

765
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,720
disappointed feel that you're missing

766
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,159
out while everyone else is not having

767
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,679
fun

768
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,159
reach out to your support group or your

769
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,880
cheerleaders the nice thing about

770
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,679
the internet is

771
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,440
no matter what time of day or night it

772
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,480
is

773
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,519
there are people online

774
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,799
and also

775
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,000
focus on

776
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,679
on how you'll feel

777
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,799
when you reach your goal

778
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,679
run the mile you're in means try to do

779
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,559
the best you can on where you are

780
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,440
right now on what you're working on

781
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,360
right now this week

782
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,399
if you

783
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,080
struggled in the past couple of weeks

784
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,000
with a concept and it took you three

785
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
weeks to get something that you thought

786
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
was gonna take three days

787
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,960
it's over

788
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
don't dwell on it

789
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
it doesn't matter at this point if

790
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,440
you're concerned about two weeks from

791
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
now when you have to study cryptography

792
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,600
um

793
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,360
don't worry about that

794
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,399
just try to focus on

795
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,518
what you're working on right now

796
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,799
run

797
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,799
i thought they said rum

798
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,519
this is one of my favorite slides

799
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,799
so

800
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,000
be sure to schedule time for

801
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,640
fun security activities

802
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,880
and not just slogging along towards your

803
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,919
goal

804
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,519
and this is especially important i think

805
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,799
in the beginning

806
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,200
because honestly i i believe in the

807
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
beginning it's it's tougher right i mean

808
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
it's

809
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,840
it's it's a lot tougher to run

810
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,720
your first mile going from zero to one

811
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,120
mile i assure you it is much much more

812
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,679
difficult than it is to go from mile 19

813
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
to mile 20.

814
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
and

815
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
so

816
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,720
you want you want to have some fun

817
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,240
activities in there to remind you of why

818
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
you enjoy this

819
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,640
so some of my suggestions are

820
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
if you have a local b-sides or a local

821
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,519
conference and can make it i think

822
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,039
that's a great thing especially the

823
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,440
b-sides because they tend to be minimal

824
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,050
cost maybe 10 15

825
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,320
[Music]

826
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,279
um

827
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,760
you'll meet other people you'll attend

828
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
some different talks

829
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,519
i think

830
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,440
with the talks it's excellent if you're

831
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,840
not already doing

832
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,080
so i think it's a great idea to sit in

833
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,720
talks about which you know a topic that

834
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,600
you know nothing about and honestly even

835
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
if you understand 10 of what they're

836
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,240
talking about

837
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
it can really start to give you some

838
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,640
different ways of looking at things

839
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,320
and some different things different lots

840
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,679
of things to try

841
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,640
um

842
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
capture the flags are always fun

843
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,600
there are all sorts of different places

844
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,240
to have them companies have them

845
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,559
they're available online at the end of

846
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,519
the year

847
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,080
there will be the sans holiday hack the

848
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,720
try hack me advent of cyber will come

849
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,519
out

850
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,279
um

851
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,919
don't feel that you don't know enough to

852
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
get started on those

853
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
i mean again this falls into

854
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,159
the category of just do it a lot of the

855
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,919
ctfs i've seen

856
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,880
especially ones geared towards

857
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
for beginners

858
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
if you know how to google you can

859
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
usually get

860
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,320
a couple of flags

861
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
and that's how you learn

862
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,639
people love to help

863
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
you know with capture the flags

864
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,719
and you can meet

865
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,199
like-minded people

866
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,239
i personally like lock picking

867
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,800
and lockpick bypass although i'm not

868
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,480
very good at it

869
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,359
i find it very relaxing um probably

870
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,359
because

871
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,280
it's just a totally different thing

872
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,599
there are

873
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,719
videos about the lock pick bypass

874
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,239
um and

875
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,560
lock picking also of course

876
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
and you never know when you might need

877
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,119
to shim open a pair of handcuffs

878
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,440
right

879
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,599
soldering and badges

880
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,240
and again something i'm not all that

881
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,880
good at but i really enjoy doing i like

882
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
trying to solder and the badges are

883
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,040
awesome because they're pretty

884
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,119
blinking badges

885
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,440
and the entire reason that i started

886
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,400
running distances was i learned that you

887
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,200
get really cool badges

888
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,280
if you run far enough

889
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,839
so you can imagine how i feel about

890
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,400
pretty blinking badges

891
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
bling

892
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,359
um

893
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,960
you could

894
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,720
get a raspberry pi and do things with

895
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,640
that there are any number of side

896
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
projects

897
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,480
that you could work on but again just

898
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,160
make sure it's something something fun

899
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,839
whatever to you

900
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,359
is fun

901
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,920
may you may not

902
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,400
be at all in the area of security that

903
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,839
you're interested in

904
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,880
but just enjoy it

905
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,640
hitting the wall

906
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,240
so

907
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,839
everything is fine

908
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
you've been going along great for weeks

909
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
or even months and you're coming up on

910
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,280
being done and all of a sudden

911
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,800
blam

912
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,240
you have zero motivation zero enthusiasm

913
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,440
and you just

914
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,160
you just don't want to do it anymore

915
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,040
so remember if it were easy everyone

916
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
would do it

917
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,320
you have the strength to do this

918
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,359
dig deep

919
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,480
find it

920
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,760
you can do this

921
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,920
if you're close to the end

922
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,760
and you can

923
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
cut down or postpone other

924
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,910
responsibilities um

925
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,440
[Music]

926
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,760
for a few weeks if if it gives you if it

927
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,079
gives you that extra

928
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,320
enthusiasm to move forward does it

929
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,040
matter if you don't do the dusting for a

930
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,400
few weeks um

931
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,839
visualize your self-finishing

932
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,400
picture the certification with your name

933
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,760
on it

934
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,640
or

935
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,880
imagine demonstrating the application

936
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,119
that you wrote in the new language that

937
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,839
you learned

938
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,280
start counting down like instead of

939
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,400
saying

940
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,000
i've done 36 labs so far

941
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,160
say to yourself i only have five more

942
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,480
labs to do i only have four more labs to

943
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,280
do

944
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
or i only have three chapters left

945
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,599
and most important just remember

946
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,800
dig deep

947
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,839
you can do this and just keep moving

948
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,680
forward because you're almost there

949
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,320
what did they call the last person to

950
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,720
finish a marathon

951
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,040
so

952
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,240
your support group you may have

953
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,920
other people who are working towards the

954
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,320
same goals as you

955
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
and they may be finishing

956
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,839
and you're not

957
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,960
don't compare yourself to others who may

958
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
have reached their goals faster than you

959
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,800
or who

960
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
make it

961
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,400
who you feel

962
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,119
make it seem like it's easy

963
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,119
because remember

964
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,000
the race is long in the end it's only

965
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
with yourself

966
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,119
just

967
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,960
keep going

968
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
you've got this

969
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,119
you can do this

970
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,839
and the answer to the question of what

971
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,520
do they call the last person to finish a

972
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
marathon is

973
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,520
a marathoner

974
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,119
congratulations

975
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,800
you have reached your goal

976
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,839
so the first thing to do of course is to

977
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,680
celebrate

978
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,000
you've earned it and you deserve it

979
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,560
reward yourself

980
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,160
and rest take some time to get caught up

981
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,520
on

982
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
things that may have gotten put to the

983
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,040
side

984
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,000
other activities or hobbies

985
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,200
and and just take a bit of a break

986
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,119
when you feel ready reflect on the

987
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,440
lessons learned

988
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,720
what worked with your plan and

989
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
what didn't

990
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,839
did you for example find that

991
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,480
doing labs in the evening after the kids

992
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
went to bed

993
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,960
didn't really work as well as you'd

994
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,800
hoped because too often you found

995
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,079
yourself watching tv instead and next

996
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,640
time you might want to try

997
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
doing it in the morning

998
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:50,850
um

999
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,400
[Music]

1000
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,000
or what things did work well

1001
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,200
what did you enjoy and what didn't you

1002
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,400
enjoy

1003
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,280
if you were

1004
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,119
studying for

1005
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,240
a certification that was a very broad

1006
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,480
based one did you find

1007
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,359
for example maybe you found

1008
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,079
application security fascinating

1009
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,440
but

1010
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,119
maybe

1011
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,240
networking was not your thing at all

1012
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,960
and after you consider these things and

1013
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
when you feel ready

1014
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,800
set your next goal

1015
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,520
and repeat the process

1016
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,200
when does someone become a runner

1017
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,960
every few months in runner forums

1018
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,359
someone who is working their way through

1019
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,040
a couch potato to 5k training plan

1020
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,800
will ask

1021
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,520
when they will become a runner

1022
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
what conditions

1023
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,560
must be met

1024
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,359
for

1025
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,599
them to be a runner

1026
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,400
do they need to be able to run a 5k

1027
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,319
do they need to be able to run a 10

1028
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,800
minute mile

1029
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,000
and the answer is

1030
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
the same

1031
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,520
if you run

1032
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,680
you're a runner

1033
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
as the quote says it doesn't matter how

1034
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
fast or how far it doesn't matter if

1035
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,200
it's your first day or if you've been

1036
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,240
running for 20 years

1037
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,960
and this is important very important to

1038
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,640
remember because so many people

1039
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,480
say they want to

1040
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,359
get into security they're hoping to get

1041
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,440
into security

1042
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,079
but what does that mean

1043
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,640
into security there are people that

1044
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,319
you'll meet at cons that have jobs and

1045
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,319
security

1046
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,880
there are people that you will meet

1047
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
who do not

1048
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,359
and have a job in security and do not

1049
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,560
want one

1050
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,800
and to them it's a hobby and some of

1051
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
them are

1052
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,720
outstanding

1053
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,040
so

1054
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,119
the reason that i'm telling you this is

1055
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,800
because you're listening to this talk

1056
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,240
at this security conference

1057
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,440
which means

1058
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,400
you already are in security

1059
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,640
you've already begun

1060
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,880
you're on your way already and you have

1061
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,359
as much right to feel part of security

1062
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,480
as anyone else does

1063
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,000
so

1064
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,880
to sum up remember

1065
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,000
the steps of reaching your goals

1066
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,839
are to

1067
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,160
make a plan

1068
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,720
to stick with a plan

1069
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,839
focus on it make consistent progress

1070
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,359
forward

1071
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,920
it doesn't have to be fast but it does

1072
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,119
need to be fairly consistent and if you

1073
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,280
do that and stay focused

1074
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,000
you will succeed

1075
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,040
and i will see you at the finish line

1076
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,240

1077
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,280
