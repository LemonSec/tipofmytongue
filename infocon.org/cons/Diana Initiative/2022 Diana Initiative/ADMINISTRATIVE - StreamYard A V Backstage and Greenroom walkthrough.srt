1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,720
all right so if you signed up to do the

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,879
green room or the av

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,440
you're going to log into stream yard

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,599
uh it requires two-factor authentication

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,440
so we'll have to log in at the beginning

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,519
of your shift

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
you can put in your name you can put av

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,640
tech or

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,960
whatever you want

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
you can stop the camera and put in an

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,799
avatar of yourself if you want

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,679
but unless you pop onto screen which you

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,800
may need to

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,719
uh hopefully not

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,719
uh you should

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,000
you know just do whatever you're

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
comfortable with

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
there's other settings too

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
like virtual backgrounds

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,520
you need a green screen and stuff it's

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
camera intensive

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
so you can mess with these if you want

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
to

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
but in general you shouldn't have to do

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
any of that

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,600
so just click enter studio when you

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,120
enter you enter into the queue and

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,320
you're not part of the stream yet

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
you really don't want to be part of the

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
stream

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,479
at that point you can

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,840
provide

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
the

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
app if see if there's anybody in here

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,240
because you're an admin there's

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
currently nobody

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
in here yet

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,920
and you can provide messages to them if

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,680
they're in there and they're waiting for

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,640
you

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
if you're doing green room you probably

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
will need to pop on and just say hey yes

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,840
i can hear you yes i can see you yes i

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,920
can see your presentation you might need

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,439
to like walk them through finding the

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,159
share icon at the bottom of the screen

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
so they can share their slides

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,360
um or do a screen share if they don't

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
have speaker notes and it's in google

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
slides and they don't use animation or

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
videos they can do the direct sharing

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
from google slides

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
if they have animation or video or they

54
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
need to see their speaker notes we

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
recommend doing a screen share

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
so anyway

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
buttons across the bottom here are just

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,600
orientation of how you

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
arrange two

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,479
speakers

61
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,240
if there is two speakers or how you

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
arrange two speakers in a presentation

63
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,800
if there's a presentation

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,959
they're all pretty self-explanatory

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
icons don't hit leave studio obviously

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,239
now you can change your settings again

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,840
right there up the top there's this go

68
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,640
live uh

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
and so you'll obviously hit that at the

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
beginning of the day

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
so for branding we're going to have some

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
overlays loaded up like this

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
and then of course there's like our logo

74
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
and stuff so

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
and backgrounds will have a bunch of

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
different

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,319
uh choices uh for you to

78
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,680
leverage

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
and so what you're gonna do is

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,480
when

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
it is not the time for

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
the speaker to start yet

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,519
you

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
will put up

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
one of the overlays that has like a

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
thanks to our

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
sponsors so there'll be different

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,720
overlays you can pick

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,680
um

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,599
we'll probably just have one background

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,959
picked out and you can just leave it on

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
that

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
so you're going to want to hang out in

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
private chat

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,000
and say hey are you ready

96
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
and uh before they're

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,000
ready

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,599
or sorry

99
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
before the talk

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,159
this year it's going to be different

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,760
because we want to be broadcasting live

102
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,400
continuously so the beginning of the day

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,040
before the first talk of your shift

104
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
you're going to do

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
go live

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,400
and when i hit

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
go live the broadcast is going to be

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
there

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
so then once you hit the go live and it

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,439
says end broadcast you are live and so

111
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
you can bring the embassy up if the

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
emcee says that they're ready in private

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,560
chat the mc will say

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
thanks to all of our

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
lovely sponsors our next talk is going

116
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,319
to be

117
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
xyz

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
in some cases they may have a sponsor

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,680
deck or a slide that the

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
mc is trying to share so you could use

121
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,798
the dual mode to show the mc with the

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,639
presentation when they're done

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
introducing the speaker

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
you'll first bring up the speaker's

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
presentation

126
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
and then you will bring up the speaker

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,479
and then you will drop

128
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
your the embassy out of

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,280
the zone we have a cat cats are adorable

130
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,160
uh

131
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,639
when the speaker is done you'll want to

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,479
find out from the emcee in the private

133
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,919
chat if the emcee is reading the

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,080
question so if this is the end the mc

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
would come up and i would read the

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
question to

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,840
our speaker here and the speaker has

138
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,919
you know a feather and that is obviously

139
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,759
very important

140
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,520
and that gives them the opportunity to

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,479
answer

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,280
um or the emcee might just present the

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
questions to the speaker in private chat

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
the mc and the speaker is going to work

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
them out themselves

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,960
then when everybody is done there's the

147
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
remove button and you just click the

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
remove

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,960
and everybody is out

150
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
now last year we had you end broadcast

151
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
in between

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
this year we're not doing that this year

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
everybody's off screen they can't be

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
heard so you can just put up an overlay

155
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
again uh don't recommend the countdowns

156
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,479
because they make noise and you have to

157
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
listen to them

158
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,160
and that's pretty much it so you will

159
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
start the broadcast at the beginning of

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,160
your shift you'll get a couple of talks

161
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,600
then at the lunch break when we're

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
switching over avp

163
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,400
you'll hit end broadcast

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,320
and the button will

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
transition

166
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
and that's it
