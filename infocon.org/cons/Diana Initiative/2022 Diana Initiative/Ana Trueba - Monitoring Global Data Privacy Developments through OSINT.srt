00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,960
initiative for giving me this

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
opportunity

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,160
i'm a big big fan of this conference and

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
i'm just happy and honored to be here

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,239
and

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,960
this is my topic so let me get started

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
so first i'll introduce myself a bit i'm

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
a political scientist by training i

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,160
study political science at the

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
university of san diego

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
i'm a former public servant i'm based in

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
mexico city i was at the mexican foreign

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
ministry and at the mexican data

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,479
protection office for some years

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
and i decided to pivot into information

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,119
security and privacy a few years ago

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,520
but as part of that experience i learned

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
all about tracking monitoring and

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,640
keeping track of global developments

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
by using all kinds of tools and

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
techniques which i will talk to you

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
today specifically as a private privacy

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
currently i'm a compliance manager and a

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
data protection

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,520
officer yes i have both roles

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
at a software as a service company with

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
clients across latin america so my

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
challenge as the privacy officer is

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
keeping track of

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
any sort of privacy development where

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
it's a new court position regulatory

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
decision all kinds across this region um

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
as an information security person i'm

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520
currently

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
learning a lot about oscent and

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
preparing to

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
take my sisa certified information

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,360
security auditors exam

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
and just on a personal low note i'm a

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,399
big lover of sci-fi fantasy and horror i

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
especially like to write about these

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,758
stuff and um just a quick disclaimer of

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,200
course anything i say today is my own it

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
should not be

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
um

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,920
if any blames should not go into my

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
employer any organization i failed with

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
or my dog ollie who you can see right

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,400
there

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
so first

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
um understanding the problem and the

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,560
problem is privacy or data protection or

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
whatever you call it is a topic that is

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
changing very fast at a global scale and

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,239
it's a lot to keep track of you have new

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,720
regulations at a national level at a

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
sub-national level at a regional

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
out-of-state sector specific

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,640
you have traditional court decisions you

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
have changes in technology juices and

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
trends you have guidelines issued by

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
regulatory bodies you have all these

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
things to keep track of

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
as a privacy officer on top of

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
everything else you're already doing for

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
a company organization

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,040
so

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
i found that this is quite a problem and

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
often people end up just kind of

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
responding ad hoc like oh wait there's a

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
new issue theater there

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
and the reason why i kind of developed

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,280
the system and why i'm pursuing it today

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
is this is a way of making information

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,519
through barry bate very very basic oh

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,040
send come to you so this is very

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,239
accessible

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,319
almost all of the tools i talk about

95
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
today are free or have like a free tier

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,720
so let me begin

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
so first you need to you know define

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
ocean and i'm talking about a very

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,959
narrow area of ocean i know it's very

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,879
very broad there's all kinds of amazing

101
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,840
uses for it um thank you

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
michael and

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
what i'm talking right now is

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
specifically about tracking information

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
so here i really like the definition

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
from a fall place of the wikipedia entry

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
which is open source intelligence

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
it's like oh sorry thank you it's the

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
collection of analysis and of data

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
gathered from open sources to produce

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,799
actionable intelligence and the

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,640
wikipedia entry outlines a few

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
information streams which i will talk

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,760
throughout this presentation which are

115
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,879
mass media internet publications uh

116
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
government information and data and

117
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
commercial data and great literature

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
what i like about this definition is it

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,079
gets to the core of what is the

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
information that's going to be most

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,759
useful for a privacy professional

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
in terms of monitoring changes

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
and what i found in my personal

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
experience is that mass media is very

125
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
useful to keep track of the big picture

126
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
changes of like the

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,080
new regulations big picture things but

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
usually you know it's at the surface

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,720
it's gdpr this or

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,520
shrimp's to decision turns out um

131
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
validates um

132
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,520
privacy shield that sort of thing it's

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
very big picture so then you have

134
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
internet publications and citizen media

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
where you know social media fits into

136
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,080
this category or you can get a bit more

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
nuance

138
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,000
it depends but i'll talk about it in a

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
bit

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
then you have government and public

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
information it can help you detect new

142
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
regulatory guidance standards or

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
official documents

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
this can be very important if you're

145
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,639
like me working in an area where you do

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960
have regulators and who issue finding

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
stuff all the time

148
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,639
so you need to keep track of that in

149
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,720
order to ensure you're in compliance

150
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,639
then you have professional and academic

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
publications shout out to all my privacy

152
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,360
lawyer friends because this is where

153
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
lawyers really shine by going deep into

154
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,720
nuanced conversations about topics

155
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
sometimes these are useful sometimes

156
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,039
these are not it depends

157
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
then you have commercial

158
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
literature which is great for getting

159
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
industry trends and practices maybe how

160
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
competitors or others in your industry

161
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,199
are dealing with privacy problems

162
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,720
and then you have grey literature which

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
is everything and anything doesn't quite

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
fit it's um patents it's working papers

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
it's papers who haven't been published

166
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
and i find these are great for finding

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
super niche stuff that you might not

168
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
find anywhere else

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
so with that i'm going to start talking

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
about how you are going to use

171
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
ocean to make all of this information

172
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
come to you and make things easy and i

173
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,759
talk about doing this as a process from

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,360
diagnosis through planning through

175
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,639
evaluation

176
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
so as part of that i talk about the good

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
old deming cycle approach which is plant

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
do check act

179
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
i add a preliminary stage which is a

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
diagnosis stage

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
but i think that could also be a part of

182
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
your plan stage

183
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,160
i found this to be a very useful in

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
terms of framing

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,759
everything i do in terms of privacy

186
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
programs

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
so firstly of course you start with your

188
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
diagnosis and that is your w questions

189
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
your who what when where what

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
it's basically how you figure out what

191
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,120
you need to know and the best way to

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
doing this in my opinion is just to go

193
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
through all your company organizations

194
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
documentation on privacy or anything

195
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
related

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
and just kind of

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
go through it analyze it study it um go

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
through your privacy policy any cookie

199
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
policies probably see working group dire

200
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,840
documents

201
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
any regulatory

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,520
regulator recommendations that may have

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,440
been issued to you or your industry and

204
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
you just think that could be relevant go

205
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,080
through it

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
whatever we go through it um i'm going

207
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
to talk to you a bit about like how

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,919
you're going to break those topics down

209
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
so you can get the keywords that will

210
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
help you track um developments in the

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,319
space

212
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,160
so what i like to do is use guidance

213
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
questions these are a few that i've come

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
up with but you can come up with your

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
own questions you can look for questions

216
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,479
online

217
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
what you want to get out with this sort

218
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
of guidance question is break down all

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,440
those core strategic documents

220
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
into keywords into key topics that you

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
need to follow like what you absolutely

222
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,319
need to know from your privacy note as

223
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
in terms of monitoring keeping track of

224
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,440
changes

225
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
so

226
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
here are a few questions i'm not going

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
to go through them all but

228
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
my presentation will be up and you can

229
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,199
always dm me if you want to see any of

230
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
these but let me go through questions

231
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
one and three because i think these are

232
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,440
very useful to getting a bit of context

233
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,319
so here i have is the company or

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
organization subject to any data

235
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
protection privacy regulations at a

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,039
national state local or sector level

237
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
what are these just very briefly because

238
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,319
this is a public presentation i um

239
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
i gave a little brief answer for myself

240
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
for my company so it's a wide range of

241
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,720
data protection laws across latin

242
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
america including mexico colombia peru

243
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,679
argentina and brazil the laws that

244
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,599
currently apply are the following and

245
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000
that would be a very very long list

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,279
and what it

247
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,039
just didn't come out quite right because

248
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,159
it was supposed to highlight the

249
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
keywords but

250
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,120
here my keywords would be data

251
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,080
protection latin america the countries

252
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,959
and the insert list um i'm sorry that

253
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,600
highlight works worked weird but when i

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
get at is in like very few sentences or

255
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,720
maybe a paragraph or two kind of like an

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,959
abstract you want to get to the core

257
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,920
thing

258
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
um of what you're trying to find because

259
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
that's kind of you're starting to start

260
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
to know

261
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,440
go from this is my privacy program as to

262
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
these are the specific aspects of my

263
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
privacy program that i need to get track

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,519
of and that i need to monitor

265
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,680
and to give you a bit of context i the

266
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
second question right here what are

267
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
specific technologies data platforms and

268
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
other resources that are q2 business

269
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
and my answer would be as a payroll

270
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
software as a service provider pii

271
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
related to human resources employment

272
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
and other processes related to payroll

273
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
hr and related issues

274
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
i know this is very big but here like my

275
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,399
keywords would be payroll software as a

276
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,360
service human resources pii

277
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
these i would go through and like

278
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
actually circle these words and kind of

279
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,040
circle my answers and break them down

280
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
because as i go through that i'm gonna i

281
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,519
start seeing common terms i start seeing

282
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,800
obviously pii and privacy but also like

283
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,240
where i covered what areas are there um

284
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
well it's human resources and that has

285
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,680
implications in terms of what kind of

286
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
data does that mean well i know that

287
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,079
means

288
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,160
banking information and full names and

289
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,560
that sorts of things and that's where

290
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,399
you start getting an idea of what are

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,440
the key things you need to keep track of

292
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
and just a bit of advice when breaking

293
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
down documents again do whatever you

294
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,640
want um try to make them comprehensive

295
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
without being too heavy don't get too in

296
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,839
the weeds

297
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
the key goal is to get some keywords out

298
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,360
of these so um

299
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
with that in mind it doesn't have to be

300
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760
a big comprehensive overview just like a

301
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
few paragraphs

302
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
about your company's general goals or

303
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,480
whatever you think you need to know

304
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
whatever will guide your

305
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
privacy program will help a lot

306
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,600
so

307
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,320
in talking about keywords um it's very

308
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
important because like keywords will

309
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
become trackers so i like to think about

310
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,959
it as the keywords as the what and the

311
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,240
trackers of the how via the whom

312
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
what do i mean by these so a keyword is

313
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
something for me like privacy in latin

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
america and the tracker is me following

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
summarization who talks about privacy in

316
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
latin america and whatever that means it

317
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,680
might be twitter list it might be an rss

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,279
feed it might be

319
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
um yeah a google or some other aspect

320
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
but it's connecting your keyword

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
as with who is doing the work on that

322
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,200
and who is in the weeds

323
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,760
on that so that you can follow them

324
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
or track them in the way that you need

325
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,600
to and they will get the information to

326
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
you on the changes that you need

327
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
and a little bit about just how to

328
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,279
generally do this based on your

329
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,519
diagnosis you go through the keywords i

330
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,480
like to quite frankly use excel and word

331
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,160
clouds give me an idea what are the most

332
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,519
important things

333
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
you can use big data analytics tools you

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
can always all kinds of tools

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,880
you want to have at least 10 to 12 i

336
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,079
would say

337
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,160
keywords that you can play around with

338
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
as you start to figure it out what is

339
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,880
best that will guide who you follow

340
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
what you subscribe to and how you set up

341
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
your information stream so that

342
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,079
information comes to you

343
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
so now we get into the plan

344
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
planning stage which is

345
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,160
actually establishing the resources and

346
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
trackers

347
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
for that

348
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
you want to do two things think about

349
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,200
what is best for you and your

350
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,040
organization and where the information

351
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
is so it's a balance sometimes you'll

352
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
have to the best way to find information

353
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
is via social media quite frankly

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
twitter

355
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
extremely useful sometimes they'll be

356
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
subscription feeds or alerts sometimes

357
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
it might be another resource i tend to

358
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,399
focus on the first two

359
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,920
because those are the ones where i find

360
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
in the privacy space to be more useful

361
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,399
than perhaps some

362
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,920
big awesome tools which i'm still

363
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
learning about so i'm not sharing maybe

364
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
next year um

365
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,200
but like social media and subscriptions

366
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
and alerts rss feeds those two are where

367
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
i find a lot of the information that is

368
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,600
valid and actionable

369
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,720
and now you get to the meat of it which

370
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,120
is setting up the trackers um i like

371
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
three having two to three

372
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
places where you're gonna follow

373
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
information

374
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
do it you can do more i wouldn't do any

375
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
more than five um because it gets

376
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,720
chaotic it gets harder to keep track of

377
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,760
everything

378
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
i've lately come to use and find that

379
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
twitter lists um are super useful

380
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
i find social listening tools which i

381
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,440
will talk about in a minute also useful

382
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,040
especially if you're not sure who's

383
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
actually doing the talk the talking on

384
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
your keywords

385
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,639
my advice there is just you know plug in

386
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,800
your keywords as hashtags follow them

387
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,120
for a while and see who comes up what

388
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,880
are the anal basic analytics on that

389
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
and you have rss fades which i

390
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,519
personally love for this purpose um i'm

391
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
a little bit old school i find them

392
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
super super useful

393
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
i've but um again you can do whatever

394
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,839
you like

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
and then you have google alerts

396
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,240
newsletter subscriptions you have stuff

397
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,839
like medium

398
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,079
again the sky's the limit you want to

399
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,399
figure things out you want to organize

400
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
things in a way that's best for you my

401
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
recommendation is try to keep it minimal

402
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,920
because if it's always better to scale

403
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,800
up and have to scale down because

404
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,519
it's very hard to kind of

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
figure out what you can eliminate

406
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,079
so

407
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,639
so you get a bit of context here's one

408
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,040
of my tracker lists so as i mentioned

409
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,959
one of my keywords is privacy in latin

410
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
america so i made this twitter list that

411
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
has a a lot a little bit of follow some

412
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,800
users on privacy in latin america and

413
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,199
what i have here specifically

414
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,040
because i am subject to a lot of

415
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,279
regulations is the regulators it's

416
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,120
straightforward it's i have the

417
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
regulators from peru chile argentina

418
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
mexico who is my old employer and

419
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
colombia

420
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
and basically that is um that and i have

421
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,240
it set up this way because i know

422
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,079
when they publish new regulations when

423
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,680
they publish new guidelines they tend to

424
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
at least share them on twitter or they

425
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
tend to at least share links to them and

426
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,839
that's a way that i can kind of keep

427
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,240
track of when i need to know something

428
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
instead of having to go individually to

429
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,920
each of these websites

430
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,000
i know this is super simple but when

431
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,519
you're like

432
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,120
updating your privacy program and you

433
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
want to check

434
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,519
that everything's in line

435
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,160
these kind of lists can make it very

436
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
a lot easier to find information

437
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,720
and i quite use this list quite a bit

438
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
but you can also go through really niche

439
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,399
lists like i have one that i call gdpr

440
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,519
stuff because

441
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,040
that's a topic for a whole other

442
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
conversation but

443
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
gdpr is kind of the basis for a lot of

444
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,440
latin america and you know much in latin

445
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,959
america and there's a lot more we it's a

446
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,839
lot weaker but um if you follow gdpr

447
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,440
you're kind of in compliance with most

448
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,959
of the regulations

449
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,880
so my organization made the decision to

450
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,279
kind of follow gdpr as the basis for a

451
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
lot of things and i kind of tweaked from

452
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,000
there so i follow a lot of gdpr stuff

453
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
i have what i call my privacy peeps

454
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,440
section which is

455
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,199
experts leaners commissioners people who

456
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,680
tweet about privacy whose content i find

457
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,800
useful and whose nuanced talks um you

458
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
can go with expert list i really

459
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
recommend if you have are subject to any

460
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,959
sort of niche regulations like hipaa or

461
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,560
ccpa

462
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,959
or something like that

463
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,519
make a list out of the niche experts so

464
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
all of the hipaa experts you know and

465
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,480
trust

466
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,920
add them there because that's going to

467
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
be your first

468
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
sort of step in catching up with new

469
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
guidelines with new issues because those

470
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
are the people who are doing the talking

471
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,600
or the organizations you can also

472
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
follow organizations and then i have

473
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
what i call my privacy dumpster fire

474
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,079
list which is my list where i have

475
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,399
everything that doesn't fit neatly it's

476
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,040
kind of like my inbox list where i have

477
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,399
everything that

478
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,959
may go to another sub list but it's a

479
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,079
way of

480
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,720
sort of keeping track of things people

481
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
organizations that i think are useful i

482
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
think are important

483
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,679
but don't think neatly into my other

484
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
boxes and as to how many lists i like to

485
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
use on twitter i like to have that

486
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,199
somewhere between five and eight

487
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,240
um

488
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,599
with each one having up to 12.

489
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,520
um a little less if

490
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
if it's people who tweet a lot but you

491
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,640
want to keep them relatively concise

492
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
because that way you're not getting a

493
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
lot of clutter and a lot of um unless

494
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
you have one person who tweets a lot

495
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,520
then you might make them into a like

496
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
a smaller list

497
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
but

498
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
yeah 10 to 12 is a good number for

499
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,919
people who are tracking and still having

500
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,520
content and keeping up with changes

501
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,640
so in my next slide

502
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
i have here um

503
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,559
a screenshot from my tweet that

504
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,720
tweetdeck is a i think it's a twitter

505
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,799
tool it's a social analytics tool um

506
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
there's some others i've used hootsuite

507
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,600
i've used um hubspot hubspot especially

508
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,799
great if you don't know a lot about

509
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,640
social media because they have some

510
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,360
great tutorials um both of these are you

511
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,320
know not free but they have free trials

512
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,559
so sometimes if you're starting up and

513
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
you just want to figure out who's doing

514
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
the talking on the topics on your

515
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,520
keywords

516
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,919
those are going to be some you know use

517
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,440
those free trials i think social

518
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,919
listening tools basically help you

519
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
gauge where the conversations are on a

520
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,799
given topic for example here i have

521
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
privacy data protection data privacy

522
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
prior to that which is privacy in

523
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,679
spanish and privacy by default

524
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,600
and what i'm doing here is every so

525
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,919
often i'm checking in seeing

526
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
what hashtags are trending how they're

527
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,120
trending

528
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
um getting a little bit of information

529
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
that because that will help me figure

530
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,400
out not just

531
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,520
whether my keyword is right but also

532
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
who is stirring the talking on my

533
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,240
keywords

534
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,120
and

535
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,039
quite frankly are my keywords like

536
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,679
framed exactly the right way for example

537
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,559
i don't have a protection

538
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,240
which is data protection in spanish even

539
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
though that's the main term most

540
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,919
legislators use

541
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,440
because that term doesn't really it's

542
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
not really used on social media so happy

543
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,520
i see that which is kind of a strange

544
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,679
thing but i prefer to have that as my

545
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,200
keyword because even

546
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
across latin america that's what

547
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
regulators will use i'm guessing is a

548
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,039
number of characters in a hashtag issue

549
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,280
because that will influence especially

550
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
non-english

551
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
languages

552
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
so you know you're going to want to play

553
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,520
with social media in this sense um

554
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
you want to see what works and what

555
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
doesn't again

556
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
i've done a lot of trial and error with

557
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,679
this so

558
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,720
you

559
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
it's all it's all about playing with the

560
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,520
systems and how it is easiest for you to

561
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,240
make the information kind of come to you

562
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
and finally i have my beloved rss feeds

563
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
which i know a lot of organizations no

564
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,159
longer support but i still love them

565
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,320
and i love them because it makes them so

566
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,039
easy to go through information i could

567
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,919
just look at like the headline and know

568
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,360
if something's going to be relevant for

569
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,760
me or not um this screenshot is from

570
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
feedly which is an rss reader

571
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,559
i quite like it you can use anything you

572
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,760
want um

573
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,840
i like it i like feeding

574
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
because you can make sort of

575
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
list of just a certain number of people

576
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
you following your feed and if you go to

577
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,320
the top of your feed you'll get all of

578
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,799
their recent publications so you can go

579
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
through things really fast and you can

580
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
save um what you need to save on boards

581
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
and just delete everything else

582
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,000
so

583
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,919
through feedly and just following like

584
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,520
i'd like to follow a lot of regulators

585
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
on daily i like to follow a thinking

586
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
song clearly that makes it very easy to

587
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
just quickly you know go through

588
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,480
information be like oh there's this new

589
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,440
guidelines here oh there's this new um

590
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,000
requirement here oh this decision um

591
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
impacts me here and just kind of save

592
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
that information and jump everything

593
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
else because we don't have the time to

594
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,120
read everything i wish we did but i know

595
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
we don't

596
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,799
and as you do

597
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,840
um you're going to be

598
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
you once you set up your trackers you

599
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,080
want to start establish a period as to

600
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
how often you check in with them

601
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
i like weekly i like checking in with

602
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
them on friday afternoons where things

603
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,400
tend to calm down at my office

604
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
but whatever works for you every two

605
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,039
weeks every three weeks every month um i

606
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,120
recommend at least once to every two

607
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,240
weeks

608
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,320
um you want to eliminate everything that

609
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,880
ceases as fast as possible just get it

610
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,120
out of the way you want to also

611
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,880
establish some set locations while

612
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
you're sure while you restore the

613
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
information that is useful to you

614
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,840
you want to do this so that you're not

615
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
like hunting information like oh i saw

616
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,000
this i think it was here no you like

617
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
have one set location for our sub suites

618
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
one set location for tweets one's a

619
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,919
location for subscriptions um

620
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
folders are great for this

621
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
so that you know that like you're not

622
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
checking ten different sources at most

623
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,080
you're checking three to four binders

624
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,679
and finally you actually want to check

625
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,480
in with these binders or formats or

626
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
folders or whatever you want

627
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
every once in a while and like just go

628
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
through them see what information is

629
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
useful sometimes you'll find you stored

630
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
something

631
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,559
two months ago that might be useful to

632
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,559
you now but wasn't that useful then it

633
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,799
was just like oh this is good to know

634
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,039
and i think that can help you like also

635
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,880
not have to go hunting down for

636
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,520
information

637
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,679
finally we get to the check and next

638
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,559
stage again so with anything you want to

639
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,440
check

640
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
is it working for you um

641
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
it's really hard to gauge on the

642
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,159
abstract um i think the best

643
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,039
way is for you to check your own system

644
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,960
in terms of what you set up

645
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
but you want to see

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
here are some guidance questions like is

647
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,280
it helping or adding to your burden um

648
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
do i have the outcomes i need

649
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,360
am i catching the things like did i

650
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
catch the regulations did i catch the

651
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
fine of the competitor did i catch what

652
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
i needed to catch

653
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,039
are the trackers working for you are

654
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,280
there actually poke posting on what the

655
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
topic of your keyboard is like where my

656
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
example if i were to follow tracker that

657
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,000
had

658
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
instead of privacy

659
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
so data protection instead of privacy i

660
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,039
might not find much

661
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,640
because most of latin america will

662
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,039
actually use the term periwasilda at

663
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,200
least in social media

664
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,039
um are my communication mechanisms

665
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,480
enough are things slipping through the

666
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,159
cracks and i getting the information i

667
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,080
need am i getting too much or too little

668
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
information you're going to tweak that

669
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,480
and based on that you start over in

670
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,600
terms of

671
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,080
act and applying and checking

672
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,000
and you want to be strategic or as you

673
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,720
call it um be a critical kitty i think

674
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
being self-critical is very important

675
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,559
and engaging your work is only good for

676
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,840
you um

677
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,080
in the long run

678
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,520
so finally these are a few lessons

679
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
learned from my experience of all these

680
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,799
years tracking both political

681
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,799
developments and there are now very

682
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,799
specific stuff on privacy

683
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
um simple tools regularly um right that

684
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,919
are well set up and financed and um

685
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,159
simple tools are regularly set up

686
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,240
and well done well applied will be

687
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,799
better than complex tools

688
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,200
i've found this especially with big

689
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,080
organizations they'll have a tools

690
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,360
that they want you to follow but

691
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,279
sometimes the information won't be right

692
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,080
because it's not tailored to you

693
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
and what i like about this stuff it's

694
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,159
all cheap or free like at most you might

695
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,919
want to do a subscription to something

696
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,840
but that's about it i don't subscribe to

697
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,799
anything

698
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,720
everything i've shared of i've paid for

699
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,559
nothing um

700
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,159
be ruthless and eliminating what

701
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,520
information doesn't serve you because

702
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
otherwise you get a lot of clutter

703
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
this is very important when setting up

704
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,520
social media accounts or email accounts

705
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,720
you want to use um

706
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,480
you want to use very specific

707
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
and a specific an account specifically

708
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,279
for that you don't want to use your

709
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,279
regular account or your personal account

710
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
use a soccer account using anonymou

711
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,960
account i'm using the add privacy

712
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,200
penguin account for this and i'm i just

713
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,640
started it for this talk i think i'm

714
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,039
going to start using it for resources so

715
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,360
follow that if you like um

716
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,760
mix and max your trackers and startup

717
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
scale

718
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,039
and

719
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
don't be afraid to scale down

720
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,279
so just because i'm running out of time

721
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,440
here i have some resources

722
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
that i found are useful again it will

723
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,360
depend on your organization but

724
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,640
it is

725
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
just go through it look things up check

726
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
test it out that is my best advice and

727
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,080
hopefully when i talk to you

728
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,919

729
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,600
