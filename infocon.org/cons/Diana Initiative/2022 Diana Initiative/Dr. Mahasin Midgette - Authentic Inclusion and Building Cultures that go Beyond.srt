next slide please

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
today we're going to discuss the problem

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
some theoretical and conceptual lenses

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
and implications for managers that they

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
can take back to the workplace today

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,440
next

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,680
so let's talk about the problem the

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
problem for management is that

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
organizations they're struggling to move

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,159
beyond diversity to become authentically

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,640
inclusive without being authentically

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
inclusive there are so many negative

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,600
outcomes you have turnover loss of

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
talent loss of profit it could be a

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
toxic work environment

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
you have low work productivity

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
mental health challenges and more

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
two major factors that contribute to

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
organizations not being authentically

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
inclusive are implicit racial bias

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
and implicit gender bias research has

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
shown that both implicit racial and

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,320
implicit gender bias

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
is just as relevant today as it's been

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
years ago

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,680
managers have not been able to

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
successfully combat these negative

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
factors because the right frameworks and

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,880
initiatives are not in place

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
leadership of managers must find new

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,000
ways

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
to move an organization in a positive

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
way and to be able to accept the

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,159
cultural change that is needed

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
diversity and inclusion in the workplace

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,399
can help all employees

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
to feel accepted and valued when

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,040
employees feel accepted and valued they

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
are happier and they stay longer with

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,319
the company

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
a diverse workforce will help an

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
organization not only fulfill customer

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,560
needs but also improve its business

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
reputation

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,319
diversity can increase employee morale

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
and instill a desire to be more

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,879
effective and work more efficiently

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
this will greatly increase overall

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
production for the business

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,319
when learning about an organization

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,959
inclusion is the prerequisite for the

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,120
functioning of a diverse workforce and

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
it involves the full and successful

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
integration of diverse people into the

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,599
workplace

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,720
with that

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
leadership has a major role in the

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,040
organizational culture leadership in the

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
organizational culture shape the

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,959
characteristics of an organization

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,400
as well as make or break the

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
organization

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
leadership is a skill used to influence

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
followers and an organization to work

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
willingly towards goals specifically

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
intended for the organization's common

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
good and for individual betterment

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,840
as such diversity implications for

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
leaders and managers are vital and the

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
role leadership must take servant

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,879
leadership by putting people first to

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
help an organization become

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
authentically inclusive inclusive

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
next we're going to discuss three

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
frameworks in a conceptual framework

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
next slide please

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
next slide please

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
this first figure shows servant

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
leadership theory by robert greenleaf

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,440
servant leadership is a vital role which

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
must come first

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
for change and also will assist with

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
initiating other frameworks for change

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
within the organization

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,640
it is very important to understand why

104
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
this framework is first and how it can

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,519
help

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,040
employees must have someone that they

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,360
can follow and who else better than a

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,760
leader who puts others first

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,120
when an employee feels they have

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
psychological safety they are more

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
accepting to change

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
so how do you obtain that safety net for

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
employees by having the right leader in

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,640
place

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
employees are the greatest asset of an

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,839
organization and to enforce that feeling

117
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
of being the greatest asset servant

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
leaders make sure employees feel they

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
are the greatest asset and they are

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
recognized for being the greatest except

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
servant leadership is a philosophy and a

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
set of practices

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,120
that enriches lives of individuals

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
builds better organizations and

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,199
ultimately it creates a more just and

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
caring world

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
servant leadership begins with the

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
natural feeling of a person to serve

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
first

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,479
which also brings on the aspiration to

131
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
lead in order to become a great leader

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,199
one should understand the position of

133
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,400
serving

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,840
and in different aspects of their

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
organization

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
the servant leader will also focus on

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
the growth and well-being of the people

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
and the communities in which they belong

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
that's very important traditional

140
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
leadership exercises power from the top

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
of the pyramid and they're more

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
authoritative however servant leaders

143
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
share power while putting the others the

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
needs of others first

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,560
this type of leader helps develop and

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
helps individuals perform to the highest

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
level possible this not only helps the

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,400
individuals reach goals but

149
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
organizational goals as well a critical

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
factor

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
for understanding the success of an

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
organization are leaders

153
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,639
the servant leadership very is a

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,360
framework that an organization can use

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
as a culture structure that will help an

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
organization move in that right

157
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,440
direction

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
when leaders are dealing with implicit

159
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
and racial bias

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
those leaders must strategically

161
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,639
position themselves

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
throughout the organization to help

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
change the culture

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
next slide please

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,039
this figure is the organizational

166
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,479
culture framework by edgar shine

167
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,400
this figure shows

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,120
five small outer circles all feeding

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
into the organizational culture which is

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
at the center

171
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
then the organizational culture is

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
feeding back

173
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
into those outer circles one cannot

174
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
happen without the other

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,440
this very presents basically three

176
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
levels of the organizational's culture

177
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
which are necessary to understand

178
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,759
in order

179
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
to have an effective leadership and

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
organizational culture flow so first you

181
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,680
have the artifacts the artifacts are

182
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
surface cultures you have such as how we

183
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,440
dress

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
where it's something that is known but

185
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
it's not something that's easy to

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,479
decipher

187
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,960
then you have espoused values which are

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
conscious goals strategies philosophies

189
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
and then last you have basic assumptions

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
which are unconscious beliefs and values

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,560
that form the core of the culture and

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,520
everything that we do

193
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
culture is how things are done

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
in the workplace if the culture is

195
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
negative and toxic then the employees of

196
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
the organization will be unyielding to

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,720
diversity and inclusion practices values

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,000
are very important for the

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
organizational culture

200
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,759
the most successful change programs

201
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
reveal that large organizations

202
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,639
connect with their people most directly

203
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
through values and that the values are

204
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,639
ultimately about beliefs and feelings

205
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,000
this framework allows for the

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
organization to freeze in place

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,280
and to look at the importance of change

208
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
several factors come into play when

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,599
discussing the overall culture such as

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,840
deliberate role modeling

211
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
teaching and coaching by leaders this

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
takes us back to where the servant

213
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
leadership can lead by example at its

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
best

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,199
because leaders are role models and

216
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,800
teach employees

217
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
leaders behaviors can be expected to

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
have a significant impact

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
in communicating the organization's

220
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,720
culture

221
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
every day culture is being formed and

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,759
every day is an opportunity for positive

223
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
influential change by the right leaders

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
in place

225
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
next slide please

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
here you have what is called the

227
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
diversity management framework

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
the diversity management framework has

229
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,000
two components institutional theory and

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
resource theory they focus on the macro

231
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
and micro levels of the organization

232
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,679
here is where you will have leaders

233
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
working with individuals to make sure

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,799
these policies are put into place and

235
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,679
are communicated out to the organization

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,279
correctly

237
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,760
diversity management uses applied

238
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
behavioral science methodology

239
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
research and vary

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,640
and is to manage organizational change

241
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
and stability processes

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
that support the diversity in the

243
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,040
organization and it also eliminates

244
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
oppression to improve the health and

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
effectiveness of an organization but it

246
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
also affirms the values of respect for

247
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
human differences

248
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,680
social justice participation community

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
authenticity which is very important

250
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
lifelong learning and more

251
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,200
being that diversity management is a

252
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,720
cross-disciplinary field organizations

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
can easily use this theory as its own

254
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,320
framework

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
different human experiences provide an

256
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,959
organization

257
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,480
with a benefit for diversity

258
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
diversity management also incorporates

259
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
values

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
which in turn comes from the

261
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,640
organizational culture leadership and

262
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
management

263
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
the different cultural perspective and

264
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
work styles

265
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
of all employees lead to a widening and

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
reframing of the issues around what work

267
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
the organization does and how the

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,839
organization does it which is very

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,040
important

270
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,959
when you focus on the institutional

271
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,279
dairy aspect that draws attention to the

272
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
role that social forces play in

273
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
influencing

274
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
organizational actions

275
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
including how organizations seek and

276
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,440
gain legitimacy

277
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
this deals with the structure of the

278
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
organization that will include employees

279
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
behaviors factors of laws rules

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
regulations and social and professional

281
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
norms

282
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,120
the resource theory

283
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,279
this aspect draws on organizational

284
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,079
resources so you have financial

285
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,720
physical capital human capital and

286
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,959
diversity management practices

287
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
this very has implications on diversity

288
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,079
management practices which is the set of

289
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
formalized practices

290
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
developed and implemented by

291
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,320
organizations to manage diversity

292
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
effectively

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
the alignment of these theories are

294
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,160
critical because if organic

295
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,640
organizations underestimate the value of

296
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,040
diversity then the organization will

297
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
make insufficient investments in

298
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
diversity management

299
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,079
if there are different views of

300
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
diversity because of lack of diversity

301
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,440
frameworks and initiatives that can

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
negatively affect diversity management

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,279
practices as a whole

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
and organizational effectiveness in that

305
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
organization we have all seen

306
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
when

307
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
employees have different views because

308
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
it has not been communicated correctly

309
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
because it is not in writing because

310
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
they don't have nobody that they're able

311
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
to follow to help them understand

312
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
what is important

313
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
where it's important how diversity

314
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
inclusion comes to help the organization

315
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
and how can overall help the employees

316
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,839
at its best

317
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,399
next slide please

318
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,079
so what you see here is a conceptual

319
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,120
framework

320
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
this figure shows all three theories

321
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,639
working together

322
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,360
servant leadership comes together with

323
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
diversity management and they feed into

324
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
the organizational culture

325
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,600
both diversity and leadership help form

326
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,320
the culture without both in place the

327
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
organization will face challenges which

328
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,839
are going to ultimately

329
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,200
lead to failure of becoming

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
authentically inclusive

331
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
as you can see the servant leader

332
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
portion shows not only the individual

333
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
goals but also organizational goals

334
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
that feed back into the culture this is

335
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
very important because if these goals

336
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,200
are not being met and they're not

337
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
feeding back into the culture this is

338
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
not a positive functioning organization

339
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,639
but however when it all works together

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,160
it in turn leads to positive

341
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,240
organizational culture business

342
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,880
satisfaction and performance

343
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
with the right policy in place it holds

344
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,959
the organization accountable

345
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
next slide please

346
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
so now

347
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
let's talk about

348
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,120
what we can do right now for change

349
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,839
first to assist we have to change

350
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,600
first to assist with change against

351
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
implicit racial and gender bias an

352
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,399
organization will need a leadership team

353
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,760
this leadership team will help

354
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
facilitate that cultural shift that is

355
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,800
needed

356
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
since followers take their behaviors

357
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
quest from leadership there must be a

358
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,320
leadership foundation in place that

359
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
reflects the organization's cultural

360
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,440
goals

361
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,079
true diversity frameworks and programs

362
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,639
go beyond just regular talks and minimum

363
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,880
training and you know they have actual

364
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
change agents in place

365
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
leaders can overcome the shortcomings of

366
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,160
prior failed programs and frameworks

367
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
as such one option is to have this team

368
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
and on this team the main leader should

369
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,199
be a servant leader

370
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,120
those in the past who have who have

371
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
social

372
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,360
you know

373
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
major social media movements house

374
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
uh similar attributes to those of

375
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
servant leaders for example

376
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
you have mother teresa

377
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,079
she dictated her life to serving other

378
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,040
people like other servant leaders no one

379
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,959
can question her motives beyond her

380
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,079
desire to help others

381
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,240
this team can also consist of multiple

382
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,639
leaders with different leadership styles

383
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
as other leaders first focus on the

384
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
business a servant leader focuses on

385
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
individuals first

386
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,639
when you bring them together to

387
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
collaborate that will allow for the

388
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
leaders to not only work together but

389
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,800
also break down the barriers in order to

390
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,519
become authentic because you must have

391
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
one group of leaders to focus on the

392
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
individuals the others to focus on the

393
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,839
the business and they bridge those gaps

394
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
to make them work cohesively together

395
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
the team will focus on an understanding

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
of cultural competency

397
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,800
as a prerequisite for understanding the

398
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
role of diversity and inclusion within

399
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,399
the organization

400
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
the team will foster a psychological

401
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,920
safety net while promoting inclusivity

402
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,839
and diversity maturity

403
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,880
the goal is to instill inclusivity

404
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
in the organization's mission and the

405
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,519
values the team will demonstrate good

406
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,440
character and their willingness to

407
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
understand

408
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,800
the importance of incorporating

409
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,360
diversity the team will also develop a

410
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
new culture that allows organizational

411
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,399
members to participate

412
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
in and promote an inclusive work

413
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
environment for all

414
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,959
next slide please

415
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
so what we have here

416
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
is a diversity and inclusion framework

417
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,440
every organization needs this framework

418
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,839
there is a lot to discuss so we're just

419
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
going to focus on the top parts

420
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
this framework should include topics and

421
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
policies at both the macro and micro

422
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
levels such as the ones we discussed

423
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
earlier as well as the workforce

424
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
psychological needs which will improve

425
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,639
strategy effectiveness

426
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
an organization is like a puzzle where

427
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
leaders must put the correct pieces

428
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,560
together in order to have a finished

429
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
picture

430
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
the leadership team which we just

431
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
discussed will assist with the framework

432
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,839
and utilize the diversity management

433
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
theory to help steer the organization in

434
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,839
the right direction

435
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,639
human resources senior leaders

436
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,360
and managers all should play a key role

437
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
in building a diversity-friendly

438
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
organization

439
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,639
and enforcing how that organization

440
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,040
should run therefore all would have a

441
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,519
hand in this framework and that that's

442
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,959
only a couple of individuals that need

443
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
to be in this framework you will also

444
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,079
need

445
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
a lot of leadership from top levels and

446
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,199
managers like ceos and presidents to

447
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
really understand because this should be

448
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
covered not only at the level of the

449
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,279
employees but at the top as well

450
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,680
organizations must understand that just

451
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
because they mention or have a policy

452
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,759
about diversity does not necessarily

453
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,639
mean that they are diverse or inclusive

454
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
key components for diversity and

455
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,399
inclusion framework start with diversity

456
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
and then you add inclusion combining the

457
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,279
two will create a framework for the

458
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,440
organization to succeed in many

459
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
different aspects

460
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
those aspects can range from reputation

461
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
to profit

462
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
part of this framework is influencing

463
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,760
organizational behaviors that start at

464
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
the top of an organization the

465
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
organization should put specific people

466
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,480
in top positions that will help the

467
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
organization to succeed and serve again

468
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
this is where your servant leadership

469
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
comes in servant leaders will serve as

470
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,280
the type to help communicate the

471
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
messages that are needed from this

472
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
framework and throughout policies

473
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,679
other areas you will want to focus on

474
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
will be employees behavior you have

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,400
factors of law you have rules regulation

476
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,559
and social and professional norms

477
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,480
this framework should also include

478
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
strategy design to match business

479
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
objectives and policy that aligns the

480
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
organization's objectives with a

481
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,799
strategy strategy on diversity diversity

482
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,760
initiatives policies and frameworks all

483
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,960
must be

484
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,520
included to match the overall business

485
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,799
objectives

486
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,280
each organization is unique

487
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
to so exactly what is needed will be

488
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
different per organization however

489
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
having everything in writing and

490
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,799
aligning with business strategies will

491
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,640
prove successful

492
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,039
next slide please

493
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,360
and finally here we have training

494
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
training is always important with

495
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
anything new incorporating you know

496
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,799
anything you have from diversity to

497
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,799
inclusion to understanding biases or

498
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,360
anything that could be a barrier

499
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,679
a current practice right now current

500
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,919
practices that organizations have is to

501
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
have their employees complete maybe a

502
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,120
one-time training just annually however

503
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,360
one-time training is not enough it does

504
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
not lead to lasting change nor does it

505
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,679
reflect a deep commitment to becoming

506
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
authentically inclusive structural

507
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,480
racism cannot be overcome by picking

508
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,799
once a year online training the

509
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,480
organization must engage with employees

510
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,559
on an ongoing basis

511
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,880
and respond to their experiences

512
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
diversity training is a step forward

513
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
however with specific diversity training

514
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
targeted to deal with identified

515
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
organizational shortfalls

516
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,160
employees become more aware of implicit

517
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,799
bias and other barriers to diversity

518
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,400
and inclusion

519
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
this motivates positive behaviors and

520
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,400
attitudes which are essential for

521
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
creating and maintaining a respectful

522
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
and inclusive environment

523
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
to assist an organization can hire a

524
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
third party assistant with subject

525
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
matter experts who understand behavioral

526
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
challenges and resistant and who also

527
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
have the expertise in training against

528
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
biases

529
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
in today's world being diverse and

530
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,280
inclusive is

531
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
not part of the industry culture and

532
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
requires a fundamental

533
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
shift in behavior

534
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,559
changing someone's bias requires a form

535
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,600
of interruption and repetition

536
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
it's like you know you have a

537
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
two-year-old and you have to tell them

538
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,760
no it's repetition they hear the word no

539
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,840
and then they finally understand okay

540
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
this must change

541
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
this can be done through

542
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
um action oriented training these

543
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,919
experts will work with leaders

544
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,880
and teach and provide the training

545
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,200
next i recommend you have a diversity

546
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
training task force

547
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
it is noted that one training effort is

548
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,640
not enough to change behavior and can

549
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
harm diversity efforts

550
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,080
by creating more bias against

551
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
underrepresented groups an option is for

552
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
an organization to have

553
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
a diversity training task force who will

554
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
help the organization with training by

555
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,960
incorporating diversity goals into

556
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
performance plans

557
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
this task force would work with

558
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,440
leadership teams and management

559
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,159
then we have manager training

560
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
managers are responsible for hiring

561
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,480
promoting and firing

562
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
key to the role

563
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
is moving an organization from diversity

564
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,200
to

565
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
uh inclusion is understanding how they

566
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,440
are a standard bearer of the

567
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
organization's culture

568
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,679
codes of conduct and policies for their

569
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
teams

570
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,559
managers like leaders lead by example

571
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,159
though their daily interactions with

572
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,720
employees managers are dealing with

573
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,240
diversity

574
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
issues they have interpersonal conflicts

575
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,600
and overall organizational challenges

576
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
therefore managers and how they are

577
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,640
trained are critical to the organization

578
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,919
finally if the organization is trying to

579
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,120
lay out

580
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,760
different forms of training you can have

581
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,600
a pilot program

582
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,039
and it's recommended that you start

583
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,360
these programs in phases the

584
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,120
organization can have about one to three

585
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,280
pilot programs at once in different

586
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,320
areas to test out how the training can

587
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,000
work and then you can measure the

588
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
outcomes examples of measured outcomes

589
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,120
is how does the employee feel valued are

590
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
they now feeling valued now that they've

591
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
had more training and others have had

592
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,400
more training

593
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
how are policies being measured are

594
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
those policies now proven to be

595
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,080
successful do you have the right data in

596
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
place to measure the outcome

597
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,440
successfully of implementing new policy

598
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
how have best practices been ingrained

599
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,280
into the organization so measuring for

600
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,840
success is very important once you are

601
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
laying all this out

602
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,600
key is that training starts when an

603
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,520
employee on boards and then it is

604
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,039
consistently

605
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,000
every

606
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,720
month quarterly yearly as long as an

607
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
employee is there and new training is

608
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
there and reflective training is there

609
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
to offer to you know more information

610
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,919
about diversity and inclusion and to

611
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,400
make the organization's values

612
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,080
and commitment to diversity and

613
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
inclusion clear

cultures that go beyond diversity by

620
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
using servant leadership to put people
