245
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
cats we have a puma we have a

246
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,600
panther we have

247
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
a

248
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,240
tiger there

249
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
symbolizing us ready to take that

250
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,560
initiative getting on the prowl getting

251
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
because we've been kind of trapped for

252
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
the last couple of years i mean let's be

253
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
honest right we're all been kind of

254
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,680
stuffed in and trying to make sure you

255
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,519
know kind of keep in our little bubbles

256
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,120
but this year we're trying to come out

257
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,040
take that initiative seize

258
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
the moment really um

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
and

260
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
this year um our logo actually feed

261
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
because every year we ever have

262
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
um

263
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
our logo it features a mythical animal

264
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,480
um and it emboldens the spirit and

265
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
tagline of what our collective mood is

266
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,360
and

267
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
rick and recording obviously as i

268
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
mentioned previous events

269
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,360
um you know we like them the

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
the metaphors so we

271
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
had metaphors about metamorphosis

272
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,399
overcoming adversity and emerging just

273
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
stronger

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
in 2019 obviously our

275
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
logo was the rising phoenix it became a

276
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
main crest which actually

277
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
we consistently use behind our brand um

278
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,560
in 2020 we had an abstract butterfly uh

279
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
with a feminine and celebratory cultural

280
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,160
vibe in 2021 well as the pandemic kept

281
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,880
wearing on uh it's the asymmetry

282
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
asymmetrical

283
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,880
uh progression of oregon cranes um and

284
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,160
reflected a feeling of longing um

285
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,880
impertinence and and optimism

286
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,680
and this year as i said um it's time to

287
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
stop isolating and start acting taking

288
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
those moments like seizing that moment

289
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
um and this year it's also the year of

290
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
the tigers so it really really plays

291
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,560
into our

292
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
and like our theme uh we're coming out

293
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
again and it's time to take that

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,920
initiative

295
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,639
and help build a more inclusive infosec

296
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,959
industry um and the jungle cats

297
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,480
represent our diverse community

298
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
inspiring us to move forward take what's

299
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
ours

300
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,399
we are rare we are fearsome hunters we

301
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
are fiercely protective of one another

302
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,079
here in our community and we are

303
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,839
stronger together

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,560
so collectively we all can roar together

305
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
um

306
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
so that's kind of like the explanation

307
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
of why you're going to see cats not only

308
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
here but also in our

309
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,320
in-person event and that's why you see

310
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
cats kind of hidden here or there on all

311
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880

324
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,480
can't create a community if we all kind

325
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,399
of isolate ourselves so help spread the

326
