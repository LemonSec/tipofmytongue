1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,240
all right so

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,319
if you want to join the diana initiative

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,320
discord server

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,080
you are going to need to go to

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
discord.com

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,280
download

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
it for your computer

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,279
then click login

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
and then on the login page

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
you're going to want to

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,680
register and make a new account if you

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,439
don't already have one email username

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,119
password

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,560
if you already have an account you'll

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
want to log in

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,880
if you're logging in for the first time

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
it's going to say hey

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
you want to join a specific server

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,079
at that point you can copy the

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,600
invitation

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
link

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,519
that you have

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
say join

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
or you can just skip that step and after

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,320
you skip that step

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
you can paste

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
the url in your browser

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
and it'll again bring you to

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,960
the

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,358
server

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
if you're not getting that message make

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,439
sure that you're logged in

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
and make sure that your discord app is

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,560
up to date

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
once you get here

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
the carlbot

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
says hey welcome

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,040
gotta go to verify

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
and you need to pass the verification

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,439
first

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
to

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,079
complete a few more steps oops

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
and let me verify my email

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
and then read all the terms and

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,560
conditions

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
once i say that i've read

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,880
the rules

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,119
and

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,399
right i just verified the email so

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
there we go i can't submit

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
now i can click verify

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
once i do

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
verify

54
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
i need to check my dms so here we go as

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
the wickbot has dm'd me

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
please type the

57
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,800
captcha below

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,079
all right

59
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,319
if i go back here suddenly i can see all

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,640
the attendee and sponsor rooms yay

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
now

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
if

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,959
i did not get the dm from the bot

64
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,200
i would want to check my user settings

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,599
and see

66
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
privacy and safety

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
allow direct messages from server

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
members so make sure that's turned on if

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,519
you have that turned off you may not get

70
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
the verification email so after that you

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
should be able to pop into the different

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,040
channels

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,360
if you do need a

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
speaker

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
or sponsor or other role or there's a

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,799
code of conduct violation you want to

77
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,720
report just go over to submit a ticket

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
here on the left-hand side

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,799
and then you make a general support

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,760
ticket

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
a role request or code of conduct

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
violation

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,279
hopefully this helps
