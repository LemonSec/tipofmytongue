8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,480

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,800
about how to sign up for shifts

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,760
so the url right here is the

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
uh link to our event

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,280

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,840
you scroll down uh they're based off a

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
time and day

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
and they have a little description about

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,760
the role

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039

platform

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
and we can kind of do all each at the

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
same time

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080

characters

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520

then you just have to uh agree to their

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,599
terms of service

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,000

account

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
so now uh it's going to verify email and

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,120
it's going to send me a little

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,360
verification to my address

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
i have another page open to that that's

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
off screen because i don't really want

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
to share my email

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,519
so

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,879
what you'll just get an email and it

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,440
will have a big orange link in it and it

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,959
will say verify your email and all you

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,760
have to do is click on it

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
and when you do that you're gonna and

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
you've done it successfully you'll see a

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,280
little picture that looks like

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,200
this so once that's verified you can

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
just click out of that

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
you can scroll back down again with the

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,159
shifts you've selected

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
oh you have to reselect the shift it

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
looks like all right so

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
let me just pick out another one here

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
staff registration again yeah

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,959
so then you need to go back down here

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,239
and then we can sign up with points

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,680
since we've already created our calculus

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,159
point

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,519
now it's going to ask you to complete

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,159
your profile before you can actually

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
sign up for a shift

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
uh these are based off of united states

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
addresses but you don't have to put in

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
anything legitimate again

90
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,159
uh

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,120
just say

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879

94
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720

um you just have to put in some digits

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,160
here uh it's going to be

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
actually let you change the country yeah

99
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
you to choose some causes uh

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
generally ones you're interested in so

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,680
it gives you a little bit of selection

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
there and you pick three

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
and then you click save

106
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,400

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,639
options of male female and non-binary

108
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
that

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
and then it's going to give you some

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
information here it's going to give you

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
information about the shift what time it

116
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,600

or a multiple shifts

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
one of the important things with this uh

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,280
app too is we you want to make sure you

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,639
just don't double book yourself so

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,039
that's something to keep in mind

125
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,000
now if i log out

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
and i just go to

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,759

129
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,639

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
basically and so if you want to manage

133
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,400
your shifts or if something has changed

134
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
and you need to change things

135
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280

can say change or cancel

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
so say i can't do staff registration

142
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,880
