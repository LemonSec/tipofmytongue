[Music]

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,280
all right so this is this is hot off the

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,379
presses work it actually just started

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,890
working on this last night I am I have

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,660
an adapter a power adapter that's

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,880
European standard into a white blob that

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,920
goes into an outlet and if I'm all ants

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,810
on it it's gonna lose power so we'll see

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,090
if we get through this demo alive

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,969
so last night I took this PC engines to

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,530
and I flashed into it a kernel and in a

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,030
couple of you root tools and it barely

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,210
fit and then I discovered that I

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,860
couldn't do anything at all on the

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,590
serial port and I did not care and let

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,930
me get into why I did not care assuming

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,030
that the Dark Angel of demos does not

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,300
visit me the reason I did not care is

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,340
because I had the ultimate serial port

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,129
which is also known as Ethernet in my

21
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,559
favor now what I want to show you is

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,060
what was in the you root oh yes thank

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,360
you thank you sorry about that

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,710
so so the reason is I I heard the

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,509
ultimate serial interface which is of

26
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,030
course Ethernet and you know I can CPU

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,799
to that node and what is the CPU I'm

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,009
gonna get into that but you know here is

29
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,780
the sum total of the you route programs

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,000
I have on this machine which connects

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
like about a dozen and yet somehow I'm

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,960
running bash in LS and all this good

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,759
stuff and you know cuz that's a bash

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,189
prompt that's not bash anywhere in the

35
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,170
flash part you know and how did that

36
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,030
work well I start the CPU command and

37
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,619
I'll show that moving parts in a minute

38
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,100
on on another slide and and what happens

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,170
is on the client side which is the

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,659
dollar sign prompt it establishes a

41
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,180
connection to a CPU running in the PC

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,790
engines and it also kicks off a 9p

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,130
server in the background and it does all

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,219
its ssh foofaraw and the server actually

45
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,489
does a ninety mount back to my side to

46
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,378
my nine piece server running as me

47
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,989
and mounts my namespace which in this

48
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,930
case is the root

49
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,810
of the node I'm coming from one temp CPU

50
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,939
and then these are bind mounts of

51
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,129
binding very mounting various things in

52
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:26,109
my PC engines Linux so that when that

53
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,299
CPU command running on the PC engines

54
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,989
execs been bash been bash is actually

55
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,439
found because been yeah trying to type

56
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,439
you know bin bash is a bind mount to

57
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,109
temp CPU bin which is mounted you know

58
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:46,180
over temp CPU back to the machine I came

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,609
from and what this means is you know

60
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,680
like oh I need to run flash ROM but darn

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
it I didn't put flash ROM in my spy

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,939
flash it really doesn't matter because

63
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,549
flash ROM is on the machine I came from

64
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:00,189
and that's mounted via 9p so what this

65
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:02,290
basically means is I can do stuff like

66
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,859
CD and now I'm in you know home our

67
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,260
minnak and all my stuff is there and I

68
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,900
can do flash ROM - or in a file and it

69
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,480
ends up on the machine I came from and I

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,129
can proceed to mess around with the file

71
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,900
in the machine I came from right so I

72
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,739
didn't have to SCP anything anywhere the

73
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,750
file system namespace in the machine I

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,579
came from is completely visible on this

75
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:30,090
PC engines so this is a plan 9 concept

76
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,680
and we've been working on you route now

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,720
for eight years and the go packages have

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,370
been growing in capability and just

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,010
within the last year or so we got a go

80
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,229
package for SSH that was perfect for the

81
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,870
client side and then we also got this is

82
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,639
the funny part we got to go package for

83
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,500
SSH it was perfect on the server side

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,180
because it it implemented port

85
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,069
redirection and we were kind of able

86
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,409
assemble the CPU command that uses lots

87
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,199
of various bits and and the end result

88
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,379
is that I can have you know almost

89
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,870
nothing in the spy I have a few key

90
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,659
pieces I have a DHCP client and I have

91
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,579
the CPU come in which runs is actually

92
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,400
in it on this machine this PC engines

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,889
and then when I CPU in I don't lose

94
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,750
anything by going in there like when is

95
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,579
this a chin you know I'd have nothing

96
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,798
when I CPU in I've got every bin on the

97
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,349
machine including VI and Emacs and all

98
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:23,409
the good stuff I'm used to so it's just

99
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,389
this is such a now look there's some

100
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,889
performance here you can kind of see

101
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:27,699
when I hit it

102
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,020
try and run a command there's a

103
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,749
teeny-tiny little delay here right while

104
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,310
it pulls it over that oh well it's not

105
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,479
that much of a delay ball pulls it over

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,650
the net but what's kind of cool is at

107
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,729
some point where you're working in this

108
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,229
and you kind of forget that you're doing

109
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:43,419
all these commands in your login

110
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,639
directory but you're actually running

111
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,020
all in a little box down here that's

112
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,819
what I was doing last night I did the

113
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,159
flash ROM - char and I just ran CB FS

114
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,810
tool I just typed it out of habit and it

115
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,219
was a second later that I realized oh

116
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:54,849
wait a minute

117
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,069
I was running that on a PC engines but

118
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,930
it was modifying files you know on my

119
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,689
Linux machine so how does all this get

120
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,650
wired together you know and I know a lot

121
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,629
of people don't know this but alpheios

122
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,909
was a big 9 fan back in a day and added

123
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,289
thanks to Linux it made this possible

124
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,819
but so we have the penguin and we have

125
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,830
the gopher and that gives us the bunny

126
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,159
meaning you know the plan 9 bunny that's

127
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,419
the space bunny because it's more

128
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,779
advanced than the old days so you type a

129
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,000
come in it looks like an ssh but unlike

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,520
all an ssh when you go to that remote

131
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,409
machine all your stuff kind of travels

132
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,189
with you and yes it looks like NF has

133
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:34,419
home directories there are a few

134
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,759
differences unfortunately the serial

135
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,139
console is broken or I'd show you but

136
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,419
these are private namespace mounts which

137
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,610
means all the mounts that happen are not

138
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,830
visible outside that initial process and

139
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,569
it's children so if you go into the

140
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:48,490
machine as you you will not see my temp

141
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,469
CPU and I will not see your temp CPU

142
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,680
those were private namespace mounts and

143
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,659
it's served by your server so you don't

144
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,330
have to go to the operator from hell and

145
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,580
say please set up at NFS server because

146
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,689
I want to do this thing

147
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,460
it's your an IP server running as you

148
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,469
and that further means that even though

149
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:06,849
this is a hash prompt because I'm

150
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,710
running his route here that did not give

151
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,419
me special privileges on the machine I

152
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,729
came from so all those old defenses from

153
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,069
the old days with NFS where oh my god

154
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,479
your route here and you man it there and

155
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,949
I've got to protect myself against you

156
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,689
because your route that's not an issue

157
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,490
there are no sort of privilege

158
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,439
escalations because I'm root on the PC

159
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,409
engines and you know there's all kinds

160
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:32,860
of fun stuff that the APU - in this case

161
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,180
comes up it's not a general-purpose

162
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,800
machine it's a machine that knows how to

163
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,750
do one and only one thing be a CPU

164
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,690
server so plan nine hackers everywhere

165
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,140
happy

166
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,470
including me let me just do the sort of

167
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,050
bits and pieces so kind of what happened

168
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,980
there is I ice-type CPU blah blah blah

169
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,230
and it started an IP server and a

170
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,820
forwarding goroutine that's just a

171
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,410
thread and you know outside the go

172
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,270
universe and on the right side there

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,760
there's my CPU running as an it and it

174
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,950
kicks off a th client and listens on

175
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,280
port 22 here's the 9p server this is

176
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,350
actually a rust 9p server because it's a

177
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,630
beautifully written 9p server from I

178
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,700
forget who did that and then there's an

179
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,420
IP packet forwarder and then you know my

180
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,850
client does a connect over remote with

181
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,840
SSH protocol that guy doesn't accept and

182
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,090
then I start listening on that 9p port

183
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,770
forward then I'm gonna talk to the

184
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,690
remote thing and set up this redirect

185
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,540
why do I set up a redirect I'm gonna do

186
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,610
a kernel amount here and I'm gonna give

187
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,710
it an IP address and a port and that

188
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,240
that port will be the thing that goes

189
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,960
through this redirection and then once

190
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,450
that redirection happens this CPU

191
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,760
command knows to do an amount of 9p on

192
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,100
temp CPU and do the buying mounts why do

193
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,660
I have to do the bind mounts because

194
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,700
even if you try and set load library

195
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,620
path there's just too many dependencies

196
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,470
in the Linux stuff nowadays on you know

197
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,030
you can't say go to there it's gonna

198
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,890
always want to go there and same with

199
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,080
the various bins so I didn't want to do

200
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,460
the bind mounts but there's no choice

201
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,220
because of the way the binary tools work

202
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,630
and then finally in execs the command

203
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,730
and if there kind of is no command then

204
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,020
it looks up dollar shell in the

205
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,520
environment which we also forward it

206
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,460
across that's been bash been bash fall

207
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,830
is this you know set of bind mounts

208
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,870
through 9p and pulls the bin bash binary

209
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,280
and also libraries over the 9p

210
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,020
connection and we're running the bin

211
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,090
bash I want to run now there's some fun

212
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,460
stuff here I'm allowed to make this be

213
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,900
anything I want if you're worried about

214
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,120
access I can add this serve a filesystem

215
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,539
out of a CPI oh no problem that's that's

216
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,309
a solved problem with from 30 years ago

217
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,470
so you don't have to serve it from a

218
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,909
filesystem you can serve it from

219
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,190
anything that's sort of a source of data

220
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,290
so that's kind of cool too and so then

221
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,620
we just do our normal SSH and yes these

222
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,910
talks go fast I'm done

223
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,870
so that's kind of the talk one last

224
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,900
thing if you anyone who ever did NFS

225
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,240
root you remember watching like a

226
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,010
network connection get flaky and then a

227
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,990
thousand machines suddenly say NFS

228
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,760
server not responding still trying and

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,020
then just watching your whole datacenter

230
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,120
collapsing a burning smoke of smoking

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,320
heap this 9p thing is mine IP server my

232
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,050
cpu client my cpu server you can blow

233
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,270
that stuff out of the water I've done it

234
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,770
a couple times because this is so flaky

235
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,990
and that PC engines keeps running and I

236
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,340
reconnect the network and I can do

237
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,680
another CPU session this is nothing like

238
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,950
sort of NFS root Follies from back in a

239
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,570
day this is much much more durable

240
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,660
system so I really if there's interest

241
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,030
in this in this group where do I need

242
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,460
help i need help with performance I'm

243
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,930
not gonna run Emacs because it takes an

244
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,490
embarrassing with the amount long amount

245
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,500
of time to come up you know I can run

246
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,390
this thing called god IT and that's

247
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,070
really how you say it the guy who wrote

248
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,110
he told me you know and that kind of

249
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,520
comes up pretty quick and it kind of

250
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,620
looks like Emacs but you know if you

251
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,810
have a lot of files going on you've got

252
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,070
correctness year but you don't have the

253
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,750
kind of performance I'd like to have I

254
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,850
am running the FS cache it doesn't seem

255
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,350
to be quite doing what I hoped it would

256
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,840
do so anybody wants to educate me on how

257
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,340
to make this perform better I'd love to

258
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,750
have the help but it is really I'd

259
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,400
forgotten how nice this was from back in

260
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,930
a day when it's a playing nine guy it's

261
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,570
just incredibly nice to CPU to a machine

262
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,700
and just have everything there to have

263
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,200
it not really look any different than

264
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,240
the Machine you came from so you know if

265
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,560
you're at all interested I'd really

266
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,200
recommend you give it a shot so that is

267
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,690
that I can type commands if you want me

268
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,720
to alright thank you very much

269
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,800
so we have the microphones back if you

270
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,810
have any questions please feel free how

271
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,380
does the cross-compile story look like

272
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,430
it's actually real good because

273
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,800
following the way playing I always did

274
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,230
things if I have a route like / AMD I

275
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,480
could start that 9p server and make /

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,430
AMD the root of the namespace and all

277
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,860
the binaries just work so again this is

278
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,040
this is literally a solved problem I

279
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,560
actually have by the way getting back to

280
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,540
embarrassing yeah I have done it go run

281
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,410
in here and it takes a little longer

282
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,760
than I'd like a lot of files go ahead do

283
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,770
you need service of a kind of support

284
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,450
for the 9p stuff was it for you you

285
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,700
absolutely need the 9p client compiled

286
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,880
into the kernel and the PC engines and I

287
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,500
haven't made I haven't seen an advantage

288
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,330
it but I have compiled in FS cache I

289
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,220
can't tell if it helped or not but you

290
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,820
do need an IP client file system alright

291
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
that's it we're doing well we're already

292
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,570
10 minutes ahead thanks everyone

293
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,620
[Applause]

294
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,680
[Music]

295
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,739
you
