2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,500
hi I'm going to talk about the state of

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,089
Lenovo notebooks running coreboot I'm

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,699
Patrick I've got a Bachelor of Science

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,460
in electrical engineering and I'm a

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,510
developer since 2015 with the focus on

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,480
Lenovo devices

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,330
this talk is privately motivated and I'm

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,840
not affiliated with companies mentioned

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,309
here and I'm not sponsored by those my

11
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,579
interest is in in Kabu tandem source

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,719
software got me the job at an element

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,180
cybersecurity where I'm currently

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,160
working as hardware and software

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,180
engineer all information gathered here

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,390
are from freedoms or software projects

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,930
and might not be accurate at all so why

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,530
Alan although Lenovo were so awesome

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,200
there a few points they have a big

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,619
community backed on them there's the

21
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,530
wide variety of platforms like they

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,140
support the Intel Core 2 Duo into

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,200
Nehalem into a hospital and have

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,860
first-class support are still actively

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,840
maintained which is kind of cool because

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,549
there's the old there are no proprietary

27
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,880
blobs to operate them so it's 100% free

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,030
software if you don't count the

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,909
microcode and until I mean and they're

30
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,549
very very cheap on the internet like on

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,930
eBay and easy to buy and have a wrecked

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,369
case which is important for me they have

33
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,439
good documentation and you can even find

34
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,799
schematics online so I'm going to talk

35
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,119
about the the past give some statistics

36
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,819
show the current state that's work in

37
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,920
progress and

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,130
look in the future so what happened over

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,130
the last few years I just walked through

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,010
the cupboard cells and collected some

41
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,140
information starting with 2015 all

42
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,940
boards got TPM 1.2 support we fixed some

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,850
issues with the shutdown and a CPI code

44
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:42,900
on the T 400 and T 500 we got the hybrid

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,380
graphics support we fixed some issues we

46
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:53,930
see audio codec and on the X 200 we got

47
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,580
pen support for the tablet mode and

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,760
fixed some panel flickering the X 60 and

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,959
T 60 got blob free graphics in it so you

50
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,220
don't need the option ROM anymore and on

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,440
the newer platforms like Sandy an Ivy

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,739
bridge we got a free remanent USB 3

53
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,590
support please express graphics in it

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,570
and IO am a new support so before that

55
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,680
they used the MRC blob provided by

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,329
Google here in 2015 it was replaced by

57
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:39,260
open source software in 2016 we got

58
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,540
support for improved support for the

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,880
image controller and fixed some issues

60
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,350
with the keyboard we started to use

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,209
shared source code for the GPIO driver

62
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,959
shared hybrid graphics driver and got

63
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,590
initial support for tool graphics up to

64
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,840
this point it was only possible to use

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,459
the integrated Intel graphics the

66
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,850
devices chip with some yellow USB port

67
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,480
that can be used to charge a phone which

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,548
is gently always on even if the device

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,520
is powered off and we got support for

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,410
lip to fix in it which

71
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,890
his graphics in it britain in ada spark

72
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,400
we fixed lots of problems with the

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,950
docking code and all the platforms you

74
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,560
need suffer to enable the docking

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,740
station we on the x200 we edit CPUC

76
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,240
states and the new platforms support for

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,530
eSATA and native remanent fixtures and

78
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,270
lots of other fixes to make the native

79
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,540
run in it more stable so there are lots

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,660
of corner cases that's properly handled

81
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,200
by the MRC bean blob but they weren't

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,410
handled by the native code we are

83
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,370
support for the postcard stage and

84
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,800
liberty of xn 8 in 2017 there are lots

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,950
of changes across all boards like

86
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,050
support for the blue produced on it can

87
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,050
now be toggled from the OS support for

88
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,310
additional with USB always-on mode

89
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,430
led control using the linux sync pad a

90
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,320
CPI column a little and fix the most

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,750
layout we have superfluous in flight we

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,530
now share the hybrid graphics driver and

93
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,540
all supported models again we rewrote

94
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,730
docking code because it's the worst

95
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,670
broken and added some support for

96
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,070
buttons and LEDs which is kind of useful

97
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,900
on docking station and important the USB

98
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,670
always-on support to more models in 2018

99
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,990
there have been some basically some some

100
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,350
code cleanup because developers tend to

101
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,630
just copy-paste an existing main board

102
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,180
port and just leave everything in that

103
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,490
might not be needed so we try to get rid

104
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,250
of that where its support for the Intel

105
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,410
vbt binary to enhance the graphics in it

106
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,270
we drop DC native graphics in it

107
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,360
because it's it does not handle all

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,900
corner cases while the new lab chief X

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,590
in it is able to support every connector

110
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,990
every mode and has a way better hardware

111
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,020
support the 8,400 side there had been

112
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,090
unified code base so we dropped all the

113
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,490
different mainboard models and put it

114
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,699
into one unified code base because they

115
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,470
all use the same mainboard reference

116
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,430
design on the new platforms we now have

117
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,380
dual graphics features enabled by

118
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,340
default we can power down it's discrete

119
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,330
GPU when only using the the internal GPU

120
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,419
which is kind of cool because it saves

121
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,139
about five watt of idle power and we

122
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,479
have support for the v1 car detection

123
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,440
and this year there's again some some

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,360
cleanups around a CPI remove headers

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,909
improved as empire's table and we

126
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,460
support more entries in DSM BIOS on

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,759
table we were finally able to set the

128
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,190
battery threshold limit using a CPI we

129
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,979
removed some unused C States and

130
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,300
hardware in it added more VB T's and

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,740
fixed some issues with the dual graphics

132
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,270
yeah that's okay and there's the

133
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,599
parallel MP in it that saves us 26

134
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,440
milliseconds boot time so as you can see

135
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,340
it takes years to fix packs and get this

136
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,120
ports on a state where compared to the

137
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,729
when defender just because everything is

138
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,570
driven by the community so some

139
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,818
statistics

140
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,980
as you can see there were a lot of

141
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,470
boards added in the last few years and

142
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,199
right now we have 31 supported Lenovo

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:58,300
boards some more statistics this or got

144
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,190
that from the sauce main board Lenovo

145
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,550
folder as you can see in the middle

146
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,970
spike here is in 2014 there were over

147
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,500
200 comments which seems to be kind of

148
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,009
cool but if you look at the next slide

149
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:17,529
we can see that in 2014

150
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,600
lots of files were added and removed

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,880
again and then again lots of files where

152
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,180
it and remove it again so they were hide

153
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,430
a very high code fluctuation yeah and as

154
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,560
you can see over the time we were adding

155
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,990
and adding more boards so it's growing

156
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,000
very slowly yeah as you can see we were

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,860
doing some some code cleanup so all the

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,170
spikes our files are being added and

159
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,970
removed again some more statistics from

160
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,029
the main bure fool once a lot of the

161
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,310
code is written or that presenter is

162
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,850
written in C we have one quarters a CPI

163
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,310
code and the remaining files are just

164
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,290
something that glues everything together

165
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,680
like device 3 huh defaults ok can't we

166
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,529
can make fast and stuff like that so

167
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,759
work in progress um we have the verified

168
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,790
boot original developed by Google on the

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,689
Chromebook

170
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:22,180
it only works on the Sandy Bridge the

171
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,750
trick here is to use the function key if

172
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,490
you hold it down at boot you can go into

173
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,470
recovery mode without opening the case

174
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,779
and work in progress we're working on

175
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,160
protecting this by flash using the

176
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,490
intervals protected region inside this

177
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,800
PI controller and we're putting the

178
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,529
verified boot to other platforms you can

179
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,870
see here the Garrett change if you're

180
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,449
interested in it

181
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,989
to do report the reboot code to other

182
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:59,429
platforms and enhance the we would

183
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,980
support in the payload

184
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,160
there's Nvidia Optimus basically it's a

185
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,499
nice epi feature but there's no

186
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:10,980
specification available Lenovo uses the

187
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,929
system management mode so it's difficult

188
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,779
to understand what's going on in the

189
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,649
formal level and I was using the novel

190
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,529
as reference and got a basic

191
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,850
implementation on the Lenovo t520 it's

192
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,160
kind of working but need tests on other

193
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,829
platforms on regular use cases and we

194
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:36,660
need to port it to other platforms

195
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,939
that's not done yet there's more

196
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:44,730
interest in code deduplication trying to

197
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,069
move everything to the device tree right

198
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:49,079
now everything is hard-coded in see

199
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,470
which kind of makes no sense we try to

200
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,420
share more code between boards that are

201
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,980
very similar and yeah so some stuff

202
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,309
already has been done this year there's

203
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,860
more to do like the MRC configuration

204
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,839
could be entirely put into device tree

205
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,679
and yeah this way more stuff like GPIO

206
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,739
configuration audio codec configuration

207
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:16,919
could be moved to device tree and yeah

208
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,549
we could even merge ports into a very

209
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:25,529
inch scheme there's the Lenovo t4 for TP

210
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:30,559
support it's in dirt right now basically

211
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,519
everything is working

212
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,429
besides the embedded controller space it

213
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,850
has some new bits that are unknown

214
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,549
undocumented and yeah what needs to be

215
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:41,819
dude

216
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,499
and the we need to find out how it's

217
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:47,429
working dual graphics we need to port

218
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:50,100
the Nvidia Optimus and improve the API

219
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,339
support on that a small comparison

220
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,339
between current code and the vendor

221
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,720
folder so we have no no blobs and Co

222
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,170
boot support end-of-life burn

223
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,770
all the vices and the optimists on

224
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,880
corporate side is very experimental we

225
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,840
boot is working but we don't have secure

226
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,250
boot while the window from Bahasa and we

227
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,110
don't support him but controller

228
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,160
firmware updates because it's completely

229
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,890
undocumented but there was a cool talk

230
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,480
on the black ideas this year so we might

231
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,900
support that too in the future possible

232
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,680
future work we got the tee 480 it has a

233
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,810
boot guard but if you got it sorry does

234
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,190
it play oh yeah so it all those devices

235
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,190
have included card if you got one that

236
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,490
does not you can change the firmware and

237
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,360
run car boot on it the Thunderbolt

238
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,460
support is still missing but system76

239
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,940
port it to their own laptop series so

240
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,730
once they upstream it we have support

241
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,040
for that too and then basically

242
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,870
everything should work as you can see

243
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,140
you just have to replace the membership

244
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,360
with coreboot running Tiano course

245
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,800
payload and then it boots up just these

246
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,130
here instead of the window from next

247
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,980
slide here we go

248
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,200
we could add support for the heating pad

249
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,710
II 495 and it's risin three Google added

250
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,040
support for the Picasso SOC for their

251
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,740
Chromebooks so it should be easy to

252
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,010
support as a 16 McFly maybe someone is

253
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,120
interested in supporting that too then

254
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,970
we have some ideas to reduce the ACP I

255
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,340
could get rid of legacy stuff nobody

256
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,950
uses anymore of its modern API wear or

257
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,520
less because it's it's easy to maintain

258
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,290
and properly

259
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,380
faster boot times there's interest in

260
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,060
supporting the firmware update demon

261
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,639
provide free cupboard bolts that's only

262
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,060
possible for car boot and blobs that

263
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,350
have compatible and license and we want

264
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,470
to use we boot and all those ports just

265
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,949
to have a secure platform that as a

266
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,380
recovery mechanism in case something

267
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,050
goes wrong and there's some more yeah we

268
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,819
need to do to improve the Windows 10

269
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:54,089
support Windows support in general it

270
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,920
needs special ACPI code this ink pad

271
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,329
daemon running on that need special a

272
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:04,019
CPI functions and video optimist and not

273
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,110
even sure if it's possible at all yeah

274
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,620
but our community main interest is in

275
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,670
Linux so we need to evaluate if that

276
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,670
Windows 10 can be improved and that's it

277
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,139
from my side do we have any questions

278
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,950
for the tea for a tea I'm just a little

279
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,960
bit confused you said you'd need a model

280
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,640
without a boot guard enabled but yes

281
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,460
come with boot guard they all chip is

282
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,290
boot cut that's true but it's not a knee

283
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,220
are not enabled on some models it it is

284
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,910
enabled by all models by default okay so

285
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,920
how can you install Corbett and you

286
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,750
can't this book are enabled you can't so

287
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,779
the device you saw in my presentation is

288
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,699
a special device that's not how do you

289
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,470
say you can buy it in a retail market

290
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,349
besides you need a special add-on or

291
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,669
something yeah ok

292
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,260
do you know if the MD notebook is

293
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,560
something like boot guard and I don't

294
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,958
know so we just have to evaluate it

295
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,130
alright then that's it I guess thank you

296
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,410
very much thank you

297
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,640
[Applause]
