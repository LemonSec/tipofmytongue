[Music]

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,019
hey thanks everyone for joining this

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:10,500
talk

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,809
my name is Nagy worked with Microsoft

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,910
cloud server influential team and part

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,379
of my job is basically to provide

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,510
manageability across all Hardware SKUs

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,080
that we are doing as far as sure so

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,369
today's talk is basically going to be

10
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,230
primarily focus on telemetry workgroup

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,840
and telemetry subsystem that we are sort

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,250
of collaborating with the community to

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,769
to enable it and so this talk is

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,450
basically divided into two parts in the

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,160
first first part I'm going to talk about

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
the problem statement that we saw and

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,270
are partially we saw and the couple of

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,280
proposals that we that we received from

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,020
community and the current alignment that

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,469
we have and kind of progress on that and

21
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,789
the second phase Kuhn is going to talk

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,710
about detail on the proposal and the

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,210
next steps that we have on this work

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,860
stream so so fundamentally right I mean

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,379
if you see the cloud the challenges

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,719
right I mean it's all workload driven

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,070
right I mean we are seeing a rapid

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,989
change in the workloads and that is

29
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,180
basically evolving us to have a new

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,040
hardware designs kind of you know on a

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,650
on a very regular face so we

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,570
traditionally we used to see only like

33
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,040
you know traditional system right one

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,610
socket

35
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,770
two socket like compute like you know

36
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,840
pizza box chassis but now if you see the

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,000
hardware has evolved rapidly right I

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,170
don't know we are we are seeing a

39
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,030
heterogeneous chasis we are you we are

40
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,220
seeing expansion boxes we are seeing a

41
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,080
whole new sort of category of hardware

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
right so so so with that with that in

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,869
place it's so difficult to kind of

44
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,939
create a consistent approach to to

45
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,350
monitor the services right

46
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,799
I mean it's so difficult with that and

47
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,329
if you see also right the commercial

48
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,460
cloud requirement requires a state of

49
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,470
our telemetry right because if you can't

50
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,540
measure it you can't improve it right so

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,180
it requires there are SLA associated

52
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,140
with the customers there are

53
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,729
availability requirements and you have

54
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:03,270
to meet that yep so so the SLA is an and

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,549
availability drives requires as your

56
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,128
telemetry from the BMC or for the system

57
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,440
right and the third third challenge or

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,970
the portion that we see is the role of

59
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,470
the BMC that has actually

60
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,020
changed from a traditional a legacy

61
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,700
microcontroller to just power on power

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,580
off to a a a very intelligent control

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
plane that is kind of serving the whole

64
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,390
sort of you know requirement like

65
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,670
deployments and no telemetry and you

66
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,590
know all the diagnostics right so the

67
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,310
role of DMC has evolved so

68
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,080
sorry technical difficulty yeah yeah no

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,590
problem

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,170
so again right I mean with that data

71
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,240
center growth with that cloud operation

72
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,220
growth what we need I mean we need we

73
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,660
have a two dimensional problem right in

74
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,070
one dimension we are trying to

75
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,050
specialize the hardware we are

76
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,000
onboarding a lot of whole set of new

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
hardware every data center but at the

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,780
same time we need to have a standard way

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,700
to manage them right because the

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,140
workloads are tailored for their

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,510
hardware but at the end that the

82
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,890
hardware still needs to be managed in

83
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,780
the same way that that it has been used

84
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,880
to right and you cannot create a custom

85
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,580
operation for two powering on a blade

86
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,260
you cannot create a custom operation to

87
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,910
deploy the firmware I mean those

88
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,709
operations the control bin operation has

89
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,840
to be same so with that in mind we know

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,660
we see it kind of you know things like

91
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,310
processes right I mean the process

92
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,440
errors are have been same so so if the

93
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,540
processor is error you need a consistent

94
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,280
method to retrieve those errors and

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,200
harvest that information and determine

96
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,970
what was the cause of the error right

97
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,920
the same with the memory right I mean

98
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,110
the you could you could you could have a

99
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,250
different kind of memory you could have

100
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,019
persistent memory you you could have non

101
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,400
positional you could have dynamic right

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,130
but but but the framework to read the

103
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,290
memory errors and harvest them and to

104
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,750
consolidate the errors and determine the

105
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,700
fru-u-- that has to be consistent across

106
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,580
all the solutions same for i/o and same

107
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,800
for OS you know Oh a subsystems wrong

108
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,510
your BMC need to kind of you know get

109
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,489
the health monitoring BMC need to get

110
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,660
the heartbeat from the operating system

111
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,250
and did remind that look a the OS is

112
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,590
healthy now this could vary from one OS

113
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,390
other OS but but the method or the

114
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,579
framework needs to consistent same for

115
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,290
power supplies and same for BMC right

116
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,730
you could have different kind of starts

117
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,770
different firmware start the different

118
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,290
form stacks that could run but we want

119
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,790
to we are interested to kind of know

120
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,650
okay how many how many requests the BMC

121
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,030
has served in the past

122
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,229
okay what's the health of the BMC

123
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,810
because I said the BMC is so critical if

124
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,400
you want to make sure the BMC is running

125
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,300
healthy so and and then you have a kind

126
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,010
of baseboard the health yeah so with

127
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,350
that like what are we trying to achieve

128
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,350
so we reviewed those problem we

129
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,280
discussed those kind of you know

130
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,750
challenges and what we thought okay

131
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,760
there's a need of a standard telemetry

132
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,070
more

133
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,550
that that we are lacking so so there are

134
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,900
there are Laura there's a lot of

135
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,520
hardware that is currently in the fluid

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,930
there's a lot of hardware that is being

137
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,670
designed but there is no standard way to

138
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,380
manage them there is no standard way to

139
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,690
kind of read the telemetry from them so

140
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,970
so what we thought was you know the so

141
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,520
we decided a work stream and we decided

142
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,320
we thought that okay we should we should

143
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,040
have a contributory telemetry from the

144
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,890
system and then once the telemetry is

145
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,870
been collected we need a standard way to

146
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,850
transport that as the transporter

147
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,340
telemetry so with that with those two

148
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,110
goals we started kind of working on this

149
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,340
problem and and we reviewed couple of

150
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,710
proposals that that came in as part of

151
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,410
the community work stream so so so a lot

152
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,940
of people said okay how do we solve this

153
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,460
problem and we saw that hey we solve

154
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,900
this problem by writing our custom

155
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,270
demonstrate I mean if you if you if you

156
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,330
have a new accelerator if you have a new

157
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,850
GPU that that we are using right now the

158
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,520
only way to harvest the telemetry from

159
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,290
that hardware is write your custom

160
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,330
domain demin and then basically in order

161
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,800
to treat the data and then use your

162
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,690
binary blobs to transport it in the

163
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,520
whatever fashion that you want it's

164
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,150
never defined right so so that that

165
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,530
doesn't kind of you know scaleless right

166
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,800
so so if we are onboarding a new

167
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,520
hardware so and and we don't have a lot

168
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,840
of information about the new harder

169
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,580
because that is propriety to that that

170
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,560
the provider so you know through

171
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,090
harvesting the data that becomes

172
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,310
challenging right so what we want to go

173
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,410
we want to basically enable hardware

174
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,570
vendors to provide their telemetry model

175
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,300
that BMC can read that's basically the

176
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,820
goal right so so with that we came

177
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,700
together and it basically started with

178
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,250
with open BMC workgroup we saw a lot of

179
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,040
interest on you know from folks you know

180
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,870
kind of okay how do I read the BMC

181
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,870
health how do I know the max platform

182
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,520
power consumption within last one week

183
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,460
or last one day right how do I know that

184
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,220
and some people said okay how do I read

185
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,260
the power supply faults that that took

186
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,840
place in last one week right so we saw

187
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,430
that okay there's an apostrophe where we

188
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,260
can we can converge and you know

189
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,810
collaborate to create a

190
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,720
and framework right so this this is what

191
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,340
kind of you know we are trending towards

192
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,740
so what we said was you know as I said

193
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,900
there are two two goals for this works

194
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,980
during the first goal was basically

195
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,650
defined a interface to collect telemetry

196
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,480
so we we sort of reviewed we export some

197
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,310
other methods and what we came down is

198
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,620
you know they could use collecti as a

199
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,560
metrical Ector so so that tool will

200
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,190
basically run inside vm c and and

201
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,290
collecti has a more than hundred plugin

202
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,120
support and so what we thought what we

203
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,070
discussed was you know the collecti

204
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,020
would run in the BMC it would interface

205
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,300
with other existing services inside BMC

206
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,450
to harvest the data and then stored it

207
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,400
as sort of you know in round-robin

208
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,910
database that database basically this

209
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,100
advantage of using collecti because

210
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,229
first of all it written in C it's very

211
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,729
highly native it's very lightweight it

212
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,350
is running in couple of other systems

213
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,479
too so it's highly stable as of now and

214
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,360
and the collecti basically produces a

215
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,520
round remote database file which are

216
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,380
highly optimized for telemetry users

217
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,630
right so so that that's the reason and

218
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,240
also is it supports natively aggregation

219
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,010
of the data so the overhead of the

220
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,520
software reduces while using this and

221
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,050
once the data is collected inside the

222
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,789
BMC how do you transport it back

223
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,010
so there's additional proposal came from

224
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,200
Parliament cell from Dell and sitting

225
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,270
out here so we discussed the red fish

226
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,130
telemetry already red fish already has a

227
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,370
telemetry model proposed and why don't

228
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,910
we leverage that so we design proposal

229
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,830
already you know on the on on there I

230
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,410
have a link please review that so

231
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,200
basically that already so it's pretty

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,860
flexible model that allows us to create

233
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,020
events it allow it basically suppose

234
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,940
pull and push models so you can you can

235
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,530
define your you can define your

236
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,890
telemetry model that okay you can define

237
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,170
requirement like okay I want to I want

238
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,720
to okay let me start this way so so

239
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
there are three subsystems in that right

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,100
one is the matron definition so so you

241
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,810
can define that okay what is my metric

242
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,089
was going to look like or you can say

243
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,240
okay I want to I want to I want to log

244
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,430
platform power consumption

245
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,850
every every to our and then I want to

246
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,350
basically once you have samples you can

247
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,060
define your calculation you see I want

248
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,339
to apply only max min and average you

249
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,589
can define your calculation algorithm as

250
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,720
part of that and and once you and then

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,580
there is a second term called the matrix

252
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,920
report definition that defines how does

253
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,080
your report look like the report could

254
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,510
look like a event I mean your metric

255
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,950
report could look like an event you want

256
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,660
to log inside the BMC's and said as a

257
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,910
cell a CL or you could use your standard

258
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,790
wreckfish model to push those to push

259
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,910
those reports so and you can also define

260
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,800
as trigger another example could be as I

261
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,170
said you know if if my Inlet temperature

262
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,550
goes beyond 40 C I want to log my CPU

263
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,500
temperature or something like that so

264
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,850
you could create a model it's pretty

265
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,779
flexible to be to be leveraged stack all

266
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:23,620
right so this is a kind of standard kind

267
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,899
of I took an example of how this how

268
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,670
this telemetry what look like as I said

269
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,529
you know so this is existing a redfish

270
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,290
prop with you know we have you know and

271
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,450
then from there you can actually you can

272
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,060
consume a property in your redfish

273
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,070
telemetry subsystem that you can consume

274
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,040
and you can produce your main Max and

275
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,430
average power consumption just an

276
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:53,529
example of that and so so let's connect

277
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,990
the dots right so I mean so you have a

278
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,700
system so the current proposed system

279
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,070
architecture is you have a collect the

280
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,920
inside BMC that is running the collector

281
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,730
he can can can communicate with other

282
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,620
open VNC demons using you know D burst

283
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,420
and then it can collect it and then it

284
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,880
can produce you know our our D files

285
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,430
inside the BMC and then you have an

286
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,560
intermittent services basically liberar

287
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,709
D that can parse those files and it can

288
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,040
produce those this data with either IPMI

289
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,990
or you can you can you can use the data

290
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,050
with redfish or you can you can directly

291
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,600
consume that data and you know kind of

292
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,000
consumed by services like graphite that

293
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,350
can consume that are

294
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,370
like pretty-pretty native right so so so

295
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,960
that's like a high level system I could

296
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,560
assure that that we are proposing and so

297
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,990
with that so the group is still active

298
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,910
it's still new I would call it we we

299
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,950
have a first proposal but that has not

300
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,140
been formalized that has not been kind

301
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,820
of checked into the master still that

302
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,670
reviews are coming in so there's a work

303
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,560
group call that we have every Tuesday

304
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,380
9:30 a.m. feel free to join that and

305
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,210
there are there's a requirement list

306
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,980
that we are capturing the requirement

307
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,900
list basically contains like what are

308
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,060
what are you trying to I mean what is

309
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,110
your current model and what are you

310
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,970
trying to achieve it basically kind of

311
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,770
and kind of getting the input to see

312
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,050
okay what direction we should go this

313
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,820
current design is based on the five or

314
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,320
six inputs that we have and we have

315
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,880
brainstorm from past like four to five

316
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,520
meetings but there still yeah I'm sure

317
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,870
they the best yet to come

318
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,240
so we will see that and this is the list

319
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,130
of design proposals that we have as of

320
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,440
now in the community that that the one

321
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,950
of them from from corn and the from the

322
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,780
from the coop also please review that

323
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,240
those designs and you know provide your

324
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,260
feedback so yeah with that I would like

325
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,870
to pass sukoon for the next stage thank

326
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,990
you

327
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,240
[Music]

328
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,300
you
