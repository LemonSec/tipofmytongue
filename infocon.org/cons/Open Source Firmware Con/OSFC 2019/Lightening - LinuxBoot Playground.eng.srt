00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:10,050
hi guys my name is Ravi Shah and I'm an

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,300
intern at Google and my hosts are Ron

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,460
and gone and we're gonna be presenting

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,079
web boot a little about me

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,850
I'm from DePaul University back in

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,619
Chicago I'm doing a bachelor's in

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,630
computer science and I'm going into my

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,640
third year and then this is my padme

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,480
Lewis hello my name is Lewis and I

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,449
worked together with Alicia as intended

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,750
Google I'm a rising junior at Dartmouth

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,140
College so a little about web boot so

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,700
imagine you have a laptop without an

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,469
operating system what would you like to

16
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,480
run today you can run any operating

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,489
system that's on stored on web you want

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,500
to run Chrome OS all you have to do is

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,629
type web ooh Chrome OS if you want to

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,120
run tiny core you can run web boot tiny

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,469
core the choice is yours

22
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,960
what repre provides is it's like never

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,329
seen before you don't need the typical

24
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,070
materials that you would need before

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,610
like a bootable USB stick a CD a DVD or

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,560
a hard drive well what boot does it

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,479
stores everything in RAM and lets you

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,220
boot any operating system you would like

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,310
to so web boot is an open source tool

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,619
and just like most of the things here

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,140
it's open source and it's used to boot

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,659
operating live operating systems from

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,900
the web so it downloads and loads a new

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,090
operating system web would grow out of

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,070
nav and Neph is the project that my team

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,079
at Google is working on and we

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,890
implemented web boot in go long web boot

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,560
is exceptionally fast compared to other

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,140
methods of booting and we actually timed

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,210
it and it took about 22 seconds to

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,399
compile the user length and to create

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,159
the inner term FS since we're boot is

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,729
open-source

44
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,680
that's the link to our report and if you

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,740
guys want to contribute to a project we

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,140
really appreciate that so before we're

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,729
both what were the typical steps of

48
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,040
booting into an operating system so

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,960
first of all the classic way you had to

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,179
buy a USB right then you had to download

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,280
an operating system then after

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,870
downloading an operating system you had

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,530
to create a

54
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,960
of which this is sort of like complex to

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,660
some other people who are not in tech

56
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,000
after that you had to find the a new

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,590
laptop just sort of like boot the

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,380
operating system on and you had to

59
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,570
change the bias to sort of like boot

60
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,510
from the USB then after that you had to

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,610
boot into the new operating system and

62
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,770
in this process you you care to

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,740
potentially risk wiping out your hard

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,810
disk it happened to some people

65
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,870
then with Web words what you have to do

66
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,209
you just type where boot and you type

67
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,520
the RS so let's say you want to put tiny

68
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,800
core you can just do web board then

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,050
Tenneco if you want to put open to you

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,230
just do web put then open to it if you

71
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,970
look on google search and you type out a

72
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,959
flash a USB there's 66 million searches

73
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,330
66 million searches to one web boot tiny

74
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,070
core web boot any OS so why this show is

75
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,300
web boot shows that you can use

76
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,370
persistent memory devices to boot

77
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,410
any operating system you like so what

78
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,330
this does it stores the operating system

79
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,790
in RAM and what it does is goes to the

80
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,590
next and then the next kernel would be

81
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,090
able to look at the memory that's stored

82
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,370
and be able to take and extract anything

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,019
that they would like like packages

84
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,030
graphics all of the things that the

85
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,489
operating system has it can look at it

86
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,799
and it can use it it's a new way of

87
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,440
booting an OS and it also provides the

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,299
user flexibilities one of the things

89
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,480
that my my host told me about when I

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,660
first joined this team was that two

91
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,360
examples imagine if your journalist back

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,489
in a country that doesn't have that much

93
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,079
privacy and you're writing a journal

94
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,640
ordered article and a police comes

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,920
knocking on your door you can't as of

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,450
right now when you close your laptop

97
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,549
things are stored in your hard drive you

98
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,320
can't just wipe them out with web boot

99
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,690
you can have everything you can shut off

100
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,000
your laptop everything is gone so the

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,530
police wouldn't be able to have access

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,630
to it software engineers we like

103
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,340
debugging things what if you want to go

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,870
into Chrome OS one day and just kind of

105
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,030
you know kind of go in and look at it

106
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,250
and debug things and then leave well

107
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,900
with reppu you can do that you can get

108
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,029
into any user land you want and be able

109
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,580
to do any of those things so we have a

110
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,400
little demo and we'll show you that

111
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,620
so right now it's booting into Europe

112
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,580
which is like where we start from then

113
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,320
somebody's gonna type where but then

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,590
TinyCo which is the version of the Linux

115
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,720
we want to boot then the boss to sort of

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,300
like print out any messages that come

117
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,540
out so my job in this was setting up the

118
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,910
networking so what I did was I kind of

119
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,070
worked with th client and I worked with

120
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,930
downloading the entire ISO from the web

121
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,510
so as of right now uh or Wi-Fi is

122
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,669
perfect it can connect to any Wi-Fi

123
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,620
network that has password or in either

124
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,260
nut code my D H Kline kind of looks for

125
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,010
ipv4 and ipv6 this there was an existing

126
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,949
D H client but we implemented it as long

127
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,660
as it connected to one of them we were

128
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,729
able to download and load any other

129
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:26,389
operands and download the OS from the

130
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:28,550
web so it's configuring it it's getting

131
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,650
the message the th client is getting the

132
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,690
message from the server and after this

133
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,110
it's gonna start downloading the file

134
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,249
[Music]

135
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,150
files like downloading the file then

136
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,950
after that e to Kazik into the TinyCo

137
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,950
almost

138
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,000
yeah so downloading the files way was

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,940
kinda like a little bit slow but there

140
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,950
we go

141
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,580
so at the top corner you can see it's

142
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,950
sort of like loading extensions it's

143
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,600
sort of like reads from that persistent

144
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,910
memory device we sort of like Roger Elia

145
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,870
and after loading extensions it's it

146
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,820
puts into technical and it shows all the

147
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,470
things that the tiny core has you can

148
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,000
have a terminal it has everything that

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,230
tiny core normally has

150
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,800
so that's good so like I talked before

151
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,710
mine was Wi-Fi and eh client so what I

152
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,469
did was we had networking stuff that we

153
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,060
had to deal with so my job was to

154
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,490
connect to one of the interfaces whether

155
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,039
that was Wi-Fi or Ethernet and then get

156
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,159
a message back from the server and

157
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,539
connecting that after that I started

158
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,819
downloading the the ISO from the

159
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,889
internet onto a persistent memory device

160
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,810
storing it all in persistent memory

161
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,529
device then after she stood the files in

162
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:16,689
the persistent memory device I had to

163
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,610
sort of like mount that device on a file

164
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,770
so that I could access the kennel and

165
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,529
the inner term FS files then after

166
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:24,939
accessing those files

167
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,219
I sort of like had another function

168
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:29,409
which sort of like processed the command

169
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,599
line so different operating system

170
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,520
require like different command line

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,830
parameters so we had to process the

172
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,580
command line with respect to the

173
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,379
operating system we wanted to boot so

174
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,819
you can either pass the command line

175
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,729
parameters as a flag or we can

176
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,589
automatically put them when we write

177
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,779
them inside the command then after doing

178
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:53,069
that I wrote the function to Kazak it's

179
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,529
checking into the new operating system

180
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,270
and it that's what loaded the new

181
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,689
operating system so some of the

182
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,550
challenges that we face the personal

183
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,199
challenge was not having a lot of

184
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,610
documentation on persistent memory

185
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,889
everything that we looked up on Google

186
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,659
search or anywhere dealt with persistent

187
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,669
memory devices with Dax we didn't use

188
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,169
Dax we just use persistent memory

189
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,990
devices another thing is security so

190
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,529
right now our our web boot we have an

191
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,330
internal map and we have a link to tiny

192
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,699
core we would have a link to Boone - or

193
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,589
any of those things but web food is

194
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,599
supposed to provide users flexibility of

195
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,159
downloading anything they want whether

196
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,890
that's a boon to version 1 version 1.1

197
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,320
whatever but that comes with a lot of

198
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,208
security questions what if a hacker

199
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,099
creates a new website that looks just

200
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,409
like a boon - has everything that a boon

201
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,690
- has and then wants web boot to run

202
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,420
that opera operating system well that

203
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,000
can be viruses virus prune and all of

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,100
those things so we really need help with

205
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,699
security

206
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,860
another thing is pmm drivers are not

207
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,350
enabled in most linux kernel's so when

208
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,089
we boot

209
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,649
- they don't have pmm drivers in their

210
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,869
Colonels configurations loaded so it's

211
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,429
like what came first the chicken or the

212
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:02,909
egg

213
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,739
the first kernel has persistent memory

214
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:06,749
in the side for the next kernel to look

215
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:08,489
at but the next Curlin doesn't know how

216
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,169
to deal with that so that's another

217
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:14,999
issue that we're running into so the

218
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,979
future work on our project is to boot

219
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:22,049
more distros right now we can only boot

220
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,419
tiny core and to boot Anika we had to

221
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:27,599
use our Kino and enable the persistent

222
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,179
memory and recompile the kennel to

223
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,199
mirror that of tiny comb but for this

224
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,999
show such as Ubuntu they're big and it's

225
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,799
really hard to sort of like recompile

226
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,779
their kennels so we want to boot Ubuntu

227
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,209
Linux Debian and Chrome OS and some

228
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,729
other operating systems and she talked

229
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,649
about security is another issue we want

230
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:49,139
to deal with and lastly we wanted to

231
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,359
sort of like install it in Co boot right

232
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,049
now we are using a USB where we put from

233
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,089
but in the future we want to actually

234
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,649
install it in the hard way and then we

235
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,539
just want to say special things to our

236
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,349
team

237
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:09,109
Ron gone Brian Prachi and Chris

238
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:19,230
any questions yeah please sir queue up

239
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:30,689
at the microphones again I tried to

240
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,040
build it and it didn't work can you

241
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:46,829
can't help me you actually bought it you

242
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,719
need to buy a support plan for that I

243
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,949
think we can look into that after the

244
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:59,689
presentation I hope you get it to work I

245
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,879
have a question how do you download do

246
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:10,680
you use HTTP right now I don't think we

247
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,589
are using HTTP but we plan on using

248
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,600
HTTPS because it's secure this was just

249
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,120
a proof of concept in a way and we hope

250
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,559
to develop it more and use HTTPS okay

251
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,990
yeah there there is a project called net

252
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,329
boot XY said or if you're not familiar

253
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:30,420
with it it has check sums and things

254
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,309
like that that do not require you to use

255
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,920
HTTPS if you and it also has a bunch of

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,529
like yeah the latest Ubuntu releases and

257
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:38,850
they've been releases and things like

258
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,189
that might be useful to corroborate

259
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,199
matter okay thank you

260
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,300
I'll look for you after the president

261
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,689
you sitting here yeah thank you

262
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,689
Thanks

263
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:01,670
how long did this take so our internship

264
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,300
was 12 weeks so the first half of early

265
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,920
internship for six weeks we kind of did

266
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,750
a lot of research kind of did it

267
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,910
manually and we looked until like

268
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,620
persistent memory device because when we

269
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,790
were doing this project we didn't know

270
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,890
how to work with it first thing was we

271
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,390
can just pack it all in the inner rim of

272
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,190
us and kind of load it but then the

273
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,529
inner rim of us would become too big so

274
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,899
then we kind of came up and did the

275
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,450
persistent memory way and it worked

276
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,130
so we kind of went along with that so

277
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,110
the last six weeks we kind of really

278
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:36,470
tailored towards web boot all right I'm

279
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,450
gonna mention they began the summer

280
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,600
never having seen go they new Java never

281
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,070
having built a kernel and didn't know

282
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,810
what an init Ram FS was didn't know what

283
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,350
DHCP was in fact every single thing you

284
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,940
see up here is stuff they had to learn

285
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,829
from scratch which is why I was so

286
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,160
impressed with this project thank you

287
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:04,410
[Applause]

288
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,209
[Music]

289
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,268
you
