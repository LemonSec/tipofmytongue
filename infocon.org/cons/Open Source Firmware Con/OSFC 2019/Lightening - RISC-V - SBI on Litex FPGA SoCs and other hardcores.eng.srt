00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,259
[Music]

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,340
hey just a quick disclaimer I didn't

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,089
write a lot of this firmware software

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,960
that I'm gonna demonstrate it's quick

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,470
thank you to all these people here so hi

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,990
my name's teshon I'm based in Brisbane

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,949
and this is Queensland and we're all the

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,630
way over here in the USA in tendrán

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,120
TISCO so very long flight to get here

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,280
yeah that's always saying long flight

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,210
I'm gonna be talking about RT and

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,910
firmware being firmware one of the other

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,160
attendees also came from Australia and

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,379
they saw that on their entertainment

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,399
screen my day job I work at open gear

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,000
using open source firmware we do smart

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,030
out of Bend console servers which also

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,379
do fail over to sell yeah so as I was

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,459
saying before I'm not gonna be talking

20
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,260
about Marty but Adi Adi is a FPGA

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,299
development board easy way to remember

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,710
Marty without the M and the mainly

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,530
reason it you would use an FPGA maybe

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,780
for most people here designing building

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,549
a marker controller out or an FPGA so

26
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,200
you don't have to do a lot of this stuff

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,900
in hardware and for those of you who

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,570
don't know what an FPGA is field

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,720
programmable gate array now what's a

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,390
gate put in two inputs and can output

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,200
NAND gate nor gate go a bit further on

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,110
from that FPGAs are built up with these

33
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,130
things called Lots so in a nice forty

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,979
you would have a lot like this put four

35
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,500
inputs get an output get enough of these

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,329
and you can build up a microcontroller

37
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,049
CPU anything in hardware that's about as

38
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,030
much depth so I'm going to go into on

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,979
FPGAs why do you want to use an FPGA

40
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,310
some common examples arcade emulation or

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,500
computers from 30 35 years ago

42
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,260
the one on the left is mini-me mr. bored

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,959
spice by most people in a couple of

44
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,510
talks before we're talking about this so

45
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,900
you would use it for a spy spy was

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,489
developed for a time of check time of

47
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,829
yeast attacks you can also use it for

48
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,889
monitoring your spy bus or as a

49
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,780
replacement open-source version of a

50
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,930
dead frog any other reasons you might

51
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,569
use a FPGA you have some other niche

52
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,150
thing that you need really fast

53
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,500
turnaround low volumes common example

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,969
that is used in open source conferences

55
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,370
in Australia particularly Python and

56
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,030
learner's comp there was a guy called

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,849
Tim that created the HDMI to USB device

58
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,889
so custom hardware you can get the

59
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,230
Gerber's everything on github for both

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,139
these boards the one on the left is a

61
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:20,829
new motto

62
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:24,790
oopss and the one on the right is any TV

63
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,449
v2 connects of a PCI but essentially for

64
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,040
conferences like this people give

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,629
presentations hook up their own laptops

66
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,599
and you want to capture it stream it to

67
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,769
YouTube etc anyway going back to the

68
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,859
HDMI to USB after three years of

69
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:53,949
designing it they use the the vendor

70
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,970
tools and stuff from Xilinx mainly and a

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,859
lot of this stuff was very slow to get

72
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:02,979
working so they could capture stuff over

73
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,859
USB nothing over Ethernet buffering

74
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,599
didn't work the license it was

75
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,379
complicated Tim being Tim thought okay

76
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,159
let's use part in everything when it

77
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,978
comes to Tim Ansel he loves patent so

78
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,620
latex is

79
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,510
a fork of margin so instead of writing

80
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,410
you know generic fare log or VHDL you

81
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,840
can write Python to put together your

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,070
blocks but you still need some hardware

83
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,260
understanding it's good if you have a

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,500
electronics engineering background or

85
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,540
have done digital design before so with

86
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,570
my genu it's a hardware description

87
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,430
language you can use it to design a full

88
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,080
system-on-chip add-in soft CPU or other

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,180
peripherals so with latex it currently

90
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,970
supports a bunch of soft CPUs some of

91
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,110
the lesser-known ones

92
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,380
let us micro open race I've heard some

93
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,940
other people at the conference talking

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,430
about this there are currently three

95
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,410
risk five CPUs supported and somebody's

96
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:31,289
working on power line still it still

97
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,470
doesn't sound like enough to use latex

98
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,710
debugging hardware has had so one other

99
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,389
reason why you might use latex instead

100
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,639
of another vendor platform is to

101
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,500
increase inspect bit early inside the

102
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,229
FPGA so instead of having a soft CPU

103
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,139
inside the FPGA you can add a bridge in

104
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,370
Latics and just work on your a

105
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,099
peripheral and everything else there ROM

106
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,830
DDR flash that's on the board and

107
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,229
instead of instead of debugging it on

108
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,630
the device you can use the bridge to

109
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:21,110
debug over USB over Ethernet

110
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,430
so Tim created this thing called latex

111
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,310
built environment it's a Python

112
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,409
environment sets up all the cross

113
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,909
compilers firmware building board

114
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,330
programming etc that's the URL you can

115
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,370
find it at and anyway moving on to risk

116
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,120
five so a lot of people have been

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,030
talking about described at this

118
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:54,169
conference there's a 32 64 128 bit

119
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,759
versions of risk 5 there's some

120
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,219
extensions for a floating-point bit

121
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:03,430
manipulation etc a couple of people

122
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,610
using it the main guys will probably be

123
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,919
sci-fi some people from Western Digital

124
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,479
and some other companies here some other

125
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,430
countries are using it because of trade

126
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,620
war Kampala and operating support it's

127
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,719
good and it by using risk 5 you can

128
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,610
concentrate on your niche so the

129
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,379
synopsis I gave originally for this was

130
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,909
about the SBIR is 5 there's a bit a

131
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,370
bunch of functions and experimental and

132
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,089
vendor extensions so instead of having a

133
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:41,690
UART

134
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,560
you would run your console through the

135
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,779
SBI and then you can redirect it like

136
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:52,310
you would ever BMC so they give a quick

137
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,000
demo on Nick's on Latics

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,430
currently we have it on a vex risk 5

139
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,800
soft core it works in by secure and

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,400
hardware some peripherals need to be

141
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,909
worked on a little bit more and the MMU

142
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,650
list version currently doesn't work

143
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,240
so inside linux spy flash doesn't work

144
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,800
we're using it inside the bootloader

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,370
GPIO doesn't work inside Linux and DMA

146
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,449
doesn't work inside Linux so this is a

147
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,610
quick demo of me running lifetime

148
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,940
it boots from spy trains memory grabs

149
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,969
the root of s in kernel from flash boots

150
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:56,720
up risks 35 32 bit processor 128 Meg's

151
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,470
of RAM so moving on to some other

152
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,470
distractions related to these this poopy

153
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,950
so creepy is Python describing the

154
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,700
hardware running microwatt in you can go

155
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,990
to that URL if you're interested in that

156
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,279
a bit more so fo and follow me if you're

157
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,540
interested in receive and you want to

158
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,190
play with but you don't spend the money

159
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,170
to run know full Linux system this is a

160
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,019
open-source hardware project that you

161
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,790
can buy for about forty five US dollars

162
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,709
if you want the production version i've

163
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,329
got some hacker boards if anybody's

164
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,790
interested come and see me and I can

165
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,720
give you a board yeah yeah either of us

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,399
any anybody else wanna raise their hand

167
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,730
if they're giving them out no in the

168
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,540
corner there as well

169
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,110
okay icebreaker is another fpga board

170
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,760
why would use an fpga this is hooked up

171
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,029
to an LED panel playing rickroll you buy

172
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,360
this for about seventy bucks and the UL

173
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,329
x3s designed by some guy guys in poland

174
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,870
this is a lattice ec p5 this is what I

175
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,940
used to run spy spy for the time of

176
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,610
check time of these attacks depending on

177
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,060
how many gates you need you can buy the

178
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,579
cheaper version I think is but twenty

179
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:29,959
five thousand gates for about sixty

180
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,579
dollars and eighty-five thousand gate

181
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,779
version for about two hundred and

182
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,560
someone else in Australia is also

183
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,220
working another ECP p5 board this is a

184
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,610
where the form-factor similar to our

185
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,089
sizing that to an Arduino not currently

186
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,490
available but we might get further on

187
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,670
that and if you're interested in risk 5

188
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,339
there's a competition closing next week

189
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,800
or the week after next wind up to 5,000

190
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,379
euros a high-five unleashed board and an

191
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,240
expansion board if you can do that

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,990
google it if you want more information

193
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,399
and if anybody's interested in this come

194
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,040
see me at hackathon or shoot me an email

195
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,310
you can find me on any of the socials

196
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,839
that few Taurus and other than that you

197
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,579
should be able to find me

198
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:30,920
Linux Kampf in Australia in the cold

199
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,490
coast it's pretty much just down the

200
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,529
road from where I live there might be a

201
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,470
Tim videos hackfest the week before if

202
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:46,279
you decide to come early right so if you

203
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,110
have questions please queue up at the

204
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,620
likes again

205
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,419
all righty I was in a meeting and I

206
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,209
missed this talk most of it I apologize

207
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,909
but what of the boards you showed I

208
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,619
might have missed them or irony that do

209
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:19,649
rrv 64 so if you buy a Noddy

210
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,029
that's a hundred T okay you can run the

211
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,359
rocket okay but I think that's probably

212
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:31,619
about $200 and the other one the UL

213
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:35,429
likes you Alex

214
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,919
you will 3x go back a couple slides the

215
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,229
Heian version of that you probably can

216
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,349
run it this one also has a completely

217
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,789
open-source bitstream synthesizer oh

218
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,019
nice

219
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,609
these guys have a reverse engineered it

220
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:56,759
and Adi may have something by the end of

221
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,599
the year okay but currently using the

222
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:10,649
vendor tools thanks very much yeah Linux

223
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:13,589
comp is a 13-2 generator 17th of Jenner

224
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,449
if anybody wants to come to Australia

225
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,030
alright then thank you very much
