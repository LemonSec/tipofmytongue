2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,560
welcome back everyone

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,519
so our next speakers Jean Marie and Erin

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,280
are going to talk about scotch tape and

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,760
flash ROM and the way of the UEFI and

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,039
enjoy the talk big round of applause

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,070
please

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,300
so good afternoon everybody

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,519
as you can hear I'm French or how many

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,360
French people in the room at least two

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,930
people might be able to understand me so

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,860
sorry for the accent so I'm working for

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,160
a camp could i cheering you and I was I

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,079
was leading a Rison competing but we

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,390
have been acquired back in June

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,789
our job is to design open hardware

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,969
servers and we we are we selling we

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,829
certified hardware and new hardware we

19
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,050
are trying to expand the life cycle on

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,539
some of the machines and we are deeply

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,730
involved into the Linux boot projects

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,099
because we we wants to get rid of the mi

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,540
system bios which are edging on this so

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,790
Dan talk is not about Who I am but it's

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,090
more about and I'm sharing with our own

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,250
since a cover of Muncie so we met I

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,830
think in six months ago or three months

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,259
ago just before summer so we are back to

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,900
schools and it wasn't much most expenses

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,439
ago and our own ISM is new to system

31
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,880
BIOS development and discover the joy of

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,030
of running testing with lower level

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,210
firmware development and the story about

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,759
the scotch tape is more what kind of

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,220
hint we could provide to our on how to

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,799
upgrade the firmware on a winterfell OCP

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,110
server and what you should know is that

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,790
even if this is an open hardware machine

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,530
there is no spy heater on this machine

40
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,450
so it has to remove the flash chip from

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,670
the from the socket and find a way to

42
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,649
remove it in an easy way without him

43
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,710
having any tools so we told him just use

44
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,590
some scotch tape and and and unglue the

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,810
chip and replace it replace it by using

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,580
the scotch tape from the single fingers

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,770
so this is this is just the

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,980
Bank idea of how that stuff works so

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,100
when our room came to me and asking me I

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,830
want to develop a new a new way to test

51
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,650
the security of system by us and this is

52
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,450
what his company is currently doing so

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,250
he's working for a start-up and it will

54
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,130
deeply it will explain you just let

55
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,580
around what he is doing it has before a

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,820
development platform and and he joined

57
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,640
the Linux boot community while trance

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,300
it's either I think four months years

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,790
ago and we stand in my development

60
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,830
platform which is the window film

61
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,970
machine that you can see on the right

62
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,090
hand side and it needed a cover of tools

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,580
from flash roms to deadly programmer

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,010
debug custom cars power supplies oil

65
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,070
communications the nodes and

66
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,870
understanding how that stuff works so

67
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,840
when you came from software that's a lot

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
of things and there is another issue

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,100
when you work for a start-up which is

70
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,890
you mostly work from home and that stuff

71
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,140
is not really women compliant especially

72
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,209
when you are married and you separated

73
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,800
with a French woman that's that's even

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,390
tougher and this is the case of our room

75
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,540
so by the way so I understand the pain

76
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,330
that he faced during summer with that

77
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,850
development board so and we started to

78
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,709
work together to find a fight some

79
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,140
options to enhance the development

80
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,780
platform and find a way to atooma ties

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,840
the testing and that's a part of the

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,490
Linux boot CI that I'm going to

83
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,560
introduce tomorrow afternoon so during a

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,500
longer talk so I'm just introducing the

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,040
rough idea that we had around this this

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,830
platform so the the main goal of Arun is

87
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,640
to to stay statsky on security of Linux

88
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,450
of system BIOS images at scale so it

89
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,550
means that he's looking and seeking for

90
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,250
as many system BIOS image that he could

91
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,800
get from end users and try to identify

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,100
any malware variables or any everything

93
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,858
which could go wrong with this image so

94
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,209
when you think about it there is

95
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,130
millions of system in the flew on and

96
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,500
how can we test that at scale so we

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,419
probably cannot test that with this kind

98
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,820
of technology and and we started to work

99
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,420
together

100
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,450
finding a way to have something which

101
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,980
could scow so we we developed from the

102
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,510
winter for a cloud-based of so saying

103
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,180
that instead of having the servers

104
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,950
within your bedroom or your living room

105
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,310
so and and replacing the BIOS chips we

106
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,650
should find a way to SSH to a platforms

107
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,410
and using an API and submit a firmware

108
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,870
image start the Machine and get feedback

109
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,540
on the status of basic testings like

110
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,400
does the does the machine has been able

111
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,830
to boot is it able to boot and operating

112
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,340
systems and can we identify any specific

113
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,280
issues from the from the behavior of the

114
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,450
platform so we we don't need anymore to

115
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,090
swab the chip so we are using some

116
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,790
flashy minerals and various ways to

117
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,250
manage that we develop a Web API and

118
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,260
Arun is now able with this team to get

119
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,170
connection directly to servers in data

120
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,870
centers and testing firmware as as much

121
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,600
as he wants and and roughly we are

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,250
working with the Linux boot team right

123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,140
now to integrate that stuff with our

124
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,930
github account and getting a continuous

125
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,690
integration platform which from every

126
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,720
commits we can check if the firmware

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,950
generated is able to boot the Machine

128
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,550
and if if it's a if the new features is

129
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,690
working properly or not

130
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,670
on live Hardware so that's that's the

131
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,630
main goal so Aaron tool is called the

132
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,840
Almo analyzers and as I said this is

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,120
correcting image and you can go on

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,490
prototypes on these websites which is

135
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,700
how more that a ice slash can so you can

136
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,100
upload film well there and get

137
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,600
straightforward backs on your firmware

138
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,920
integrity and and get in there Isis just

139
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,130
to give you the the a view of the winter

140
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,500
fund that with virtualized to remove the

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,080
scotch tape so we we got the spy flash

142
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,720
you know so there is a hardware hack for

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,320
that so we we had to remove the S or the

144
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,140
the chip a heater from the motherboard

145
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,540
so we remove that with adrenalin so

146
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,090
that's a it's not the dungeon was hacked

147
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,920
but that's a tricky things to do

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,840
kill the motherboard if you you should

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,390
do it the wrong way but and then we sort

150
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,050
that down

151
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,750
something heaters and we get we get the

152
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,940
emulators and and through the API

153
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,590
currently you can stop the emulator

154
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,990
started and upload a new film where an

155
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,780
image and run and run the software and

156
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,510
you can put on and off the the servers

157
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,090
so just in case your firmware is

158
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,220
breaking the nerd so which could happen

159
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,830
and roughly it's happening more more

160
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,890
often than it is working yeah that's

161
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,920
that's the thing and and we are

162
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,650
currently using that that approach for

163
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,050
both project either on Linux boot or our

164
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,210
own projects on that's the that's the

165
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,280
other thing just to show you it's not a

166
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,350
demo but ok my internet connection died

167
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,500
that's that's a demo so I was connected

168
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,020
to the servers and get get access to the

169
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,300
firmware but instead so I hope it will

170
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,450
work tomorrow afternoon the thing is

171
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,580
with that technology you can be

172
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,990
everywhere on the world you get access

173
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,940
to data centers and you get you can get

174
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,850
access to the firmware level ok shut up

175
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,450
John yeah we will do that little bit

176
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,170
later so Aaron now is going to introduce

177
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,860
you his own work on how I can use that

178
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,380
technology to enhance each security

179
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,980
stack and scan it at some testing

180
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,100
hundred of firmware instead of one by

181
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,840
one sure so yeah I got involved around

182
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,480
six months ago with with the project our

183
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,510
aim was to primarily my background as an

184
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,390
endpoint security so basically malware

185
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,780
anti-malware so things like chromium and

186
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,880
that's my world the world from where I

187
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,789
came from firmware has started to become

188
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,659
an increasingly important idea to the

189
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,570
point where a lot of the endpoint

190
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,000
security research is now shifting its

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,980
attention towards you know tackling

192
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,260
things like the BIOS so just going back

193
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,050
up as a few slides

194
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,480
the miscellaneous toolsets that a

195
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,090
reference there is of import so

196
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,220
currently if you want to do serious

197
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,210
analysis you'll have to kind of find

198
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,230
your own way to unpack I said wrong or

199
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,360
you might have to source it from you

200
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,580
know different types of websites and

201
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,100
places where sometimes you have

202
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,839
encountered manufacturer websites where

203
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,510
it's just like an open blob where

204
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,420
there's not a proper reference of where

205
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,240
the original is coming from or whether

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,100
comparative firmware can be analyzed

207
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,290
either so it's a bit of a wild west at

208
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,910
the moment our focus is trying to

209
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,339
develop a system which can accept a any

210
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,589
firmware so we started out with

211
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,540
euphy roms and things like that but now

212
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,660
we have people sending us router

213
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,370
firmware a new segment is video firmware

214
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,000
bunches of things like that so with John

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,950
Murray's system the advantage there is

216
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,870
that you can start the instrument

217
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,600
dynamic analysis as well aside from the

218
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,660
normal static stuff which you know we do

219
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,980
so I am bit bummed that he was not able

220
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,360
to show that off because that would be

221
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,690
really interesting and one of the cool

222
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,730
things that we did was to also take a

223
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,700
look at what's the advantage of running

224
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,070
Linux boot versus say a stock ami that

225
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,760
came on the Winterfell so we used the

226
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,589
standard in that which is chips again

227
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,560
today morning I heard that the boot time

228
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,660
differences and it it appears that even

229
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,600
for testing from a security point of

230
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
view Linux boot does a bit better and

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
this is with no particular enhancements

232
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,490
so these are like comments directly from

233
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,580
Tramel and Ron with regards to that

234
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:59,570
effort so with that what happens is we

235
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,959
started to develop a small system where

236
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,400
we could accept a ROM BIOS image and

237
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,010
unpacked or all of the constituent

238
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,680
portable executables so we have all

239
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,810
these manufacturers that we have now had

240
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,690
a database on and I think this is off by

241
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,450
probably 30 to 40 in the past 40 hours

242
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,590
and we since we come from the

243
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,580
anti-malware space we have you know sets

244
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,830
set of static rules that can trigger on

245
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,760
all these exe s so it's been a bit fun

246
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,150
because we are seeing a lot of smoke and

247
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,060
it is a bit scary and this is just using

248
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,300
static analyzers and the real aim is to

249
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,850
go to the point where we would be able

250
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,910
to work with Joe Murray system where we

251
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,580
could started dynamically instrument if

252
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,650
he's in execution and all do you want to

253
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:03,140
speak a bit about that yeah no no for

254
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,700
your part we're using your

255
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,570
infrastructure you could actually see

256
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,210
things in execution as well yeah that's

257
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,980
that's the thing so when when we are

258
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,750
running on live hardware you can do

259
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,430
whatever you want so you can instrument

260
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,500
the firmware and you can get feedback

261
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,220
directly and we we must Lee use that

262
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,980
infrastructure that's because at the

263
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,810
early stage of the Linux boot project we

264
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,040
faced issues to boot up values Linux

265
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,500
distro so there was some kind of

266
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,150
tweaking which were required and

267
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,270
installer we are not working properly on

268
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,640
the Linux with machines and we we

269
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,030
decided to integrate a full CI and

270
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,360
rebuild read Adsense OS and hold the

271
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,130
distro to check if they could be working

272
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,960
on Linux boot or not straight straight

273
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,410
out of the box and when we looked at the

274
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,510
combination with that's going to be a

275
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,550
nightmare if we try to do it by hand and

276
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,310
we need we need we needed to scale so we

277
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,870
are able to roughly we're able to

278
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,150
emulate any kind of production

279
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,710
environment with document

280
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,670
infrastructures yeah so we we got right

281
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,800
now the back end is about 100 servers so

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,950
on only 20 are usable for the firmware

283
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,440
analyzes but 80 of them

284
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,520
a usable for stretching the machine

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,950
which are under testing so the

286
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,960
implications for us is we have done a

287
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,930
bunch of work where we've used normal

288
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,630
static techniques and we started to find

289
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,930
some really crazy stuff so this happened

290
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,590
in the past two weeks the last two parts

291
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,570
the first ones we've been starting for a

292
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,250
while so there was a well-documented

293
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,250
case of a rootkit on a Lenovo in 2015

294
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,550
and what we have found since then is

295
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,600
we've almost identified four that

296
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,820
happened on top of what they you know

297
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,240
what they got caught and so that's a bit

298
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,560
concerning the more funny thing is when

299
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,870
you look at even modern systems like

300
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,720
these two submissions came from one was

301
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,580
from the US the other one was from Italy

302
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,070
both of them are fairly recent systems

303
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,850
one is a alien via machine that's 2017

304
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,400
is a high end system and a razor which

305
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,080
is also a kind of a high end gaming

306
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,090
system I don't own any of these machines

307
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,560
these are people submitting their roms

308
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,430
for analysis

309
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,150
both of these machines we would find

310
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,520
this is an actual cert that is in the

311
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,350
production form where of this machine

312
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,270
with caps lock do not trust my test BK I

313
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,970
kid you not see so I think you get the

314
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,040
picture and so we're not you know using

315
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,370
any kind of very sophisticated things at

316
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,750
this point even with that this is the

317
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,340
situation so it is a bit scary

318
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,570
and going back to those stats I can only

319
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,150
speak things in aggregate because as our

320
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,180
customers have stepped up we we have

321
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,710
been advised that we can't talk about

322
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,330
certain things so it on an aggregate we

323
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,839
have almost you know gotten near about

324
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,850
200,000 DX's there are of particular

325
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,800
interest now these are not necessarily

326
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,680
malicious they might be even some things

327
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,500
which are not you know following proper

328
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,660
security hygiene or they're just doing

329
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,649
something that wasn't

330
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:40,589
you know part of the spec and so it's

331
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,360
really interesting for us is that this

332
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,529
is just static

333
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,869
it's not even dynamic instrumentation at

334
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:48,839
this point and to see this picture is

335
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:58,019
pretty scary then we come to the non bio

336
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,079
so you see for my submissions that is

337
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,819
particularly entertaining because some

338
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,339
of them contain entire Linux

339
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,509
distributions default passwords buggy

340
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,990
web apps and things like that we started

341
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,529
to have more and more submissions that

342
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:21,300
are not really BIOS or UC and we now

343
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,629
have been engaged to start developing a

344
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,610
methodology by which we could you know

345
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,649
tackle things like you know supply chain

346
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,059
compromise you also started to take a

347
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,149
get a lot of video roms none of these

348
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,860
things are having particularly high

349
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,569
level of scrutiny at this point in time

350
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:44,970
where it is a bit interesting for myself

351
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,819
because my world was restricted to Tops

352
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:50,670
ring minus one till six or eight months

353
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,839
ago so this is a whole world in many

354
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,829
ways that doesn't have any security

355
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,660
overview or what you would call

356
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:12,359
oversight and so we could look at some

357
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,359
of the ways by which you could do this

358
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:23,510
today is you have to first take a

359
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,689
machine and get it to the point where

360
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,029
you can get its firmware so you'd have

361
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,799
to do that differently depending on the

362
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,480
machine so if you want to do an

363
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,340
extraction from Windows it's slightly

364
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,070
different to a Mac there are tools like

365
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,409
flash rom but all of these have a

366
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:44,820
constraint where you know in a way

367
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,799
you're kind of forced to trust an

368
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,210
untrusted

369
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,970
to where it could already be messed up

370
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,970
right so at that point you really would

371
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,960
want to have a third party or a trusted

372
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,299
system that you built out so that's

373
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,299
again one more point where John Murray's

374
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,340
efforts could come in handy where you

375
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,840
know we would have a certain guarantee

376
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,559
that we are not locked into like that

377
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:16,919
yeah that's the the thing else I started

378
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,620
to work back industry about 18 months

379
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,260
years ago and I didn't work with with

380
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,340
with in the that industry for about 15

381
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,890
years so my background is a chip

382
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,820
designers and then after I divert to

383
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,169
other tasks and and I was amazed that 15

384
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,240
years layers we were using the same kind

385
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,110
of tools to test this software so

386
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,140
nothing changed in 15 years why I was

387
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,450
looking at Linux and how the software

388
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,880
developments change and everything has

389
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,789
changed from CBS 2's be ensued gate and

390
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:55,740
hold that things and and the way we are

391
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,279
testing software at scale and we started

392
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,799
with our small engineering team to think

393
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,279
that the film as security is a strong

394
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,010
issue especially when we are we

395
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,440
certificates active hangings because we

396
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,840
are gaining servers which are two to

397
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,580
three years old without any firmware

398
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,850
updates so eme system BIOS don't go

399
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,679
supported by OD arms the machine is

400
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,750
still up and running and can can last

401
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,169
for the next couple of years and so two

402
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,820
options either we scrapped the

403
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,080
motherboard because there is security

404
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,870
issues and we find ways to keep these

405
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,700
boards up and running so that's that's

406
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,549
why we started to work on Linux boot but

407
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,070
the this was not fixing one of the major

408
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,559
issue how can we test Linux boot even if

409
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,279
I'm trusting Linux we still can insert I

410
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,799
shouldn't say malware but we can we can

411
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,320
misconfigured the kernel or we can miss

412
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,240
configure the firmware in a way that

413
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,059
it's becoming unsecured and one of the

414
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,090
groan that we had by helping our own

415
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,450
teams is clearly to use the brute force

416
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,570
and try to write as

417
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,120
any test procedure that we can to try to

418
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,740
hack and and and kill a Linux boot on

419
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,330
OCP servers and check if everything

420
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,940
works so that's why we try to scare the

421
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,279
testing platforms to a number of nodes

422
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,100
and getting as many tests written down

423
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,440
so right now the whole testing platform

424
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,990
is open source so you can contribute to

425
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,269
the testing infrastructure this is

426
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,929
within the Linux boot people and the

427
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,149
test that were running are not yet open

428
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:36,889
source that's not a wish from outside

429
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,769
this is just because we are lacking

430
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,159
bandwidth human human resource bandwidth

431
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,830
and we we are currently hiring resources

432
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,919
on this should be fixed in q1 2019 so

433
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,690
new ingenious I'm joining the team and

434
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,820
you will see coming up a lot of testing

435
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,639
procedures for Linux go to my but I

436
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:58,220
think we you should be able to test to

437
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,950
use the same process for other film web

438
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,049
based like you in a fight because you fi

439
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,629
use also supported on and OCP not so

440
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,070
well while we try to introduce this

441
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,519
video a different way to think about how

442
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,240
testing film where from features and

443
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,120
security perspective and down apply the

444
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,580
same rules that everybody knows within

445
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,230
the software development industry and

446
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,409
that this is easing the task to hire new

447
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:28,970
engineers to work on these kind of

448
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,610
subjects so because when we started to

449
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,049
hire people on there they were

450
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:35,120
complaining about the fact that they

451
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
don't know anything about firmware and

452
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,879
they don't want to learn because the

453
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,610
tools are so different from what they

454
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,820
know that they didn't want to take the

455
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,370
time to learn new tools which are really

456
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,250
dedicated to a very specific to a very

457
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,490
specific work so and that's why we said

458
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,350
ok we need to open up the platform and

459
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,320
and it should be as open as we can and

460
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,129
that's that's the document goal so I'm

461
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,919
gonna swap my machine over so that we

462
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,269
can start to see some details so one of

463
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:11,360
the current things that you can you can

464
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,600
look at is when you want to analyze form

465
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,070
we're today depending on the

466
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,290
type of firmware you have to have the

467
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,270
image collection down which currently

468
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,120
has a few ways of going about it in the

469
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,880
modern MacBook surround after 2017 or

470
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,110
something you have a nice little tool

471
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,730
call if you check which allows you to

472
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,500
dump the ROM and then you can sort of

473
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,020
straightaway upload that for other

474
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,880
systems you can use flash rom there's

475
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,040
also a option and chips like where you

476
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,630
can dump dump the ROM so once you get

477
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,360
that done you have certain options which

478
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,400
is you can use something like bin wok

479
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,840
and other tools like UV parser and so on

480
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,570
and so forth to kind of split that image

481
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,100
and then start drilling down into the

482
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,690
individual items what's really

483
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,910
interesting for us from the security

484
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,020
perspective is currently I think these

485
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,030
static heuristics around for my analysis

486
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,040
is very nascent stage to the point where

487
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,920
we are pretty much all of the innovation

488
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,170
and the field seems to be taking what we

489
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,030
know to be working in the anti-malware

490
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,520
game and trying to apply it into the

491
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,410
firmware space so you could quickly

492
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,620
check for a hash and see if that comes

493
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,750
up on one of the antivirus scans and

494
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,500
things like that but if we look at it

495
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,320
objectively it is pretty scary to see

496
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,550
that unless you're able to instrument it

497
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,420
and see it

498
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,550
executing in the actual context and in

499
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,680
the actual system there's not a lot of

500
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,360
there's not a lot of certainty that what

501
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,240
you're seeing is is the reality so

502
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,080
that's a pretty scary deal second taking

503
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
a bunch of heuristics that's worked in

504
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
normal anti-malware space and directly

505
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,130
deploying it into this thing is kind of

506
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,440
misinformed in my humble opinion because

507
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,540
it's going to beat you into you know a

508
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,340
ton of false positives and things like

509
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,890
that so the funny thing for us is even

510
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,260
though we have a sort of a funnel to try

511
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,460
and isolate based on just the corner

512
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,840
cases that we've seen in the past few

513
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,600
months of just looking at the Lenovo

514
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,580
rootkit although those things are out

515
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,070
out of the window because we have seen

516
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,810
in some of the other variants none of

517
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,420
the Avs pick it up so we're back to kind

518
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,660
of

519
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,580
square one where we'd have to kind of

520
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,430
manually certified that's why having the

521
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,600
real system and being able to to see it

522
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,470
execute is is vastly important so it is

523
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,720
possible to construct a system using

524
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,270
only open source effort I think just a

525
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,100
couple of weeks ago there was a release

526
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,350
by a group that's supported by the

527
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,800
German government called Factory so you

528
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,860
could build your own rig where you can

529
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,800
use things like pin walk write up your

530
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,590
own yarra signatures right up on your

531
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,110
own clamavi stuff and and then deploy it

532
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,130
on a particular firmware but in our

533
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,220
opinion we need to have a central source

534
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,880
of ground truth and it's not clear to me

535
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,940
whether that is going to be a viable

536
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,280
thing just using the open source model

537
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,020
because a lot of the manufacturers have

538
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,560
their own what you would call

539
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,150
motivations in the space so in our own

540
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,720
case we are now starting to see that

541
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,570
some of our customers have certain you

542
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,130
know parameters like we may not disclose

543
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,500
some of the things that they have right

544
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,320
so yes it is possible to construct

545
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,690
everything using open source tooling but

546
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,750
I you know having that central ground

547
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,640
truth repository is going to be a

548
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,490
challenge in in my view at least I have

549
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,170
struggled with it to find something

550
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,820
that's out there that gives you an easy

551
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,790
way to just go and check so that's part

552
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,920
of the reason why we've started to go

553
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,600
down that track and and the other

554
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,170
complexity comes along where we have

555
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,450
firmware for which there there is not a

556
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,880
lot of scrutiny at this point in time

557
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,940
like your routers and and printer

558
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,000
firmware like we have another friend

559
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,040
group who just found out a bug in in the

560
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,990
epsilon from where so how do you make a

561
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,740
single source of truth for all these

562
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,480
different things and then how do you

563
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,250
reorganize the static techniques that

564
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,810
we've had in the normal anti-malware

565
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,380
game to sort of work with this new space

566
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:58,730
so with that you know we have things

567
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,800
where you could you could you know take

568
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,580
a look at all those tools or you could

569
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,400
use something like a more and take a

570
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,310
look at let's say let's take a look at a

571
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,820
submission that was done so the idea is

572
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,060
simple you just go and go to your phone

573
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,500
where and you just pick it up and you

574
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,750
hit open hopefully this is connected to

575
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:33,590
the network and then you just hit a

576
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,690
button it is saying uploading in my

577
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,940
status bar but I don't think you can see

578
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,420
it in that screen there there you go so

579
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,910
the idea is to have for any sort of

580
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,670
firmware a simple tool like this way you

581
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,770
can choose the file pop it in and then

582
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,580
it gives you the analysis so in this

583
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,120
case you can have a bunch of stuff that

584
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,830
gets you started off on the right track

585
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,330
and at a glance we can start looking at

586
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,860
you know the total number of executables

587
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,250
found the executables of interest right

588
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,580
now as I said is not accurate in my view

589
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,010
because we are just retrofitting a lot

590
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,420
of the techniques that we used in the

591
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,640
normal AV game I think a lot more bad

592
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,960
stuff will be found once gamma-rays

593
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,040
infrastructure and our efforts in that

594
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,250
area are going to get more mature and

595
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,970
this I think is that famous place where

596
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,540
you could look at my yeah there you go

597
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,980
so that's the cert that literally says

598
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:52,160
do not trust and it's also expired so

599
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,860
this is from a production machine that

600
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,900
is released this year

601
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,660
and this is the state this is not an old

602
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,049
machine this is a 2018 so this is where

603
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:07,140
we stand at this point in time with with

604
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,660
all of this so it is a bit scary for me

605
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,210
I was frankly gobsmacked because I

606
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,100
didn't think this sort of a thing could

607
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,799
be possible coming in from the world a

608
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,330
bowel ring - one we have had router

609
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,760
firmware where we were able to give our

610
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,140
clients everything from default

611
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,549
passwords to you know exploitable web

612
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:31,730
front-ends that they weren't aware of

613
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,250
things like that so for us the goal is

614
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,570
to not have me sit down with scotch tape

615
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,240
and a huge machine and be you know

616
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,940
forced to do that because it can't scale

617
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,740
you just can't do that with thousands of

618
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,169
you need to have everything programmatic

619
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:50,610
that's why I'm excited by the fact that

620
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,860
John Murray's team is going to work on

621
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,940
an actual API yeah and if you want to

622
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,559
know more about the API you have to come

623
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,929
to my talk tomorrow so yes just

624
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,780
advertising it so the thing is all of

625
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,330
this works is on it's done by committee

626
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,250
that's community driven so if you want

627
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,590
to participate to the API and provide

628
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,720
feedback sand and all these things on

629
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,160
everything which they open-source

630
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,070
forever so that's the that's that's

631
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,850
really key to us and even the platform

632
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,740
and younger platform that we are

633
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,890
deploying is currently open source so we

634
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,169
are still using a couple of proprietary

635
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,210
components we have no choice for some of

636
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,900
them but we are trying to enhance all of

637
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,640
this so this is just the beginning of

638
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,270
the story and I really think when his

639
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,309
key is just to bring the firmware

640
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:44,549
software industry into a new century

641
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,650
because you know last time I was in

642
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,049
Taiwan I was shocked by the way that

643
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,630
we're testing their film we're but

644
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,940
somebody was entering the yeah my new

645
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,309
and just clicking activating features

646
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:59,429
and thing and no building works and

647
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:02,309
checking a piece of paper and I said

648
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:05,280
okay I think the most of the mistakes

649
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,290
are puny coming from the Union who is

650
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,510
running the test all day long and that's

651
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,890
that's not is or

652
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,810
fault that's because this is a super

653
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,240
boring job and you can miss some tests

654
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,090
so that's the thing and and the only one

655
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,190
way to test that properly is just to

656
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,080
automate as much as we can so that's

657
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,730
that's the current goal of the project

658
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,960
and this is what we're doing with our

659
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,710
own so even from our point of view as we

660
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,780
go down further this rabbit hole the

661
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,620
idea is when we expand human analysis on

662
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,150
a singular firm where we don't want to

663
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,860
keep doing that we want to only tackle

664
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,050
what would be changing or difference and

665
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,300
all of that is not possible unless you

666
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,910
have the whole thing end-to-end in one

667
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,300
cohesive system so we're still at the

668
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,000
very early days in our case you know we

669
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,970
were literally incorporated this year so

670
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,430
sort of so it's running at a very

671
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,350
breakneck pace our aim is to open-source

672
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,210
most of it except for the stuff that we

673
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,640
are not allowed to do to external

674
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,410
customer demands and things like that

675
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,310
so and that's always a challenge because

676
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,860
I think one of the things that struck me

677
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,470
from the Intel talk today morning is you

678
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,270
know it is a binary block at the end of

679
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,400
the day that they're giving so you know

680
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,220
you have that tension of you know Ron

681
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,450
likes to joke that it's called the

682
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,490
golden rule they who have the gold make

683
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,880
the rules so we can't sort of say that

684
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,260
we're going to open source everything

685
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,720
because some of those people will be

686
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,250
very upset with us and that would be a

687
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,830
company ending exercise for from where

688
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,990
we stand at this point in time so there

689
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,520
are a lot of good tool vendors

690
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,010
especially like if you want to look at

691
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,490
even the disassemblers we have a special

692
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,860
relationship with binary ninja and and

693
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,140
we want to push that relationship to the

694
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,300
point where we could have some of these

695
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,700
things of the dynamic analysis happening

696
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,420
also over the web so the idea is to

697
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,180
start to go towards this place where we

698
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,430
can have a single former security

699
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,260
analysis platform that's pretty serious

700
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,370
and works well and people don't have to

701
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,770
kind of burn down the room trying to set

702
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,420
up all the equipment which I did a

703
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,420
couple of months ago so and I found

704
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,460
great help from bothering framel and Ron

705
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,780
and everybody on swags

706
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,940
Hey am I going to you know blow this up

707
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,790
and so you don't want that because you

708
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,360
want your engineers to be focused on

709
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,670
just getting to the the meat of it and

710
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,860
you know you could potentially do all of

711
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,930
the stuff using using ready-made and

712
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,170
available techniques but I think the

713
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,140
challenge is as you continue to go to

714
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,830
scale I would find it hard to believe

715
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,470
that as you know many different people

716
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,120
with different different databases would

717
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,770
be better off than trying to at least

718
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,080
have one common ground truth place like

719
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,880
today for example and security will be a

720
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,630
virustotal

721
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,790
right if you want to do a quick check on

722
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,179
a known or bad hash why do people go

723
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,679
there it's simply because of the fact

724
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,510
that it's a known you know ground truth

725
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,040
state you know so I think something like

726
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,929
that will happen in the form where

727
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,270
security space because otherwise it's

728
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,370
all a one-off analysis right so there's

729
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,429
not a lot of discipline around

730
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,168
instrumenting the space so yes so that's

731
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,850
sort of where we stand I'm certainly not

732
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,639
the expert I'm just amazed that with

733
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,300
just a little effort we are able to find

734
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,949
out so much that is pretty scary and you

735
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,210
know I didn't even have to go somewhere

736
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,010
these were actual submissions made by

737
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,679
people on the site you know and there's

738
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,630
this guy wife one of my suspects he said

739
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,418
yet don't ever tell anyone my name

740
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:55,830
because you know I don't want to get

741
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,490
trouble into company X right so they so

742
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,300
it is a it's a fun state to be in but

743
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,550
yeah this is sort of where we are at

744
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,800
this point and we're looking for help I

745
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,110
think that that's probably time for

746
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,420
question if you have you some of them

747
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,200
want to start we have one at the back

748
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,560
and one of the front so before the talk

749
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,740
was interesting couple of things one

750
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,450
comment is having worked with various

751
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,080
BIOS manufacturers IBM Here I am totally

752
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,120
not surprised secondly on par systems

753
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,650
these days we do have CI for the fame

754
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,270
where and the way we do it I don't know

755
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,740
whether that's applicable on x86 or not

756
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,130
because I

757
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,600
how you boot on x86 processor is we

758
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,990
actually provide the system ROM image

759
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,040
from the BMC and it's effectively the

760
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,890
BMC can solve it from anywhere and put

761
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,570
it in RAM somewhere and make it look

762
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,500
like around so we can HTTP from the bhp

763
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,410
a different file with the host new host

764
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,780
we can also explode the filesystem of

765
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,100
the field as files on the BMC that

766
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,110
virtually reconstitute it like Rome

767
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,990
Eva's so we can replace individual

768
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,900
components and NFS mount them from a

769
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,370
server that constantly build new

770
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,820
binaries for example so for a note I

771
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,200
know a lot of seasoned Montella BMC but

772
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,090
for those who do I don't know whether

773
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,860
it's possible to do that on x86 but it

774
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,310
has been very very useful to do CI ok

775
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,590
that's that's doable roughly it is

776
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,870
doable on x86 so we can go through the

777
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,080
BMC one of the challenge I see with that

778
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,560
is first of all I still know some

779
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,920
servers who doesn't have any BMC this

780
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,130
couldn't have you have one table it and

781
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,260
the second things we are just moving the

782
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,920
issue to the BMC in the end because we

783
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,540
want to test the globe on fill my stack

784
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,380
on the servers and and then we need to

785
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,740
instrument the BMC on just a bishop yet

786
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,990
so roughly we are currently working with

787
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,170
the open BMC I'm not a big fan of super

788
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,570
fat complex BMC iam so it just turned

789
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,200
you that so but I'm more of the guys who

790
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,150
believes that the server is meant to be

791
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,140
turn on stay on and reset so that's it

792
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,600
and if it doesn't work for a couple of

793
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,430
seconds so it has to be reset and the

794
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,410
fact of three reset it doesn't work so

795
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,200
just shut it down and and don't don't

796
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,430
try to know what's up being on the

797
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,660
machine so and and and and to me open

798
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,810
BMC all all the BMC frameworks are

799
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,050
inserting new securities right so that's

800
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,390
the dude in some way to these kind of

801
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,460
features because you can you can upgrade

802
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,130
or you can fake some firmware image from

803
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:50,740
the BMC

804
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:58,000
your BMC is hacked we have secured boots

805
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,040
yeah and i'm convinced that there is a

806
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,920
switch is made on top of that so you're

807
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,600
right and the BMC's have been a source

808
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,280
of from in fact that is hardware

809
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,619
features in most being common BMC chips

810
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,750
out there that allow you to back off the

811
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,930
BMC from from the from the host but to

812
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,150
answer your question so on OCP system

813
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,240
x86 you get some generation who doesn't

814
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,330
have high-end BMC so they rely on ami

815
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,090
chips so which also sucks because the

816
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,750
firmware is totally locked but some of

817
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,860
them are relying on a speed BMC so I I

818
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,200
bet that this is the same kind of EMC

819
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,650
you are using on the IBM system so we we

820
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,040
have this kind of features we we try not

821
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,290
to using them within the CI that's

822
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,930
because we wants to be server agnostic

823
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,780
and we thought that the best way to be

824
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,760
server agnostic is just to be plugged on

825
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,340
the spy bus or the flash bus and that's

826
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:05,859
it you've been talking about the

827
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:07,359
firmware submissions that you've been

828
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,920
getting and that you're amazed about

829
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,109
what your analysis of those submissions

830
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:13,480
has been finding but is that information

831
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,400
actually finding its way back to the

832
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,070
manufacturers and if so do they actually

833
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,660
learn lessons from that I don't think so

834
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,040
this is a great question thank you for

835
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,619
asking because I can't get start of my

836
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:33,010
soapbox um short answer is well it

837
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,800
depends on who is asking them so if we

838
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,660
or some average person asked them

839
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,490
probably they're just gonna ignore you

840
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,720
in fact at top research a friend of mine

841
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,480
tried to find somebody in Epson that he

842
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,700
can speak to about an issue that they

843
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,340
have found he was unsuccessful this is

844
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,590
somebody who taught at blackhat for 10

845
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,369
years so he's a known entity and he you

846
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:00,070
know frankly failed to get anywhere with

847
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,340
that so

848
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,460
the the quick answer is what we are

849
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,220
doing now is that our customers are

850
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,910
scary so they can possibly cause some

851
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,920
change in behavior because there's more

852
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,110
scary now two guys with a laptop and a

853
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,840
bunch of infrastructure right so depends

854
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,270
on who is asking so if you're saying

855
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,160
have you guys seen any instances of

856
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,080
behavior modification based on the

857
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,690
analysis that we are supplying we are

858
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,000
going to see that happen thanks to our

859
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,810
customers

860
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,430
perhaps not due to us because they have

861
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,920
got far more bigger checkbooks and

862
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,680
decision making powers than individual

863
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,540
researchers the other thing that I

864
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,150
wanted to highlight here let me maybe am

865
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,700
full up differently on that so are you

866
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,490
doing any tracking across those reports

867
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,640
like for example are you keeping any

868
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,770
track of whether an issue that you found

869
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,680
in version one is also still present in

870
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,050
version two yes so we we are not just

871
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,140
tracking across the same product line we

872
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,940
are also tracking for the similar issues

873
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,130
across our roms to find out if

874
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,240
something's tripping and the great thing

875
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,280
about this field is as we develop a new

876
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,380
heuristic we're gonna reef run it on

877
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,300
everything that we have to see if we can

878
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,300
find out so yes that is we do want to

879
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,180
have that constant checking that's

880
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,520
another place where John Murray's ideas

881
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,830
are so useful because it makes it easier

882
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,770
for us to create that pipeline where you

883
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,170
could quickly check and sort of you know

884
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:39,150
make sure that something is not a repeat

885
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,610
I'm forgetting the QA term for it you

886
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:42,910
know

887
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,110
yes question so the other thing that was

888
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,510
a bit amazing is there are white lists

889
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,000
out there in the space where there was

890
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,700
an effort by the chipset guys they had a

891
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,070
white list for euphy executables that's

892
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,840
not been updated since about a year

893
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,660
right now right so I have been bothering

894
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,080
them in various ways so right now I

895
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,050
think the way people think about

896
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:11,230
firmware is another potential barrier

897
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,810
because everyone sort of I think it's

898
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,790
like as some kind of a mind trick that

899
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,319
these guys have played where everyone

900
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:19,829
just trust their hardware like they can

901
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,239
it's just funny because you know you're

902
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,489
generally more skeptical about software

903
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:28,539
but you can't force people to just think

904
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:30,069
the same way about their hardware

905
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,859
because even I was too you know in that

906
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:35,019
camp at least two years ago I think my

907
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,239
views change when I had the sudden bug

908
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:39,549
that was disclosed by Intel and it

909
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:42,579
started me thinking that hey nothing on

910
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,650
my current ring minus one security stack

911
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,420
and even check for what's going on here

912
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,499
right so so I think part of it's just

913
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,719
this mindset about firmware that is

914
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,759
really hard to break like I've spoken to

915
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,319
guys like Ron we've been doing for

916
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,779
thirty years he screamed himself to the

917
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:01,390
wall and you know I think someday it

918
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,949
might change yeah and so right now our

919
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:08,859
best answer is we are working with some

920
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,690
customers who are pretty powerful so

921
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,150
maybe they can drive a faster response

922
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,579
from some of the manufacturers the other

923
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:18,009
thing is that I think maybe some other

924
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:19,779
phone where people are playing with an

925
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,579
extremely tight margin they don't have

926
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,940
resources to invest into those kinds of

927
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,589
things I mean their margin is already

928
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,959
under high pressure so maybe there's a

929
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,940
good reason for that it always goes back

930
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,979
to you know who's making the goal or

931
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:36,309
who's giving the gold right so yeah but

932
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,529
hopefully it will change hopefully it

933
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,880
will start to get more I don't know

934
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:49,259
safer I think oh yes

935
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,150
so I see that you also extract

936
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,940
information about DTLS certificates to

937
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,280
perform some security check on the TLS

938
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,359
certificates you mean to say for stuff

939
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,650
like expiry or yeah also if the if the

940
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,210
modulus is really prime and not just

941
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,150
some pseudo prime something like that

942
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,670
yeah that's sort of the next bits on our

943
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,950
roadmap where we want to do not just

944
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,420
that but also check out which parts are

945
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,720
using which certificates for their

946
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,140
attestation and so forth so yeah we've

947
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,270
certainly go and look into that our aim

948
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,640
is to be able to just analyze pretty

949
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,319
much anything that our customers would

950
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,430
want us to go to you know go hunt so

951
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:47,230
that's sort of the track okay why is

952
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,849
that showing red is that something that

953
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:50,079
I should be but it's because we're

954
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,789
running out of time oh yes it's not

955
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,940
going to explode don't worry

956
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,980
very quick one so and we mentioned then

957
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,980
talking about power what is the status

958
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,750
of your platform or architectural

959
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:09,640
coverage what wait you say platform as

960
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,400
in right also looking into I don't know

961
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,599
our MIPS other thing we are our aim is

962
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,970
to be agnostic so we are accepting

963
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,180
submissions from any sort of chipsets

964
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,730
and firmware manufacturers so the idea

965
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,630
is to be one source where you can submit

966
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,940
but our focus right now need to be

967
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,829
different yeah it will be different so

968
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:38,490
that's the whole beauty about this is

969
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,289
when you are doing it over as a service

970
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:42,940
you get to make your own decision tree

971
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,099
as to how something will be handled so

972
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,010
we are going to have a bit of freedom

973
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,839
once we do the initial fast analysis as

974
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,359
to how do we go about doing that some of

975
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,010
the stuff we don't we are not able to

976
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,420
handle because we we haven't written

977
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,819
anything for it just right now but the

978
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:01,210
aim is to be able to ingest anything and

979
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,299
come up with with a with a report on it

980
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:06,339
that says you know this is what's funny

981
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:09,359
about it this is what's strange about it

982
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,309
we started with what we know or what we

983
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:15,039
could learn fast to know but you know

984
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,770
over time I think that game is to map

985
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,950
out to arm to any of the the chip

986
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,740
manufacturers and and go from there so

987
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,890
we already have people submitting things

988
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,680
like video roms and stuff like that so

989
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,750
that's the beautiful thing about a web

990
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,450
service is that you know if somebody

991
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,359
uploads something then you get to decide

992
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:43,119
how to bracket it and do that and I

993
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,920
would again call as an open source

994
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,900
effort right now called factory that was

995
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,430
sponsored by the German government and

996
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,140
you can also have this kind of a

997
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,390
personal testing set up way you could

998
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,410
spin up

999
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:01,430
a firmware analysis system but I don't

1000
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,000
think they have all the different tool

1001
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,220
sets that we you know somebody more

1002
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,480
commercial would be able to leverage

1003
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,950
because some of the feeds like John

1004
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,400
Murray said aren't they aren't

1005
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,400
open-source you know they're they're not

1006
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,130
free so right you're headed here now

1007
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,050
thanks so much again our own internal

1008
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,430
money

1009
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,200
