2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,000
next speaker is Michael Cruikshank he's

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,910
freelancing journalists and analysts

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,009
coming from Australia and his talk is

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,930
mapping doomsday using open source

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,080
intelligence to monitor and predict

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:32,070
environmental conflicts he will talk

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,660
about investigations and crisis checks

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,370
purely based on publicly available data

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,559
and open source intelligence

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:46,239
please welcome my future on earth

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:47,680
applause hi everyone

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,510
glad you all came in here despite the

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,699
heat I suppose it will add a bit more

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,729
ISOs poignancy to this particular

16
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:57,159
presentation as was mentioned I'm going

17
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,199
to be talking about how we can use open

18
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:01,390
source intelligence to monitor and

19
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,839
predict environmental and climate

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:08,140
conflicts to start with on the screen

21
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,539
here you can see three images all of

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,000
these images here have two things in

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,910
common the first is that they're all

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,430
examples of data points taken through

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,679
open sources and so they they're they

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,020
form open source intelligence the one on

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,170
the left is an in satellite image of

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,500
Lake Chad taken in 2004 and the two

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,180
images on the right are from Nigeria and

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,740
Yemen both taken in more recent years

31
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,960
and they're the ones on the right are

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,539
both from social media I think in this

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,429
case Twitter the other thing all of

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,740
these images have in common is that

35
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:46,330
they're all related to environmental and

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,520
climate conflicts so when we talk about

37
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,740
climate conflicts and climate change

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,479
it's very important for us to remember

39
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,940
that climate change is not a future

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,800
problem when we talk when the media

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,259
talks about climate change more often

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,450
than not it talks about okay and 10 or

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,150
15 or 20 years it's going to be this bad

44
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,340
but we need to remember when we're using

45
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,408
this kind of investigation that climate

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,360
change is already here the climate

47
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,640
crisis is already impacting many

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,230
different parts around the world indeed

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,849
scientists say that the world's global

50
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,069
temperature on average has risen by

51
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:22,450
about one degree since pre-industrial

52
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:23,380
times moreover even in the best case

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,179
scenario where

54
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,820
somehow the nations of the world get

55
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,490
together and manage to cut emissions in

56
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,739
time to make their targets for the Paris

57
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,720
climate agreement this will still not be

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,210
fast enough to avoid significant

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,090
catastrophic effects from climate change

60
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,550
and among the most catastrophic are

61
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:47,170
these effects of these effects sorry are

62
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,760
the conflicts which are caused by it now

63
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,100
when we talk about climate change and

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,480
conflict it's important to understand

65
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,260
that climate change can either be an

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,590
initiator or a multiplier of conflict by

67
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,660
initiator I mean that a singular I

68
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,030
suppose climate disaster or an ominous

69
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,720
climate event caused by climate change

70
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,160
can be something that sets in motion I

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,310
suppose cascade of escalation that

72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,620
starts a conflict however more often

73
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,170
than not climate change serves as a

74
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,180
multiplier of pre-existing tensions or

75
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,459
conflicts that are already running in

76
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,230
Regent's so in the case studies that

77
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,440
you're going to see further on in this

78
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,940
presentation we'll be looking at two

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,490
forms where climate change is playing

80
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,820
the role of a multiplier but why are we

81
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,920
doing this the reason is that when we're

82
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,810
reporting on climate change I myself am

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,369
a journalist and I've reported on both

84
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,970
conflicts and Wars as well as

85
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,800
environmental issues in the past and

86
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,300
often it's mentioned as a side note in

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,730
articles okay there's this conflict

88
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,670
that's going on and there has been some

89
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,030
perhaps talk about how it is linked to

90
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,980
climate change but what I'm proposing

91
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,990
today is that there are better ways that

92
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,359
we can go about this through doing a

93
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,130
more thorough investigation using open

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,130
source intelligence we can make this

95
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,910
link more clear or disprove it as it may

96
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:14,019
be and therefore we can make stronger

97
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:17,048
political and media narratives sir

98
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,790
here are some visualizations of the kind

99
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,789
of link between climate vulnerability

100
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,430
and conflicts up on the screen you can

101
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,010
see a map of Africa the areas which are

102
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,070
shaded darker represent areas of higher

103
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,599
climate vulnerability and within the

104
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,729
numbers within these red circles

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,090
represents catalogued conflict events as

106
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,219
can be

107
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,260
in this image there is at least a weak

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,410
correlation between the areas that have

109
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,440
higher climate vulnerability and higher

110
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,620
amounts of conflict moreover the same

111
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,719
trend also appears in South Asia this

112
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,570
time in the red circles you have

113
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,900
fatalities from conflict and again in

114
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:02,380
places like Pakistan Myanmar you have

115
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,750
vastly higher numbers of fatalities

116
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,840
which correspond to the higher climate

117
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,460
vulnerability

118
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,260
now here you were a quote from Rose

119
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,359
Marie de Caro who's a un political

120
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,740
affairs chief and she noted that major

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,630
armies and businesses have long

122
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,520
recognized the need to prepare for

123
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,169
climate related risks rightfully

124
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,770
assessing climate change as a threat

125
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,570
multiplier but how can we analyze

126
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,990
climate change as a conflict multiplier

127
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:32,080
as we discussed earlier one way is open

128
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,539
source intelligence what is open source

129
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,729
intelligence also known colloquially as

130
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:39,940
AHS into OS int depending on how you

131
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,750
pronounce it what it is is information

132
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,070
and investigations based on information

133
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,669
that's taken from publicly available

134
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,020
sources also known as open sources now

135
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,250
what kind of things are we talking about

136
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,650
here well in the last sort of 15 to 10

137
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,870
decade 15 years and maybe a decade or so

138
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,669
there has been an absolute explosion in

139
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,490
the amount of data that can be accessed

140
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,440
openly through social media is probably

141
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,389
the most obvious implementation of this

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,090
but then you also have a large and

143
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:12,039
growing number of open databases in the

144
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,109
last three or four years you've been

145
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,870
able to access vastly more and better

146
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,880
quality satellite imagery then in the

147
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,440
past the kind of things that two decades

148
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,930
ago only nation-states would have access

149
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,940
to now a single person sitting in their

150
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,300
bedroom can have access to what

151
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,979
militaries had 20 or 10 years ago

152
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,490
moreover you've got things like position

153
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:35,469
monitoring systems many large ships and

154
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,580
aircrafts can all be tracked actively on

155
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:42,310
certain platforms now once you have all

156
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,250
of this information this can be boiled

157
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,229
down into investigations and used for

158
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,940
certain things

159
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,248
among the more common I suppose

160
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,289
strategies that you find open-source

161
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:56,649
intelligence being used or applied with

162
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:58,959
our geolocation which you can see an

163
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,449
example of on the screen this is from an

164
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,330
investigation that I did into a bombing

165
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:07,689
in Yemen and this is an example of how

166
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,818
you can take a single image identify

167
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,099
visual elements within this image

168
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:15,819
compare that to a satellite image and

169
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,498
work out exactly where it was taken this

170
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,649
is very useful for proving that

171
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:22,629
something did or did not happen and even

172
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,919
when you're going from a source which

173
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:26,439
isn't particularly good in this case

174
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,339
mint Press News which is a particularly

175
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:32,499
conspiratorial website in my opinion

176
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:36,399
however the information contained in the

177
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:38,830
image is not is it doesn't matter

178
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,289
whether the source is propaganda the

179
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,589
information contained can be proved so

180
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,839
this is why techniques like geolocation

181
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,639
are useful similarly you have Crono

182
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,099
location where you use other elements

183
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,399
within images to determine the time that

184
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:56,378
it was taken of most obvious way of

185
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,509
doing assist via shadows in the position

186
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,669
of the Sun in the sky and then finally

187
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,439
comparative monitoring where you monitor

188
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,808
a region or a particular city or a town

189
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:09,729
or even a very small area over a long

190
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:12,129
period of time and observe changes here

191
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:14,308
are some common tools which are used

192
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,240
within open source intelligence

193
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,949
obviously Twitter is a really good

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,219
source so TweetDeck is a great way of

195
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,569
accessing huge numbers of tweets at once

196
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,429
Facebook groups often have a whole lot

197
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,469
of hidden information that is well I

198
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:29,289
suppose semi open that one can access if

199
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,819
you join the group and this is also a

200
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,039
very good source of information then

201
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,829
you've got telegram channels similar

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,360
deal location-based snapchat searches

203
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:39,279
which is also sometimes interesting

204
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,599
because people often feel that snapchat

205
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,250
is a more personal thing and they're not

206
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,529
sharing it with as many people but

207
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,769
sometimes you can again search based on

208
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:50,380
location then with satellite imagery the

209
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,029
most obvious tool is Google Earth which

210
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,630
is very powerful especially given that

211
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:58,569
you can access historic imagery you've

212
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,130
got which map here which is kind of like

213
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:03,459
Google Earth I suppose or Google Maps

214
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,720
however any person can annotate what

215
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,180
they're seeing on the map

216
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,639
and also you can access different kinds

217
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,250
of satellite images often especially in

218
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,040
places in the Middle East Bing Maps for

219
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,839
some reason has more up-to-date

220
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,040
satellite imagery so using we can meet

221
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,980
Wikipedia Maps

222
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,480
sorry wiki map here I should say you can

223
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,069
switch through the different imagery

224
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,740
providers until you find one that has

225
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:28,660
up-to-date data then you have more

226
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,529
commercial systems like planets and

227
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,480
digital globe

228
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,399
both of these are paid services however

229
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,879
often content can be accessed through

230
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,389
them without having to pay huge amounts

231
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,220
of money

232
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,689
then one final one which I'm going to go

233
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,720
into quite a bit of depth on how to use

234
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:45,790
today is called IO browser which is very

235
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,949
useful especially in the context of

236
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,079
climate conflicts because you can use

237
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:51,790
our environmental monitoring satellites

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,888
and the data from these satellites in

239
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,779
order to track huge areas of the globe

240
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,490
and some of the climatic changes that

241
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,699
are happening both on a macro and a

242
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,350
micro scale on data bases you've got

243
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:05,740
things like act led the armed conflict

244
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,240
live events database which is I also use

245
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,540
later in this presentation I'll show you

246
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,519
how to use it has acts it has

247
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,290
information and data points on almost

248
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,850
every conflict zone around the world and

249
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,709
it's incredibly detailed and I would

250
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,660
highly recommend anyone doing sort of

251
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,189
investigations into any kind of armed

252
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,889
conflict really look into these data

253
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:28,089
sets if you're looking at anything kind

254
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,709
of related to US military equipment NSN

255
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,750
now is a platform where you can look up

256
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,899
the serial numbers of particular items

257
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,329
and to try to find out where they're

258
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,920
from who makes them etc you've got

259
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,628
business registries which is also

260
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,120
interesting if you're doing more

261
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:45,309
business focused innocent investigations

262
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,990
and then one final one is leaked ID

263
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,939
databases there are a large amount of

264
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,189
databases of people's IDs which can be

265
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,529
accessed online whether discounts as an

266
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:57,719
open source opposes up to your opinion

267
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:00,250
however it can be used to make your

268
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,839
investigation more powerful if you if it

269
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,319
can help you find a missing link in an

270
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,779
investigation then finally one to other

271
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:10,449
really important tools reverse image

272
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,970
searching which I am sure most of you

273
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:14,410
are familiar with it's basically to

274
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,939
searching an image and finding images

275
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,980
that are really similar and that way you

276
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,610
can find out how genuine and images when

277
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,579
it first

278
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,929
published etc and often find similar

279
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,209
images that look like it that can help

280
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,559
you find where it was taken and finally

281
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,599
you have a tool called Sun calc which

282
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,059
you can see up on the screen and it

283
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,699
enables you to see the exact position of

284
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,988
the Sun in the sky at any given point in

285
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,939
time

286
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:41,499
you've got visualized there the position

287
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:45,549
of the Sun in the sky now over this town

288
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:47,230
I forget what it's called in German so

289
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,569
that's gone to some case studies of how

290
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,009
we can actually apply these tools the

291
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:54,118
first we're going to look at is the

292
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:58,179
water crisis in Basra in our Iraq in

293
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:59,559
2018 so the story that was reported and

294
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:01,569
it did get a fair amount of attention

295
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,029
was that there are a series of violent

296
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:06,579
protests which turned into riots and

297
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,230
then crackdowns that killed at least 15

298
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,790
people in in the Iraqi city of Basra

299
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,139
which is in the south of the country

300
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:16,089
it's predominantly Shia City now during

301
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,189
this unrest government buildings were

302
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:20,199
torched as well as the HQs of pro Iran

303
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:22,719
Shia militia and the Iranian cause

304
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,969
consulate in Basra now we'll get on to

305
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
why particularly Iranian areas were

306
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,959
targeted and then finally a bit later in

307
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,259
the presentation I should say and then

308
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,479
finally the catalyst for these riots or

309
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:36,689
protests was allegedly poor sanitation

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,110
due to a lack of clean water and

311
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:42,699
government corruption and mismanagement

312
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,499
however what actually caused this poor

313
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:47,910
sanitation in the city that drove this

314
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:51,489
protest well during the summer of 2018

315
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,949
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers which

316
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:57,309
flow into a waterway known as the Shatt

317
00:12:53,949 --> 00:13:00,609
al-arab which Basra sits on the water

318
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:03,339
coming from these two rivers decreased

319
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,129
in flow and then this set off a chain of

320
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,689
events where because of the low amount

321
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,239
of water coming down the river

322
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,919
saltwater from the Persian Gulf intruded

323
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:15,309
its way up the Shatt al-arab

324
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,919
and the area around the water around

325
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,079
Basra became a to say line for water

326
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,790
treatment plants to handle indeed the

327
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,429
water wasn't drinkable it wasn't even

328
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,899
usable and this is one of the key

329
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:29,379
catalysts that got people out onto the

330
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:32,710
streets during this period the Iraqi

331
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:36,070
government blamed a series of

332
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:39,760
in Turkey and Iran for this low water

333
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,270
levels the first is the Elissa dam which

334
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,870
is appear in Turkey and then the other

335
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:51,550
is the Dargan dam which is approximately

336
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:57,220
here in Iran the area in green here used

337
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:58,810
the watershed for the Tigris River and

338
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,760
these here you can see the images of the

339
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,089
two dams both were completed very

340
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,980
recently the Elissa dam in Turkey is

341
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:10,690
substantially larger than the one in

342
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,550
Iran so if we wanted to know ah did

343
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,470
these countries really start filling up

344
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,279
these dams and cut off the water supply

345
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,810
to Iraq how would we do this the most

346
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,220
obvious way from an open source

347
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,729
intelligence perspective is using

348
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,130
satellite imagery and this is very easy

349
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,260
because dams are such huge structures

350
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,260
and even a very low resolution imagery

351
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,939
that can be taken every day you can see

352
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,459
what these dams are doing and you can

353
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:40,029
see water filling up so using this

354
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:41,979
approach sorry yep and then other

355
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,800
questions that we also might want to ask

356
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:49,120
are how can we establish a chain of

357
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,029
events that's lead from these dams if

358
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,620
they were cut to protests in Basra and

359
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,930
then finally what role did climate

360
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,920
change play so now on to these satellite

361
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:01,359
images that I spoke of a few seconds ago

362
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,120
here you have images taken from the

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,120
planet constellation there are three

364
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,980
images of Alissa damn it may be

365
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,990
difficult to see what's going on here

366
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,380
but the main structure in the middle is

367
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,570
the dam wall and the low side of the dam

368
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:21,250
is on the bottom of these pictures

369
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:24,520
they're all north-south orientated June

370
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:27,850
30 which was at the beginning of this

371
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,520
crisis in this unrest injured in Basra

372
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,209
you can see that there is very little

373
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,180
water on either side of the dam and then

374
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:39,279
by September 2 the image in the top

375
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,319
right-hand corner of the screen the

376
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,800
water level has not changed very much at

377
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,390
all on either side then finally by

378
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,430
December 15 you can

379
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,530
the dam has begun to fill and there is

380
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,810
more water on the north side of the dam

381
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,329
than there was in the past you can

382
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,560
actually access vastly larger numbers of

383
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,920
these images that more or less can

384
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,150
confirm the same progression and you

385
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,579
will see the same thing happening over a

386
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,709
longer period of time but from these

387
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,420
images what we can say is that during

388
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,050
the height of this crisis between June

389
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,490
and September this dam was not filling

390
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,380
this is despite the fact that the Iraqi

391
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,930
government continuously saying what was

392
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,750
continuously saying that they were

393
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,180
moreover if this actually congruous

394
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,590
aying about this particular dam in that

395
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,540
they'd originally planned to start

396
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,810
filling it in June however decided to

397
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,280
delay the filling of the dam with regard

398
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,400
because of requests from the Iraqi

399
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,550
government as well as trying to as a

400
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,220
gesture of goodwill towards Iraq so what

401
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,469
of the Iranian dam even though the set

402
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,500
of four images from the same source of

403
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,330
planet constellation and this dam is

404
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,910
interesting because it's got a very

405
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:53,740
obvious spillway which you can sort of

406
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:56,020
see here and then a lower outlet pipe

407
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,990
and these are the two ways that water

408
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,760
can go from the holding pond down to the

409
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,620
the river below and the river that this

410
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,660
sits on is the Suwon River which is a

411
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,680
tributary of the Tigris River that

412
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:11,770
eventually flows to Basra now in April

413
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,540
of 2018 you can clearly see water

414
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,089
flowing down both the spillway as well

415
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:20,560
as the lower outlets then by June 13

416
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,208
little water is coming down the spillway

417
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,500
and the smaller amount of water is also

418
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:27,790
coming down out of the lower outlet pipe

419
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,720
then this is when it starts to get

420
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,820
interesting by July 22 the water level

421
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,410
in the dam has noticeably dropped there

422
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,870
isn't any more water coming down the

423
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,640
spillway and indeed down here where the

424
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,959
lower outlet pipe is bit would be you

425
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,460
can see that the water level is also

426
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,880
much lower and much of the river is

427
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,550
dried-up so most likely there is little

428
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,950
or no water coming out of this pipe this

429
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,659
trend holds true through to September

430
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,160
where again you have a lower level of

431
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,670
water and nothing coming down the

432
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,670
spillway

433
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,450
so based on this could we say that this

434
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,120
entire crisis this riots and all these

435
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,860
people dying in Basra was this caused by

436
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,429
this dam being shut off was this

437
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,750
man-made well yes it is man-made

438
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:19,570
however it's bigger than just these dams

439
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,220
here's another kind of a circus of open

440
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,750
source intelligence that you can use

441
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,210
this is these are images all taken from

442
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:30,220
social media and they all show different

443
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:33,640
sections of the tigress River in early

444
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,710
June important facts about all of these

445
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,800
images they're all taken in areas that

446
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:43,960
are north of the confluence of the Suwon

447
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:47,320
and tigress River so if the water was

448
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,630
lower from the dam in Iran it should not

449
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,510
affect the water level in these pictures

450
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:56,080
however the water level in the Minh is

451
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:58,000
all very low so from this we can say

452
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,379
that the water level coming down the

453
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,110
river or the amount of water coming down

454
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,570
the river was already low and that even

455
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,899
if this dam was shut off the dam wasn't

456
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:12,040
the primary cause of this particular

457
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:15,670
crisis but what was the obvious answer

458
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,080
here is the drought in the region you've

459
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,930
got a series of different quotes here

460
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,189
from sources talking about the extent of

461
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:26,560
this drought firstly in the winter of

462
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,110
2017-18 they had 1/3 less rainfall than

463
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,060
average the Iraqi Ministry of Water

464
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,510
Resources blames this on climatic

465
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,060
conditions and lack of rainfall then you

466
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,410
have another source the Jerusalem Center

467
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,440
for Public Affairs talking about a 6

468
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,650
year long ongoing droughts characterized

469
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,360
by erratic rainfall and then finally a

470
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,980
scientific source from the Journal of

471
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,929
Earth Sciences talking about how climate

472
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,340
changes your global warming have

473
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,780
influenced the weather there and have

474
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,449
caused a general decline in

475
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:58,210
precipitation not just in the last few

476
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,220
years but indeed the last few decades so

477
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,490
this is a long-term trend which reached

478
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:06,400
an acute point in over the winter of

479
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,400
2018 that reduced the water levels and

480
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,540
then caused this crisis so what

481
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,160
conclusions can we make from this

482
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,830
particular case study firstly

483
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,800
through open-source intelligence and an

484
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,780
investigation based on this you we can

485
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,070
say that the drought and the ups in Iraq

486
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,990
and upstream countries played a

487
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,460
significant role in the unrest the

488
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,240
drought itself is linked to climate

489
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,950
change

490
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,220
moreover the blocking of flow from

491
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,680
darion dam in Iran likely exacerbated

492
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,560
this and indeed the closure of this dam

493
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,740
was perhaps also linked to this overall

494
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,210
drought Iran is in the same drought

495
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,080
conditions or at least it was at that

496
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:46,540
time as Iraq finally it's important to

497
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,470
note that this event did not happen

498
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,560
within a vacuum

499
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:53,260
Iraq is a war-torn country with very

500
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,700
weak institutions it's divided across

501
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:59,950
religious and ethnic lines and even a

502
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,050
small think an axe can act as a

503
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,440
multiplier that suddenly catapults it

504
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:08,649
into further violence so within this

505
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,210
context it's more likely to be able to

506
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,430
say that climate change played the role

507
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,430
as a multiplier rather than an initiator

508
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,379
now let's look at one further case study

509
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,940
this time I'm moving to Nigeria and

510
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,230
we're going to talk about attacks by a

511
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,720
Fulani herdsmen now the Fulani are a

512
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,700
group of mostly Muslim cattle herders

513
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,630
who live across several nations in the

514
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:36,100
Sahel region of Africa the Fulani

515
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,650
herdsmen have been grazing their cattle

516
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,379
further and further south bringing them

517
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,130
into conflict with farmers and in

518
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,480
Nigeria alone

519
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,310
the death toll from this violence is

520
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,760
over three thousand five five hundred

521
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,710
people the violence itself is often

522
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,960
blamed on climate change due to low

523
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,810
rainfall in the Sahel region and because

524
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,690
the rainfall is lower it's commonly

525
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,220
thought that the Fulani herdsmen are

526
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,650
moving their cattle further south into

527
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:07,510
more lush areas so we want to do an

528
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,670
investigation into this what are

529
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,040
questions we need to answer again we're

530
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,920
looking at are the attacks related to

531
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,350
climatic patterns does violence speak in

532
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,510
pairs does violence spike in periods of

533
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,689
low rainfall was the intensification of

534
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,490
violence in 2018 caused by an anomalous

535
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,610
climatic event yet one further thing

536
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,620
that I forgot to mention is that

537
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,169
this year there have been significantly

538
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,000
less attacks than in 2018 where there

539
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,940
was a massive spike of violence and then

540
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,790
in 2017 again it was lower

541
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,020
so was that particular spike caused by

542
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,629
an anomalous climate event that's

543
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,240
another question we want to answer so

544
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:49,030
how do we do this I mentioned earlier a

545
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,920
tool called geo browser now this is a

546
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,889
platform that enables you to access

547
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,450
imagery from a huge number of not from a

548
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,140
huge number I suppose from a limited

549
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:02,620
number of remote sensing environmental

550
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,720
monitoring satellites and the data from

551
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,510
these satellites can be visualized in a

552
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,200
number of different wavelengths or

553
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,620
different things where you can see

554
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,240
things like pollution or water or in the

555
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,459
case of what we're going to do here

556
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,910
something called normalized difference

557
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:22,090
vegetation index and what this does is

558
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:24,790
it enables us to see effectively how

559
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,800
green an area is and we can use this

560
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,980
relative greenness as a proxy for how

561
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,750
much vegetation there is and also in a

562
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,260
place which fairly which is fairly arid

563
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,610
and uh negated like the Sahel we can

564
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,280
also use it as a proxy for how much

565
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,360
rainfall there is and through EO browser

566
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:50,379
we can access this via the Sentinel 2

567
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:52,179
satellite so what areas of the country

568
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,580
do we need to focus on and to look at

569
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,050
how much vegetation there is how green

570
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,449
it is when it's looked at from

571
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,879
satellites so up on the top of the

572
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,570
screen you've got a map of the area the

573
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,760
general area where Fulani herdsmen live

574
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,889
then as you can see in Nigeria it's sort

575
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,590
of the top third or a quarter of the

576
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,290
country then what I've done using EO

577
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:18,040
browser is I've drawn a rough sort of

578
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:21,790
polygon over the area where the Fulani

579
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,580
approximately live and then I use the

580
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:27,760
tools that this program has in order to

581
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,679
look at hundreds or probably even yeah

582
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,370
probably hundreds of individual

583
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,370
satellite images and then graph over

584
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,229
time how much how much greenery there

585
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,850
was how much vegetation there was and

586
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:43,060
also by proxy

587
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,610
how much rainfall there was and the

588
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:49,510
graph you can see on the bottom right

589
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:51,699
hand corner of the screen this is over I

590
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,830
think three or four years and quite

591
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,790
clearly there are seasons that you can

592
00:24:53,830 --> 00:25:00,730
see there is a there are peaks every wet

593
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:03,100
season and this can be seen in a sort of

594
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,500
cyclical pattern part of the reason why

595
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,090
there are data points missing during

596
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,790
this sort of period where it's going up

597
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,600
into the wet season is because I've used

598
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:15,760
a tool that enables me to remove all of

599
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,790
the images that have high cloud cover

600
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,110
and as you'd expect in the wet season

601
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,730
you're going to have lots of images

602
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,590
where you can't see anything because

603
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,020
it's covered in clouds and I've removed

604
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,820
all of those data points you can this

605
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,620
slider bar that you can also see in this

606
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,600
image can be increased and decreased and

607
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,850
you can see to see sort of see more or

608
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,469
less data points however once you start

609
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:40,389
including all of the images you get a

610
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:42,610
lot of outliers so we've got the data on

611
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,530
over the last few years this point of

612
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,959
time that we want to look at what the

613
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:49,750
relative levels of greenery and rainfall

614
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,300
in this region were then we need to

615
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,190
compare this with the number of attacks

616
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,680
and conflict or the amount of conflict

617
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,570
in the region so we turn to another

618
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,880
source I mentioned earlier which is the

619
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,460
armed conflict location and event data

620
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,380
project and what I did then or what

621
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,780
anyone can do is just go to their

622
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,120
website and then you can generate huge

623
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,270
databases of all of the recorded attacks

624
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,850
by one group by two groups or by region

625
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,490
or some or another field of your choice

626
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,230
and then you get all of this data it's

627
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,870
displayed kind of like what you can see

628
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,610
here they've got information on

629
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,500
fatalities you've got information on

630
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,729
things like where exactly the attack

631
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,950
took place and what the sources were etc

632
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:36,250
and then through all this data you can

633
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:40,690
get an idea of the intensity and the

634
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:43,120
deadliness of a conflict over time which

635
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:47,020
is what you see here this is for 2017

636
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,050
2018 and it's the number of a Fulani

637
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:53,440
attacks and casualties over this 2-year

638
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,860
period and as you can see this spike of

639
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,640
I

640
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,428
in 2018 is very prevalent here it's very

641
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,290
obvious and then finally in the bottom

642
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:04,299
right it's kind of difficult to see but

643
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,909
this is also a map of the agricultural

644
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,290
calendar of a typical year in Nigeria

645
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,809
pointing out some of this sort of

646
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,760
important seasons and it's worth noting

647
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,500
here that the livestock migration which

648
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:20,620
particularly pertains to the Fulani is

649
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:23,650
between a February and August so let's

650
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,840
compare it all we've got the index of

651
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,570
vegetation which is a proxy for the

652
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,449
rainfall then we've got over the same

653
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:34,540
period of time fit to the same scale

654
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,340
all the attacks and from this we can see

655
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,549
we can see some interesting things start

656
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,399
to happen firstly there does appear

657
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:46,690
every wet season to be a decline in the

658
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,669
number of attacks and given that this

659
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,190
conflict is driven by herders as I

660
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,740
mentioned a few minutes ago moving their

661
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,970
cattle further south in ten times when

662
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,070
it's dry and there's not much vegetation

663
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,419
in the north of the country it would

664
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,030
make sense that during the wet season

665
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:03,040
when there's more vegetation for their

666
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,230
cattle to graze on they will not be as

667
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,799
frequently in conflict with pastoralists

668
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,530
further south and then in the dry season

669
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:16,660
you can see that the relative levels of

670
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:20,379
violence are higher however this 2018

671
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,809
spike in violence was it precipitated by

672
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:26,230
an anomalous event in terms of rainfall

673
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:29,520
or the lack of vegetation looking at

674
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:32,910
this data it doesn't look to be the case

675
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,260
there is not any significant amount of

676
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,530
significant reduction in the amount of

677
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:42,730
greenery in the time preceding this

678
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:44,770
spike of violence so what does this tell

679
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,220
us it tells us that more likely than not

680
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:52,299
this particular spike in violence is not

681
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:54,040
related to a climatic cause rather the

682
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,809
actual despite itself or the secured

683
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,470
amount of violence was instead

684
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:02,230
instigated by a political development in

685
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,830
the region and indeed this is backed up

686
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,600
by I think a study done by crisis group

687
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,370
I believe it was that

688
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,990
looked at this particular conflict and

689
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,659
came to the same conclusions through a

690
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,750
very different kind of methodology more

691
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:20,980
by talking to people on the ground

692
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:23,980
however the overall conflict is driven

693
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,720
by the area drying out and this is

694
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:30,130
something which has been catalogued over

695
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,870
a long period of time so some things

696
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,750
need to be considered here firstly that

697
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:37,179
based on this remote sensing data the

698
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,640
attacks are driven by low vegetation and

699
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,710
low rainfall and indeed the continuing

700
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,280
desertification of the Sahel region will

701
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:48,850
intensify this problem however up and

702
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,850
large spikes or outlying years can't

703
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,199
always be linked to particular climatic

704
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,260
events because clearly there are

705
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,650
political factors at play and then given

706
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,390
all of this it's more I suppose more

707
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,250
correct for us to say that climate

708
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,290
change is only a piers to be playing a

709
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,570
role as a background driver of this

710
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,240
conflict which is interesting given that

711
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,800
often the media narrative overall is

712
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,590
that the single cause of this conflict

713
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,510
is climate change which is certainly a

714
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:21,610
large part of it however there are other

715
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:23,650
factors at play so how do we use these

716
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,659
techniques and apply them into the

717
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,820
future if we consider that climate

718
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:31,690
change and climate conflicts will get

719
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,840
worse the first thing we need to know is

720
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,430
where to look according to the world

721
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,550
environment very the World Economic

722
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,620
Forum there are three primary factors

723
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:44,260
that make countries vulnerable to

724
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,659
climate change and climate conflicts the

725
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,030
first is a history of conflict over the

726
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,830
past five years the second is that over

727
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:53,950
40% of the country is involved in

728
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:56,020
agriculture and then the third is that

729
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,270
over 20% of the population is excluded

730
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,360
formerly from political power through

731
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:04,570
discriminatory institutions now you can

732
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,330
see two maps on the screen they show the

733
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,730
confluence of climate exposure and

734
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,949
fragility risks and in the second map

735
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,900
you can see the sort of hot spots marked

736
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:17,470
out most of them are in places like

737
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,750
Central Africa West Africa as well as

738
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,490
the Middle East and South Asia

739
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,230
it doesn't appear on this

740
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,059
map here however I would say that likely

741
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,250
the Philippines also is another spot

742
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:30,129
that it would do well to keep an eye on

743
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,570
because firstly it's got significant

744
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,280
amounts of internal conflict that's

745
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,830
already been going on for many years and

746
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,520
secondly it's incredibly vulnerable to

747
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:44,500
climatic disasters like typhoons then

748
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:47,139
when we have these places that we want

749
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,700
to look at then what can we do we can

750
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,940
choose one of them for instance and

751
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,110
apply a number of approaches some of

752
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,630
these approaches are things that we've

753
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,979
already used in this case studies

754
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,510
firstly you can use remote sensing to

755
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,790
develop a relationship between weather

756
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:03,970
and conflict and extrapolate predictions

757
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,980
I in the last few days it's been talked

758
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,850
a lot in the media about these fires in

759
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,960
the Amazon and whether they're caused by

760
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,760
policies of the BAL scenario government

761
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,710
or if they're caused by a drought or

762
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,510
something like that in the region such

763
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,850
approaches that we used for the case

764
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,770
study on Nigeria could similarly be

765
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,120
applied there to look at whether it

766
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,040
really is an anomalous in terms of

767
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,949
weather or whether political factors are

768
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,240
driving this instead another approach we

769
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,760
can use around the world is using

770
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,270
satellite imagery again to monitor day

771
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,890
by day changes in large assets like dams

772
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:40,510
reservoirs also you can use things like

773
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,340
you can look at crop fields and see how

774
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,980
much growth there has been in food and

775
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,419
then use that to monitor on a very very

776
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,610
large scale whether that's going to

777
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,010
cause disruption to food prices in a

778
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,320
region on the issue of food you can also

779
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,600
use social media to monitor key terms

780
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,970
and keep an eye on things like food

781
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,629
prices in a country and you can monitor

782
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:03,250
over time particular accounts to verify

783
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,290
that they are indeed in the region and

784
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,940
using approaches like geolocation to

785
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,159
make sure that you can actually prove

786
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,679
that they are indeed in the place they

787
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:14,320
claim they are similar things can be

788
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,850
applied to water quality I didn't

789
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,189
include it in the presentation but there

790
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,490
was a very good image that was shared on

791
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,350
Twitter of someone who was actively

792
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,790
monitoring the water in Basra during the

793
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,709
height of this crisis and pointing out

794
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,960
how our polluted and say line it was

795
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,580
some kind of images could also be

796
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,059
applied to a number of other places and

797
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,350
then finally you can use as I mentioned

798
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,450
things like act

799
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,850
have also location for all of these

800
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,530
events over time especially when your

801
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,080
access to these kind of huge data sets

802
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,510
you can map the location of all of these

803
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,060
attacks and then you can see if they're

804
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,950
changing over time and use that to sort

805
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,440
of see if that corresponds to perhaps

806
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,030
changes in climate or political changes

807
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,150
or other things and this is also a

808
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,170
different thing that can be applied so

809
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:01,740
based on all of this I hope I've given

810
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,520
you a good sort of first introduction to

811
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,070
Alison Austin

812
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,050
open-source intelligence and how this

813
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,989
can be applied in terms of climate

814
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,639
conflicts so is there any questions that

815
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:14,638
anyone has on these topics

816
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:32,299
thank you very much Michael if you would

817
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:34,978
like to ask a question do we have to

818
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:39,089
microphone angels' in a room please come

819
00:34:34,978 --> 00:34:41,549
to the 2d azar parts and ask your

820
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:43,069
question line up there if needed we have

821
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:45,629
the first question please

822
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:46,799
yes hello thank you for the presentation

823
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:52,768
very interesting

824
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:54,119
have you considered doing some starting

825
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:56,819
some kind of project or collaborating

826
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,779
with somebody already who could map this

827
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:03,450
stuff over time and essentially point

828
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:05,819
out that an internet using you know

829
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,819
coffee drinking first world place is

830
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:11,579
about to be overrun by a certain event

831
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:13,229
because every every time every year

832
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:15,630
something most closer and closer to

833
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:18,899
where people with internet are so to

834
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,849
speak it's certainly an interesting

835
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,440
concept I suppose the problem with this

836
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:27,239
is that if like given that these changes

837
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,220
are happening over an accelerating

838
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,589
timeframe but still a very long time

839
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,839
frame it's really difficult to make sort

840
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:37,410
of accurate predictions beyond a year or

841
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,729
two we can say that you know ok in a

842
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,129
certain amount of time there's going to

843
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:43,589
be a greater likelihood of conflict in a

844
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,779
region however at such long time frames

845
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:48,239
it's very difficult to say ok in this

846
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:50,519
year you will be there will be this many

847
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,900
climate refugees however we can project

848
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,308
it and say that there's probably going

849
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,259
to be like an overall increase in

850
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:57,749
conflict and then each conflict then

851
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:59,729
might generate X number of refugees and

852
00:35:57,749 --> 00:36:01,769
use this to make predictions but again

853
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:05,879
it's quite difficult to actually do this

854
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:07,229
in such long time frames thank you for

855
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,809
the answered the next question over

856
00:36:07,229 --> 00:36:15,899
there please go ahead hello have you

857
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:18,900
predicted any upcoming events yourself

858
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,479
already in the future like any

859
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,739
catastrophes or something I mean ok this

860
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:28,019
when you're doing this kind of thing

861
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:30,299
it's not like you're some Nostradamus

862
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:33,180
you're saying okay this will definitely

863
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:35,190
happen all you can do is measure overall

864
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,019
levels of increasing risk and say

865
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,880
there's a higher likelihood that this

866
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,810
will happen I mean when when we're

867
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,090
talking at things

868
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,690
timeframes greater than a year however

869
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:48,480
there is an opportunity that in cases

870
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,940
where you can see when you've already

871
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,950
established a relationship between the

872
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,710
climate and conflict or between climate

873
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,120
and political disruption once you've

874
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,970
established that relationship and then

875
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,799
you notice that there is a significant

876
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,290
anomalous event like a drought or

877
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,240
flooding which is caused significant

878
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,740
disruption you can generally make a

879
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,620
fairly good prediction that this will

880
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,930
indeed sad maybe a few weeks from then

881
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,930
or a few months from then lead to actual

882
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,520
violence or political disruption so in

883
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,500
those kind of timeframes it's possible

884
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,910
to make better predictions but longer

885
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:27,630
than that all you can really do is

886
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:29,490
probabilities thank you the microphone

887
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,730
over there your next question hello

888
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:35,509
thanks very much for your talk it seems

889
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:41,930
like this is a lot of manual effort to

890
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:48,650
to do the calculations and to check if

891
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:51,240
where and and how much conflicts are are

892
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:54,750
affected by climate change is there way

893
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,549
to just do an automated monitoring of

894
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:03,450
some sort do you have any ideas on that

895
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:06,060
it's a good question it's possible that

896
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,799
you could I mean I'm coming from a

897
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,190
background of journalism so I suppose

898
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,780
from like my sort of go-to approach

899
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,670
would be doing it from like doing it

900
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,660
human base doing it myself do not mean

901
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,220
hands-on

902
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,450
however there probably is a way of

903
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,740
automating at least some things

904
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,480
especially a lot of this data crunching

905
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,370
data sets and things like that and then

906
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,730
making a way to display all of these

907
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:29,009
events on a map there I mean these if we

908
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,390
go all the way back here somewhere the

909
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,210
if you remember where these maps were

910
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,100
where we had we we could see

911
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:38,460
Africa or South Asia these were all

912
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,290
generated through sort of algorithms

913
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:44,730
which were just plotting every single

914
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:46,380
event and these are live maps well the

915
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,670
computer is very laggy so unfortunately

916
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,380
maybe this will come from this cream a

917
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,120
bit later but these are live maps where

918
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,710
you can zoom in and they get more and

919
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,490
more detailed as you zoom in I'm the

920
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,320
screenshots that

921
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,080
you were just sort of an overview of

922
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,060
what's going on so it is possible to

923
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,740
automate this however the analysis

924
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,160
itself which is kind of the important

925
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,859
part generally has to be done at this

926
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,410
stage by a human this was the map and I

927
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,480
was talking about this is on the source

928
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,790
down here you can access this online

929
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,250
zoom in and sort of see all of the

930
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:21,110
events that are mapped okay thanks very

931
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:23,940
much my friend over there so question

932
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:28,860
thank you so much for your presentation

933
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:31,110
Amir I wanted to ask you since you have

934
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,880
to monitor a lot also social media

935
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,520
platforms how do you deal with the

936
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,410
discourse of privacy and surveillance

937
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,180
how do you protectors for the privacy of

938
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,750
the people while you're doing this act

939
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:45,390
of investigation that's a good question

940
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,130
and I mean the sources the people who

941
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,980
are sharing all of this information are

942
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,850
doing it publicly I'm not generally when

943
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,490
you're doing open source intelligence

944
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,950
you are not collecting information

945
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,020
that's on people's private pages or

946
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,089
something like that

947
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,890
moreover you're generally not trying to

948
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,330
identify the people who are actually

949
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,460
taking the footage unless it's

950
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:07,440
absolutely critical to the story because

951
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,180
the story unlike traditional journalism

952
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,640
where it's all about your sources and

953
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,830
the seniority or the Trust's the

954
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,109
trustworthiness of your sources whereas

955
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,060
in open source intelligence it's all

956
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:20,840
about the content itself and whether

957
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,279
that can be used to prove something so

958
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,470
it's less important that you need to

959
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,960
link the information or this to an

960
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:30,899
actual person and generally when you're

961
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,850
doing an investigation it can be avoided

962
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:38,760
there are of course cases where it's not

963
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:41,400
but in general it is avoided thank you

964
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,840
for your answer on my left hand side

965
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:48,590
please your question hi

966
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,850
do you so you you have a bunch of

967
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,760
datasets and you have a bunch of tools

968
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:57,509
analyzes data sets do you feel like the

969
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,660
tools are lacking and could be improved

970
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:03,119
or sort of combine data sets together

971
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,649
certainly I mean if like I mean if you

972
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,570
could automatically combine something

973
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,290
like the two data sets that I combined

974
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,810
the eoq Brown

975
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,580
and the armed conflict location event

976
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:14,160
database if those two things could be

977
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,840
combined then it would be a very

978
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,270
powerful tool that would sort of speed

979
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,470
up these investigations immensely the

980
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,440
problem is they're owned by two

981
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,120
different people so actually combining

982
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,920
the two would probably require either a

983
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:31,830
lot of money or a lot of kind of

984
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,730
negotiation okay thank you for taking

985
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,450
your time and answering all the

986
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:40,200
questions

987
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:42,560
oh one more Jeffrey just okay thank you

988
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,240
for a nice presentation and loved it and

989
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,529
besides the verbal part also the slides

990
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,540
are amazing

991
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,020
the way you did it layout but also the

992
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:54,540
content of the slides so I'd ask will

993
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:59,790
you be I'm like making the slides

994
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:02,790
available like form I can't do that

995
