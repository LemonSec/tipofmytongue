1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:16,460
[Music]

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,650
so our next speaker is Moe who works for

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,289
the Sybok foundation and see where she

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,329
will be presenting this foundation now

5
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,699
which was founded I think in 2017 in

6
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:27,290
Barcelona and we will now learn much

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:39,170
more about it so please give a warm

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:41,420
round of applause okay hello do you hear

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,750
me well yes okay thank you

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,810
so as they said my name is 'more

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,430
Accomack net and I work in cyber

12
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,520
foundation labs and it's what I'm gonna

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,810
present today it's been a long time

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,850
since I don't give a talk

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,460
so please and I didn't leave asleep very

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,180
much so please be Vanna valent with me

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,619
okay I'll talk about CFL and its story

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,299
first first of all I'll be a little bit

19
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,770
fast in the story and then I will

20
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:14,840
explain what we are up to right now so

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,158
the beginnings of the cyber foundation

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,869
was created by these two artists nail

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,709
Harbison and moon rebus that you might

24
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:28,389
know they are both considered by media

25
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:32,630
this is the two first female and male

26
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:35,420
cyborg artists and well as you can see

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,639
the CF what it does it's an organization

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,729
that encourages humans to become cyborgs

29
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,740
and promote cyber cyber Gizem as an art

30
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,990
movement so first of all I'll talk about

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:49,520
nearly Harvison inhibition is a person

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:54,829
that has its colour blind he only sees

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:58,818
in grey scale so then in 2004 he decided

34
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,298
to get an implant in his skull of an

35
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:03,229
antenna

36
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:07,429
it's called Nyborg and what it does is

37
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:10,669
that it the text it detects colors as

38
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:13,730
frequencies so he has the sound

39
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:16,760
connected to his skull and the vibration

40
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,720
the vibrations of the of the colors he

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,390
can read them so whenever he hears our

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:28,690
an F alpha its color red for example no

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:32,140
later on nowadays he's he decided he

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:35,050
wanted to get a crown a sense of time a

45
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,540
solar crown which is a sensor that it's

46
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,050
a sense that we are developing right now

47
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,739
in cyber foundation labs these time

48
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,700
sense is very interesting because well

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,830
here on the on the Left I think on the

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,820
right on your left you can see the

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:03:01,380
circuit that we did so this this time

52
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:05,340
sense it's a crown that reproduces the

53
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:09,310
movement of the earth towards the Sun so

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,160
well not the white Sun towards itself

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,070
and the thing is that it gives different

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,480
points of hot with some resistors

57
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:23,890
depending on where the Sun is so if he

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,950
feels here the heat this means that it's

59
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,220
12:00 in London I hope you understand me

60
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,750
a little bit but yes and so this was a

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,850
problem to elaborate because with

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,520
different with Arduino you don't have

63
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,290
you have too much pins and you have too

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,180
much power too much current so you have

65
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,660
like a lot of current and it's

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,000
impossible to power it up so then we

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,030
decided to work with that a tiny 85 and

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,800
the idea that we had is to use this

69
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:59,709
microcontroller called W as 2811 which

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:04,720
is a shift register and that is used for

71
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:08,230
RGB LEDs okay and we are generating 12

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:14,380
inputs of hot with those resistors using

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:16,659
only their tiny 85 and and what is very

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,570
interesting about this is that Neil

75
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,600
Harrison his idea is that you know that

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,719
Einstein he says if we have eyes as we

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,669
have eyes we can we have time illusions

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,630
no not time illusion sorry optical

79
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,979
illusions okay so if he's if his brain

80
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,210
is able to

81
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,550
connect to feel time instead of the 24

82
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,250
hours/day we have filling time through

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,060
the through his skull he will be able to

84
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,710
have time illusions I don't know if you

85
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,180
understood that because maybe I'm not

86
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,460
explaining myself very good but the

87
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,430
thing is that when he you know that our

88
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,760
brain is very plastic so it can get used

89
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,580
to the new sensors that we are

90
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:04,210
introducing it to our body so the thing

91
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,609
is that when he feels all this heat

92
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,820
going around his head he has this

93
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:14,740
perception of time and if he has lows

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:17,230
down this this rotatory time passing he

95
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,060
thinks that he's gonna be able to slow

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:25,330
his perception of time so to age slower

97
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,710
okay so now you have to sink this then

98
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:33,070
I'm gonna talk about moon Reba's she's a

99
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:37,390
choreographer and dancer and she like at

100
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,150
2007 she got these seismic sensors on

101
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,640
her feet that were connected to

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,190
bluetooth to a mobile phone to some

103
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,349
servers that reproduced the different

104
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,870
seismic movements that are around the

105
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,310
world and she does these performances

106
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:58,210
with a big thumb ball okay we have big

107
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,980
drum and she reproduces all the

108
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,659
earthquakes that have happened for

109
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:07,990
example in Mexico from 1880 till

110
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,150
nowadays but two months ago she decided

111
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,250
to take off these seismic sensors and

112
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,489
what it's very interesting as I said

113
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,290
before our brain is very plastic so for

114
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,200
more than 10 years she had these sensors

115
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,440
so when she took them off her brain was

116
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,870
repeating these movements even so that's

117
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,520
what it's called ghost cyborg because

118
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:33,000
she doesn't have anymore these sensors

119
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:36,010
but she feels the vibrations another

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,780
circuit that we elaborated is the

121
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,750
transcendental communication system it's

122
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:44,169
a Bluetooth tools both near Harbison and

123
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,449
moon' Reba's they included a Bluetooth

124
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,270
enabled buton button

125
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:55,059
I mean vibrate vibrator so they could

126
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:58,058
talk via Morse code by pressing their

127
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:59,860
teeth right now they took it off so

128
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:04,150
they're not wearing it anymore but they

129
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:08,199
used it for some years then later on

130
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,388
after 2017 some more people got inside

131
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,719
the project and we changed the name and

132
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:16,150
we call it transmission Society well

133
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:18,909
it's just it's the same but just another

134
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,849
name so I'm just gonna pass fast here in

135
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:25,330
your right you can see man Elmo knows

136
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,819
which is another cyber artist man Elmo

137
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,779
knows he has a parametric sense that it

138
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:36,360
sends pressure temperature and humidity

139
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:39,219
first of all this circuit used to make

140
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,490
vibrations in his skull so the thing is

141
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:44,919
you have this circuit knob which sensors

142
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,559
humidity pressure and temperature and

143
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,698
depending on the levels of these three

144
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:54,490
parameters he would feel some vibrations

145
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,399
stronger or slow our our software

146
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,139
vibrations but nowadays we changed this

147
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:04,659
circuit and the input that he is

148
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:06,999
receiving is is a bone conduction sun

149
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,520
wave so here has this flash memory

150
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:12,669
inside the circuit which reproduces

151
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,399
bubble sounds and depending on if it's

152
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:18,008
more pressure or if it's more humid he

153
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:25,240
will feel more more bubbles a different

154
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:28,089
type of bubble and so nowadays this year

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,509
2019 we created the cyber foundation

156
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,958
labs which is like a new emerging for us

157
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:37,930
and we are centered we are based in

158
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,468
Barcelona and we give voice to non human

159
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,899
and identities we are a group of

160
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,389
technicians philosophers designers and

161
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,339
artists as I already said that we

162
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:54,279
explore the relationship between species

163
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:56,769
and also how we can involve humans as

164
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,860
you see we base our experimentation or

165
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,279
natural unnatural because humans we have

166
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,680
five

167
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,199
senses not but depending on how you

168
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,378
check it we have five six seven it

169
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:10,258
depends but the idea is that we looked

170
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:12,819
through nature through all the beings

171
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,959
because they have some senses that we

172
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:22,779
don't and this helps us a lot to

173
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:25,300
innovate this till now I've only talked

174
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,829
about artists I don't consider myself an

175
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,729
artist I consider myself a technician

176
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:34,620
and I I am from the crowd of technicians

177
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,879
no well technicians are the core of the

178
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,189
Association and we are the ones to

179
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,610
create all these ideas that artists have

180
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:45,040
or that we by ourselves have then we

181
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,160
have philosophers who are the ones that

182
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,170
generate the cybox theory and some

183
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,009
designers that are the ones that take

184
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,229
care of the materials here I am I just

185
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,449
wrote some because I don't want to only

186
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,430
talk about artists so I just put

187
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:03,719
technicians here Phoenix Bernardo he's

188
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:08,290
the main technician and he's a great

189
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,970
developer and he is the one to generate

190
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,459
all these new circuits that we have to

191
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:15,819
generate because all these new circuits

192
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:19,420
are not created yet they we invent them

193
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:23,589
using the materials and the circuits

194
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:28,389
that we have on in a commercial view we

195
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:31,029
apply it to our domain and we build them

196
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,730
and improve them well we also have Judy

197
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,589
Perez who is a designer but she's also a

198
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,870
technician and myself and I don't have a

199
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:39,699
website so I didn't put my website the

200
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,250
philosopher touch enough another Lopez

201
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,929
and a designer or a Alva there are many

202
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,429
many more people collaborating with us

203
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,620
but I didn't have time to put them all

204
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:50,459
they they are they didn't connect me so

205
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,259
nevermind okay now I'm gonna talk about

206
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:58,479
cosmic rays organ this organ is a an

207
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,699
organ that helps you to detect the

208
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,410
cosmic rays that travel around the

209
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:08,439
atmosphere cosmic rays are these

210
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,620
particles they crash onto the atmosphere

211
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:15,120
and

212
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:19,080
they and also two Mons and the thing is

213
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,510
that we used a project from the MIT that

214
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,920
they designed which I don't know if

215
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,510
there's someone here from the MIT but

216
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,750
there were a lot of errors in the

217
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:33,270
circuit but we are using this circuit

218
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:35,600
from the MIT where they detect these the

219
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:39,300
cosmic rays the thing is that you have

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,890
cell with some oxy oxy oxides I don't

221
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,380
know how you say it inside a dark

222
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,230
chamber with a scintillator

223
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,810
okay which is a type of polymer and this

224
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,810
helps you to it it bounces these

225
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,180
particles bounce and they reduce the

226
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,599
speed of the muons so that we can detect

227
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,420
them

228
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,360
so we detect these moans and we give an

229
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,510
input to to the person that has this

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,330
sense and in this case we did the same

231
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,490
as the pressure as the bottom as the

232
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:14,360
pressure sense where this person is

233
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:18,510
gonna hear frequencies and sounds and

234
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,110
right now we are as I said before

235
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,350
presenting myself here we are developing

236
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,240
a new way because one of the most

237
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,480
problems that we have with our sensors

238
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,300
with our senses sorry is that it's

239
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,360
battery power problems because these new

240
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,569
organs are supposed to to be with you

241
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,630
all your life at least one year now so

242
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,480
what do you do is power it's a big

243
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,330
problem so right now we are just

244
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,270
developing I wanted to bring a prototype

245
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,280
here but some materials that we bought

246
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,220
didn't arrive so I was not able to bring

247
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,310
it but we are right now developing this

248
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,830
Seebeck effect it's the first prototype

249
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,869
development ever and I don't know if you

250
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,360
know what Seebeck effect is but it's a

251
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,310
thermoelectric effect and this

252
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,300
thermoelectric effect what it does is

253
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,300
that it it converts temperature

254
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:20,670
difference to voltage and it also and

255
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,890
also vice versa so as you can see here

256
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,670
we have

257
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,949
prototype designed and well the back

258
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,170
view is just the aluminum it's just

259
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,899
about years or whatever then we can see

260
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:36,349
the dissipator the head sink

261
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:38,720
heat sink and the chip basically what

262
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,269
you have is two plates of two different

263
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,440
materials like copper and constantan I

264
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:44,510
don't know how to say it in English but

265
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,450
whatever and the thing is that when they

266
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:51,560
enter in contact with with with your

267
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:53,839
skin between it there is if there is a

268
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,930
difference of temperature it is gonna

269
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,290
generate voltage so to generate voltage

270
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:05,839
the temperature must be at least from

271
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:07,670
nine to eleven Celsius and if the

272
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,190
temperature is the difference of

273
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,069
temperature is lower it will set to even

274
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,490
eight that's why if the temperature is

275
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:20,450
higher we will have a battery so that we

276
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:24,110
can help you can store it and use it

277
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:26,240
when necessary it's still a prototype so

278
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,699
we are still working on it and figuring

279
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,970
out the charge and discharge systems and

280
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:34,160
which I see we can use here you can see

281
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,100
in the top view you can see these are

282
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:46,250
the the plates that will be in contact

283
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:49,130
with the skin and I'm well so laughs to

284
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:52,519
finish I would like to say that our

285
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:55,220
future expectations is to generate a bit

286
00:14:52,519 --> 00:15:00,100
directional connection because as I

287
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:04,390
explain you right now we have the the

288
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:07,399
medium I mean the world so the world

289
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,620
generates some inputs now and these

290
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,740
senses that we have they read these

291
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:16,190
inputs and they throw some output that

292
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,949
us as human will read as an input but

293
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,380
these are only only directional

294
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:23,029
connection as you can see there is no

295
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,480
back and forth between the sensor and

296
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:30,110
our self so our expectations are from

297
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,209
this for the future are to to generate

298
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,339
this be directional connection where you

299
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,170
are able to communicate with your organ

300
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:44,149
and the organ is able to

301
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:46,370
communicate with yourself and I'm I'm

302
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:50,690
actually done I don't know if I've been

303
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:53,000
super fast but the thing is that we are

304
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,990
calling for engineers to come work with

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,170
us in Barcelona

306
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,300
we can work also on these stunts and but

307
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,000
we are very interested to collaborate

308
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:08,389
with people with with anyway anyone but

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,649
with technicians it would be better so

310
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:12,440
as you can see you are more than welcome

311
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:18,399
to our lab and our team to experimental

312
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,399
built together and thank you thank you

313
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:31,170
it's been we have plenty of time okay so

314
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,410
please prepare extremely long questions

315
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,939
we have a lot of time as you know we

316
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,680
have this time we only have one

317
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,250
microphone angel so if you have a

318
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,969
question or something to discuss just go

319
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,370
to this gentleman over there and go

320
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,520
speak into the microphone does anyone

321
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:53,610
have a question yet we are also open to

322
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:59,010
receive people that want to get some new

323
00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:02,520
census and yeah we can talk later then

324
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,020
all right we have a question does anyone

325
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,030
hug thank you

326
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,650
hello I'm over here we're okay thank you

327
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,780
for the talk I was really interested in

328
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,010
your Seebeck effect prototype so one of

329
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,199
the problems I've been having is

330
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,400
generating power or having a battery

331
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,370
inside the body

332
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,579
so for implantable devices how have you

333
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,989
done any research into powering those

334
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,139
yes actually we have some implanted

335
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,690
devices inside and for now the battery

336
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:35,760
stays outside we have an implanted yet

337
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:39,090
in this case all right

338
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,250
any more questions from anyone okay

339
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,250
maybe one question from me for to do the

340
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,410
Seebeck effect stuff how large do you

341
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,590
need a temperature gradient to be that

342
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:52,470
from 9 to 11 degrees okay so not for

343
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,320
camp use ah so it's not usable at camp

344
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,270
where it's super it depends on your body

345
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,919
temperature it depends on the difference

346
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,410
of the of the body temperature and the

347
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,890
temperature of the any of the outside

348
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,770
okay but the idea is to generate a

349
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,380
system that as a house now when you have

350
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,180
the solar with your solar panels you

351
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,980
generate a system where when there is no

352
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,740
Sun you still have your batteries

353
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,590
working on because you're stored it so

354
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,940
that that would be the idea yes how

355
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,409
large was the device that you showed

356
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:27,300
actually I don't know because we my

357
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,870
friend was the one who designed these um

358
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:33,360
the match the prototype so I'm not sure

359
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,419
actually I don't think I'm not sure I

360
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,250
cannot tell you anything

361
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,290
can let you know all right we have a

362
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,540
question from the audience yeah could

363
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,710
you speak more to how the current

364
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:47,210
cyborgs who use powered devices are

365
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,790
dealing with batteries and dealing with

366
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:53,060
charging to make it as seamless a part

367
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,850
of their lives as possible without these

368
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,320
devices that you're currently developing

369
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,909
so right now we are working with a tiny

370
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:04,520
so what tiny has a really really low

371
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:06,380
current consumption so I I don't have

372
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,200
any sense installed in me so I'm not

373
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,480
able to speak for them I would need to

374
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,640
ask them what how they work how do they

375
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,100
do it but actually we only take off our

376
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,900
the battery and put it back again and

377
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:22,300
that's what I'm saying that we are like

378
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,740
looking for very low consumption icees

379
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:30,889
microcontrollers so right now with your

380
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:32,660
tiny we are working fine okay just one

381
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,400
second if we if someone in the room

382
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,620
wants to be a signal angel for this talk

383
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,300
please just maybe talk to the stage

384
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,860
manager in the back and then we can also

385
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,500
receive questions from the internet

386
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,629
which would be very cool thank you now

387
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:51,440
please hey thanks again for this great

388
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:53,840
note um I was curious about two aspects

389
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,080
that are a bit boring one is how do you

390
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,860
fund your work oh yes yeah that's the

391
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:04,540
part I didn't that I didn't add so right

392
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:08,810
now we are trying to to see a way to

393
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:12,350
finance ourselves right now none of us

394
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,620
are receiving any money it's all because

395
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,719
we love it as I said we have a little

396
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,850
bit of problems between artists and

397
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,860
technicians actually I wanted to bring

398
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,230
some devices here but all the artists

399
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,990
were like no no no I'm sorry no I'm

400
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,360
keeping it it's too risky and I'm like

401
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,270
what we developed it for you and you

402
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,820
don't let me bring it here no but the

403
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:39,010
thing is that so right now we are

404
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:41,929
starting to on September because the

405
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,610
laboratory emerged this year I mean I

406
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,010
explained some years ago they were

407
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,530
working but they were more artistic and

408
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,100
more their selves they go to talks by

409
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,590
themselves

410
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,909
because they are known but right now

411
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,809
there is emerging

412
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,549
we are emerging as collective as

413
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:00,610
technician designers and philosophers

414
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,559
and we are looking ways of renunciation

415
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,770
some some ways of financiación would be

416
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,960
the no return financiación no so we are

417
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,549
developing these documents to send to

418
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,340
different enterprises that would be

419
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,660
interested in our project and then they

420
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,939
would give us some finance situation

421
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,600
with no return but we are also planning

422
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:24,140
to do some workshops and some open some

423
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,059
parties in our bunker we call it so that

424
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,299
we can finance she ate all this because

425
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:32,510
we have a kind of problem between the

426
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:36,408
Seibert the artists that the people that

427
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:40,158
wants to get some new sensors because we

428
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:43,100
don't make them pay at all at all so we

429
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:47,000
are like working like crazy and giving

430
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,918
the work to other people and we are not

431
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,179
getting anything in our laboratory I

432
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,270
don't know if you are getting me sorry

433
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,370
my English but the thing is that that's

434
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,190
what I the last thing I talked with my

435
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,830
colleagues was ok no more sense for

436
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,480
anyone we will build senses for us just

437
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,520
some prototypes to have them here if

438
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,500
they want them in a commercial way

439
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,650
they're gonna have to pay for it for it

440
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:13,940
now ok so in this case we are totally

441
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:16,700
open distribution schematics everything

442
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,380
it's totally open but if you're gonna

443
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,840
use it in a commercial way then yes

444
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,460
you're gonna have to pay for the rights

445
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,260
I don't know if I know so that leads to

446
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,950
my second question which is somehow

447
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,470
related I started working on an

448
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,030
electronic implant a few years ago with

449
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,799
body modification artists called Samba

450
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:42,289
van cyborgs you might know anyway and my

451
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:45,260
approach was to go through academia so

452
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:48,260
we started trying to get some ethical

453
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,470
approval from the academic world which

454
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:55,158
is almost impossible are you do you have

455
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:59,410
any constraints on certification and

456
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:01,840
this kind of ok so I think this is my my

457
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:06,310
and weak point because I'm not sure

458
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,860
about it but what I do know is that as I

459
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,260
said I don't like to consider myself an

460
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,080
artist but what happens with art is that

461
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,600
everything fits there so that's why all

462
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,389
my colleagues that are with some senses

463
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,060
and they consider themselves artists IRA

464
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,670
side works they call themselves artists

465
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,230
because everything fits in art so people

466
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,830
will not question yourself if you say

467
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,460
it's art what I do know is that Neil

468
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,919
Harrison had some trouble with police

469
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:40,000
they were he wanted to cross the

470
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,550
passport Airport and they well he had

471
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,710
two problems one was in the airport with

472
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,800
his antenna they were saying that he

473
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,930
could not cross it because in his

474
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,050
picture was without antenna and he had

475
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:56,440
the antenna and finally and he started a

476
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,810
bureaucratic situation where they

477
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,930
finally recognized him as the first

478
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:06,790
cyborg so he could pass and cross the

479
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:09,160
the the 101 and then he also had some

480
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,680
problems with police where they broke

481
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,940
his he had some troubles in Barcelona I

482
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,220
don't know if he was drinking on the

483
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,430
street or whatever and they started they

484
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,220
hit him and they broke his antenna and

485
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:23,020
but about bureaucratic stuff I think we

486
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,020
should have here my colleagues to talk

487
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:30,670
about it I mean because I'm I'm not into

488
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:32,800
that I'm into electronics thank you ok I

489
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,340
think we found a signal angel so if you

490
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:40,810
under stream you might be able to okay

491
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,000
no the answer's no all right first of

492
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:46,480
all thank you for your soul kiss was

493
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,110
super clear I'm wondering usually we

494
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:54,350
when we want to sleep well at night we

495
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:56,939
should the light we have no sound

496
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,779
pretty not too warm the tickled

497
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,899
remittitur

498
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:05,009
so you know if these people all cyborgs

499
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:07,139
are ever like you quiet smooth for the

500
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:09,600
sensors or just turn dinner for

501
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,340
something because you cannot really

502
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,350
control like cosmic rays for example

503
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,139
that's a good question I think each

504
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,879
person would do whatever they feel like

505
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,490
but what I'd know that they don't do is

506
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:22,379
take it off because they are too

507
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,679
concentrated I mean they are to focus on

508
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:29,340
on that but for example near Harrison he

509
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:32,190
has his antenna is connected to he

510
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,158
connect it he gave permission to three

511
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:39,389
friends of them around the world to send

512
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,570
him colors so that whenever he sleeps he

513
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:44,998
dreams with those colors with these

514
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,519
frequencies you have to think of these

515
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,110
devices as your own organ so whenever

516
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,200
you are sleeping and suddenly you open

517
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,119
your eyes um you're still sleeping some

518
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,769
people would I don't know maybe some

519
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,189
people would sleep with with all the

520
00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:01,080
whites our but your ears you're not able

521
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:05,490
to close them either whether you put

522
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:09,689
some plugs so these organ works the same

523
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:11,610
I mean is part of your body so whether

524
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:16,740
you are sleeping whether you are awake

525
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:20,039
the organ is functioning so and yes as I

526
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,970
said the brain is very plastic the brain

527
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,070
is like a sculpture

528
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:27,419
you can modulate and do whatever you

529
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:29,519
want so um after some months maybe six

530
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,950
months maybe one year your brain gaze

531
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,230
gets super used to it to this to these

532
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,999
new sense that you have and you don't

533
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,299
even feel it anymore you don't even feel

534
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:38,369
it

535
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:40,230
not yours you it's totally yours

536
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:43,110
actually if they take it off you're

537
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,029
totally like up no and yeah when

538
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,490
as I said when you sleep your ears are

539
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:49,769
still on you're not able to turn them

540
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:58,220
off so that would be the same with the

541
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:58,220
organ alright any other questions

542
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,220
if anything else you want to show well I

543
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,290
would want to say well there is a video

544
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,640
but it is stupid video so no so but

545
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,980
thank you very much for listening and

546
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,320
