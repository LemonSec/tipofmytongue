6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,910
a little bit of the fire pit here

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,910
because I didn't had enough fire on time

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:45,059

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,898
actually yes yeah it was an absolute

10
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,108
awesome event for me I had a great time

11
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,379
running around seeing all the stuff what

12
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:58,469
all the people bring here all the things

13
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,829
which were happening here like I didn't

14
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,019
had no time to see anything my

15
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,250
experience is more like oh wow here's

16
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,650
something here's something here's

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,860
something it's like it's it's the day

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,399
two and a half or so sorry

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,640
apparently it's like day to day two and

20
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,640
a half

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,750
yeah it's not maybe not long enough

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,540
maybe I'm not I need some clones of

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:33,060
myself something like that because all

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:37,630
the workshops projects all the sessions

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,670
talks um we had a full pack far plan up

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,910
for plan the launch it was amazing who

27
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,780
wasn't have launched by the way it's

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:49,000
quite a few hands okay okay who had

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,560
about the trick that in cold nights you

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,830
go into the launch to warm up more hands

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,650
yes because that's the what that was the

32
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,869
best way to stay warm in the night it's

33
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,910
really really cold it was really cold

34
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,320
but then it got warmer but now it's

35
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,770
really well

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:12,880
flick nothing in between it was cold and

37
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,500
then it was just hot so the sweet spot

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,549
was like 20 minutes in the morning

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,590
before you just fell out of your tent

40
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,660
yeah and then you run around and see all

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,610
the things and think like okay I need to

42
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,180
do this I need to do that I need to do

43
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,280
this I drove with the train I drove for

44
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,090
the Train you drop the train no not the

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,030
train with the Train okay yes heck us on

46
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,700
a train pick us on the train yeah I mean

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,780
if you if you run around here on this

48
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:47,320
huge area and we had like 230 villages

49
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:50,459
something like that and every single

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,400
village was bringing a shitload of stuff

51
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,880
kitchens and kitchens incredible nice

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,750
meals I hope you had some of that yes

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:06,340
yeah and they also brought pools

54
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:14,880
oh did does anyone know how many pools

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:14,880
we have on Camp Penn 10 10 or something

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,930
yes okay so there were multiple pools

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,359
some of them hate it I was just for

58
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,580
shorts shorts jump in one of the lakes

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,650
he had about that heated pool maybe that

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,320
was also a good choice if you one was a

61
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,580
brand not in the launch jumping a heated

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,440
pool in the summer yeah maybe in that

63
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:44,730
cold night probably probably so I mean

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,180
if you run around and see all that I was

65
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,519
heavily amazed by this community it's

66
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,340
always it's always wonderful to see how

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,910
people do stuff together like the

68
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:03,480
village is helping each other out and

69
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:06,220
new projects just emerging and new yeah

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,920
cooperatives coming out of that camp

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,810
from people who just met up because the

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,780
tents were close together or something

73
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,110
it was really really wonderful to see

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,630
that growing absolutely on the other

75
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,880
hand there comes some old helpful

76
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,110
friends about you here probably that

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,820
cows eat the cows on the east cause for

78
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:34,910
sending care package to cows west

79
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,909
[Laughter]

80
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:44,169
special kind of and all this all this

81
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,870
volunteers I mean I do a little bit of

82
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,900
organization here but I every time on

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,970
every event you met new people who doing

84
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,400
crazy stuff and all our organization

85
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:59,170
teams getting bigger and bigger and

86
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,909
every single human is working on a part

87
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,710
and making this event happen and I think

88
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,710
this is worth a big applause for all

89
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:20,520
and all the angels you saw probably all

90
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,350
the numbers in the infrastructure review

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,150
and if you didn't saw them you maybe

92
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,340
want to watch the infrastructure review

93
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,929
afterwards because it's like impressive

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,409
yes and you can still get into helping

95
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,889
out for teardown but we're not yet there

96
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,410
no absolutely not because one of the

97
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:44,880
things on this camp and also on other

98
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,009
events on this else's style is I'm very

99
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,020
fascinated about everybody has a

100
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,720
different experience on that I mean we

101
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,570
all work in some teams or angel Anor

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,949
just presenting our own projects or

103
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:05,250
stuff like that so everybody sees with

104
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:08,699
different eyes this events so it's quite

105
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:13,979
a little bit of a different camp for

106
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:17,760
everyone here so each of us experience

107
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,969
the same event but different so we can

108
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,080
talk about the camp and we'll have like

109
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:27,300
5,000 different stories 5,000 different

110
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,240
adventures right there's different

111
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,430
wonderful ideas that came up and more

112
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,110
absolutely I mean one of one of my

113
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:41,180
personal favorite experience was the

114
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,180
chunk desert on day 2 did you hit some

115
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:52,710
okay but it was nice and creamy yeah for

116
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,849
sure yeah and it's very good for bribing

117
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,250
people yes by the way by the way when

118
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:01,409
one guy tried to bribe me yesterday to

119
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,229
make some advertisement for his new

120
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:08,039
business field half not this but I

121
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:12,090
forgot the sticker oh come on

122
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:16,169
but I didn't say anything so hmm I only

123
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:18,250
found hackers for future da-te okay you

124
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,620
got some coffee for that or

125
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,360
actually not I just found this sticker

126
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,570
and I think hackers for future is a

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,490
pretty cool idea so since we have

128
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,860
Friday's for future scientists for

129
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:43,530
future parents for future hackers for

130
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:46,680
future come on bring more solar power

131
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,419
absolutely I mean if you see what our

132
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,420
groups here weigh on all that reusable

133
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,250
straws reusable strong who has one with

134
00:07:52,420 --> 00:08:00,180
him

135
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,180
where's one usable straw nobody nobody

136
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:08,400
5,000 people can interested okay fine so

137
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,070
you better we're visiting one of these

138
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,690
sustainability groups there were very

139
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:19,000
nice discussions and about freedom and

140
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,950
also like you probably saw the Salar

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,410
Heinz at slighting they had a truck on

142
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:29,469
center with some solar panels on top and

143
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:34,479
we're charging your phones for free that

144
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:38,320
was pretty cool but it's not everything

145
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,830
was connected to the solar power we all

146
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,740
had or we had a lot of blinking stuff

147
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,440
everywhere so the whole camp was

148
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,410
gleaming at night and it was so pretty

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,520
with the fairy dust and the palm tree

150
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:56,170
and the unicorn called Olga absolutely

151
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,960
oh my god

152
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,349
oh yeah okay I think she'll come to

153
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,350
Congress yeah so this was really

154
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,040
wonderful if it's fireproof b1 we need

155
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,150
to check it

156
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,150
we'll check about that

157
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,959
probably with with the hexan higher

158
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:21,170
maybe yeah it'd be one I know the first

159
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,579
be one fireproof fire fire pit in the

160
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,120
world

161
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,180
[Laughter]

162
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,730
yeah the bling stuff there were one very

163
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,269
specific position when you came from the

164
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:41,690
from the Flippa area who was playing

165
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:44,149
flipper and casino lots of nice when you

166
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,370

208
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,829

one guy had an RFID reader with him and

210
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:28,149

155 single RFID tags in 10 minutes and

214
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,540

the third one was the anger exchange

227
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,370
point yeah exchange point yes I think

228
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,559
the the ink exchange point and the one

229
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,160
the pervy bar they brought all their

230
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:44,949
complaints to the sides and and when you

231
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,249
put your complaint form at the sides I'm

232
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,189
in that in that box there was a shredder

233
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:56,060
inside

234
00:13:50,189 --> 00:14:06,410
and procedure the result is there

235
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:11,729
[Applause]

236

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:25,439
that maybe try to bribe them

239
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:29,279

240
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,920
bribe the sights and and they put a 5

241
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:37,860

244
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:49,740

245
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,080
getting all these complaints okay

246
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,080
[Laughter]

247
00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:02,520
but I think the best part of camp or

248
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:05,220
what I heard from many people apart from

249
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,970
all the projects and all the cool stuff

250
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,780
that people brought it's that camp got

251
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:15,300
much more diverse and much more

252
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,589
political and that was a pretty good

253
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,620
thing in all the feedback we collected

254
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,460
before this talk so a big thank you to

255
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,340
all the ones who brought political

256
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:32,190
projects who made ecological talks and

257
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,550
workshops at the at the three-headed

258
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:39,360
monkey at the about freedom cluster over

259
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:43,620
there it was pretty cool to see how the

260
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,800
community developed their own voice and

261
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,650
getting louder again and this is I think

262
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,829
a really really cool thing thank you for

263
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,829
them

264
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:08,080
yeah there's some there was often a big

265
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:12,780
discussion about if the CCC is political

266
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,640
yes it is but it's not party political

267
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,520
so we have a political interest also you

268
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,750
can see probably with our escape routes

269
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,640
have to be free and human rights and

270
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,100
also kind of the ante for flag outside

271
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:34,210

272
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:37,210

273
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:40,330
who were able to climb up there if not

274
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,190

circumstances before the investigation

321
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,370
seemed to be founded on two things

322
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,320
my friendship with Julian Assange and

323
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:39,090
the fact that I have many pieces of

324
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,830
technology in my possession during 130

325
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,168
days of investigation

326
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,559

evidence have been found last week a

328
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,899
picture was circulated that was claimed

329
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:53,970
to be irrefutable proof that I had

330
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,679
entered the computer systems of the

331
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,460
Ecuadorian telephone and network

332
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,100
provider CNT the picture in fact showed

333
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,440
the opposite that I never entered not

334
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,580
tried to enter and that I sent the

335
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,750
picture to try to get the hole fixed

336
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,230
there are many dangers facing

337
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,330
technologies these days the fundamental

338
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,630
lack of understanding how computers work

339
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,730
is a big part of this but also the

340
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,760
persecution of people that work on

341
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,880
digital human rights we all need to

342
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,710
continue pushing forward not allowing

343
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,250
these kinds of attacks against our

344
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,620
community to continue Ecuador and my

345
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,039
case is more extreme than in many other

346
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:40,590
places but I will set a precedent that

347
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:43,860
other countries will use if we let them

348
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:47,070
I wish I was there having this

349
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,870
conversation with you in person I wish I

350
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,770
could come to Congress in four months

351
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,350
and see you

352
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,290
but it's very unlikely Ecuador will let

353
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:58,699
me go so I send you my greetings from

354
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,700
here continue the fight

355
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,949
it's it's crucial for us in our

356
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,290
community to take care about each other

357
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,360
and there are enough people who get in

358
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,430
real trouble because they just found out

359
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,709
some security holes and try to get in

360
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:38,790
contact with manufacturers or

361
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,310
governments if you want to help all a

362
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,320
beanie just try to read for the case

363
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,649
that you can make your own picture of it

364
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,590
and you can treat it about that was a

365
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,720
hashtag free or a beanie of follow they

366
00:21:49,590 --> 00:22:05,159
account free ola beanie i invite you to

367
00:21:51,720 --> 00:22:10,200
do that you know there are many people

368
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:15,330
here doing their political work or doing

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:21,170
their part in whatever project came out

370
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:25,830
of to vote and other big movements that

371
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:28,200
yes bring from our community one of

372
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:33,889
those people i met yesterday in the

373
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:37,920
evening and told me here at camp i

374
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:42,300
finally collected enough energy so it

375
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:46,770
can work on all our projects again from

376
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:50,129
tomorrow on and i hope this is for every

377
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:55,050
one of you like at least a little part

378
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:58,770
true that you can take whatever ya use

379
00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:03,680
you experienced here you part of the

380
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:07,680
camp take it home have it inside you and

381
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:10,290
feed from it for the next month for the

382
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:15,360
next CCC events where we come together

383
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:18,030
again so I'm sorry I'm also always

384
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,610
emotional at closing events I don't know

385
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:26,370
why I said yes to actually sit here and

386
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:28,949
not there maybe it helps this time okay

387
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,500
yeah yeah the thing is always where

388
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,080
there is a saying that you have the post

389
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,870
Congress syndrome

390
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,720
some people know it's when you get back

391
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:43,310
into this normal world with our all-day

392
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,679
problems without any Wiggins with the

393
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:50,040
reckless respectless people running

394
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:55,320
around which are like probably minimized

395
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,629
or not even here which is yeah minimize

396
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,990
minimize there are 5,000 people you

397
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:04,080
always have some not so excellent people

398
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:08,990
yeah but probably that can work on it

399
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:15,409
and you be more excellent the next time

400
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:15,410
not spraying graffitis on rent attend

401
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,590
honestly whoever this was might want to

402
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:44,279
take a step back and think about his

403
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:48,070
life hacking on this card i Oso

404
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:50,289
maximized me or the better me probably

405
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,240
maybe someone wants to write an app for

406
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,590
that

407
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,860
to get bet on that yeah don't don't

408
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:02,080
don't spray on tans vibrating a lot

409
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:04,360
every night before you get drunken so

410
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,369
man that much time to get on the on the

411
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,449
bed just like a little bit in between

412
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:14,939
but it looks like really amazing you got

413
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:17,379
it actually showing the right time yes

414
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,610
okay I didn't manage that one

415
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:23,110
yeah don't reset it at the moment I'm

416
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,059
pretty sure they will work on that

417
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,330
because the rest won't surprisingly

418
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:31,509
smooth so even if they're not so much

419
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:34,720
even in this computer stuff

420
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:38,740
this device is definitely one very great

421
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:42,340
entrance into this smart device smart

422
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,169
home and also like metering yourself big

423
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,350
applause for the karaoke because it's

424
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,350
all

425
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:07,100
you know I'm quite out of my notes here

426
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:12,110
one more you have one yes I have one

427
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:17,320
more I'll get in touch with computers

428
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:19,879
like mid-90s and playing monkey islands

429
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,139
once was really one of my favorite

430
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,450
things and you probably saw that crazy

431
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,420
pirate ship at this reheated monkey

432
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,060
village and also like the whole seeming

433
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,410
and it was one hidden gem

434
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:39,200
you saw this boats standing before it

435
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:41,150
some of them had a had a small thing

436
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,920
that you can opened and then playing

437
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:53,510
Monkey Island I didn't see I lost some

438
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:57,260
time yes so many wonderful proteins so

439
00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:00,140
much glamour is so much blinking

440
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:04,310
everywhere I think we could go on for

441
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:06,020
like 40 hours to tell you about all the

442
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,840
cool things and we couldn't do all of

443
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,480
that because we didn't see and not all

444
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,870
of them I think it's totally impossible

445
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,970
to do that don't get irritated I'm

446
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,969
hungry okay John

447
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,189
OKs he has he already I think they need

448
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:34,850
some more time

449
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:38,810
but no where was I

450
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:43,490
all right so many projects we would like

451
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:45,919
like no it's not a silent minute for all

452
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:49,970
of them but a big applause for all the

453
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:54,560
very cool stuff and I hope that we can

454
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:57,110
all probably see most of them at some

455
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:02,120
point on Twitter or at the next Congress

456
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:07,300
or wherever and have a bit more yeah

457
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:10,959
more CCC in our lives then hopefully oh

458
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,340
nice yeah I'm sitting outside EPS

459
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,240
firepits often so I know how to handle

460
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,899
this for the easy way

461
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,000
yeah you fixed it back there yeah but I

462
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,310
usually don't turn them off do you know

463
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,710
somebody because I think it's time to go

464
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:28,040
to bed now yeah that would be nice

465
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,420
someone should shoot maybe we have to

466
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,399
wish that maybe we have some

467
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:36,320
professionals for that turning off no

468
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,750
professionals here turning off the fire

469
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,970
oh I guess we get some help for that

470
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:46,940
this is pretty nice thank you very much

471
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:51,610
