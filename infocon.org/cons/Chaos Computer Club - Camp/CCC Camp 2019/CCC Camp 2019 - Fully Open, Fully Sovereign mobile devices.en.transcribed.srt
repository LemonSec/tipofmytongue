1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:20,369
I talk about sovereign mobile devices

2
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,979
our speaker is Paul from Australia who

3
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,380
is both the creator of the m65 retro

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,020
computer and the several mesh networking

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,600
mesh network telephone system and this

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,030
project is basically combining these two

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:48,530
into one amazing device please give him

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:51,480
a warm round of applause thanks today

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,159
well let's start with an apology I had

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,099
intended to give this talk actually

11
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,659
using the 8-bit mobile phone that we're

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,429
making unfortunately the VGA connector

13
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,670
is is wonky so we're having to fall back

14
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,320
to the the old fashioned solution here

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,930
but if you want to there was a video

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,970
that I made in New Zealand in January at

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,130
LCA and we got the entire presentation

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,679
there using a different one of these

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,000
prototypes so yeah have a look at that

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,280
if you want to were to see it in action

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,619
making phone calls and the whole kit or

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,149
come and grab us and we can have a play

23
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,030
with the one here and maybe even get

24
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:28,200
this one working in a nice way for folks

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:33,329
as well I just thought about to start

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,860
with this picture of horror really I'm

27
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,029
an Australian I live in Australia and

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,180
someone thought it would be a good idea

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,030
to put Vegemite into Brett sores clearly

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,460
this is a bad idea but it just struck me

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,920
as embodying in many ways the whole

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,658
problem of what is you know the issues

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,939
we have around proprietary hardware and

34
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,630
the loss of sovereignty of our digital

35
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,369
devices we should be able to buy a

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,298
bretzel that doesn't have Vegemite in it

37
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,000
if we want one that doesn't have

38
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,969
Vegemite in it and just gets to the

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,280
heart of the whole issue so what I

40
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,649
really want to go through today in many

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,600
ways it's it's more on the philosophical

42
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,610
side but using what we're doing is a

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,019
practical example around that and it is

44
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,690
really around this issue of digital

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,510
sovereignty and how we can make mobile

46
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,620
devices that are truly digitally

47
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,440
sovereign in a way that no other mobile

48
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,550
devices are

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,780
that actually still useful to use and in

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,130
that there are these questions around

51
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,690
how we can make devices that are

52
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,190
actually maintainable because it's the

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,410
maintenance of capability that's

54
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,090
actually harder in many ways than the

55
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,060
creation of capability in this

56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,640
particular space and then as we start

57
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,140
thinking about different radio types and

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,510
things that we can make devices that are

59
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,100
independent of infrastructure

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,620
independent of energy we need to think

61
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,530
about how we can handle complex

62
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,450
untrustable devices in a way that makes

63
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,720
them still maintainable as a capability

64
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,239
to use and then you know finishing

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,820
around how we can make new interesting

66
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,680
mobile devices that have not really been

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,040
possible to do and to do that with much

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,210
fewer resources than it currently takes

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,950
and then having a look at the very end

70
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,430
about how we can do that with radio so

71
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,869
my goal is will be finished me talking

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,670
in the next 25 minutes or so and have

73
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,060
plenty of time for questions but we'll

74
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,429
take it

75
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:28,690
fairly flexibly so what do we mean by

76
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,400
Digital sovereignty and my thinking

77
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,579
around this has really been around what

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,160
do we think about a sovereignty for

79
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,470
normal in a normal kind of way of life

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,299
so this really is actually that people

81
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,180
should be able to create modify but the

82
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,390
things we understand from the GPL ought

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,739
to apply in practice to the devices the

84
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,250
software systems and things that we're

85
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,750
using and this means as we know you know

86
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,580
innovating without permission

87
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,550
changing the purpose making something

88
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,560
useful in a new and different way and

89
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,280
also should be able to sustain

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,110
capability and this is a thing that I

91
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,630
will keep coming back to that we need to

92
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,530
be able to not just make something but

93
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,750
actually be able to makes it and they

94
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,760
can be maintained in the long term for

95
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,769
it to actually be practical and useful

96
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,750
and so you know I took a look at what

97
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,649
the Wikipedia definition is for

98
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,839
sovereignty and is this really

99
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:23,169
interesting point it's hinging around

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,760
the full right and power of something to

101
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,580
do things itself so if we think about in

102
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,159
the digital world it's our full right

103
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,930
and power to be able to have a digital

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
artifact and do what we want to it

105
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,490
without any interference without any

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,830
hindrance from any outside sources or

107
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,800
body

108
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,859
and so she makes this really interesting

109
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,169
point that the right to modify the GPO

110
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,030
gives us the right to modify so we can

111
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,590
modify the Android open source software

112
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,198
project or in various other things that

113
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,239
are under open source licenses with the

114
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,740
GPL or other ones but that doesn't mean

115
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,560
that we necessarily have the power to do

116
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,110
that that it may require so many you

117
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,580
know person months of effort to even

118
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,259
just get the thing to compile let alone

119
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,090
to actually understand how it works

120
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,090
enough that we can use it for a

121
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,330
different purpose and so that the

122
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,650
practical effect of this is a digital

123
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,568
sovereignty and I think we're all

124
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,000
probably fairly conscious of this lags

125
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:20,150
behind physical sovereignty in a fairly

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,500
significant way so if we compare just a

127
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,479
conventional bucket that you would used

128
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,270
to carry water or whatever and a

129
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,610
smartphone we actually find that our

130
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,669
freedom our sovereignty over these

131
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,280
devices is wildly different so with a

132
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,318
bucket you know we can use it until it

133
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,299
breaks right we can carry water it

134
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,400
doesn't need updates the vendor can't

135
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,919
make that bucket retrospectively no

136
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,008
longer useful but with smartphones we

137
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:49,340
see these kind of issues it's much

138
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:51,860
easier to make a bucket by yourself than

139
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,799
it is to make a smartphone by yourself

140
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,469
so the power to make a sovereign's

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,419
smartphone is greatly diminished for us

142
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,650
and of course we can repurpose a bucket

143
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,940
to do whatever we want you know whether

144
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,120
that is using it as a helmet with eye

145
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,889
holes or to carry cheese instead of

146
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,060
water it doesn't matter we can use these

147
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,400
things as we want

148
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,650
whereas with mobile phones we find

149
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,068
ourselves to varying degrees trapped in

150
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,049
sand boxes it's particularly critical as

151
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,759
we know on the the iOS devices but even

152
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,930
on Android you know you need to route

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,150
the phone to be able to do certain

154
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,099
things and there's a complexity in there

155
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,679
that actually again diminishes our power

156
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:29,779
to be able to do that and then likewise

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,810
to be able to innovate to make a better

158
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:33,979
phone or a better bucket this is worlds

159
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:40,279
apart in terms of what we're actually

160
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:43,430
able to do so this hasn't always been

161
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:46,250
the case that in the early days of

162
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,719
computers they were largely digitally

163
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,790
sovereign so if you bought a Commodore

164
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:51,620
64 and 1982

165
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,180
the documentation as she told you how to

166
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,860
do a bunch of things you could buy books

167
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,950
that had a disassembly of the entire

168
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,180
operating system and you know commodore

169
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,650
didn't sell anyone for doing that

170
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,330
because they knew that it would sell

171
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,390
more units if people could do more

172
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,300
things with the computer now of course

173
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,650
things have changed quite a lot that

174
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,420
partly the growing digital economy and

175
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,060
these concentrations of power that

176
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,650
that's created that these large company

177
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,020
said well you know what we can make more

178
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,700
money if we actually control the way

179
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,570
people use things and that invariably

180
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,039
means also restricting what they can do

181
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,130
unless you just the sheer complexity of

182
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,070
the devices makes it hard for us to

183
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,990
actually be sovereign over them again

184
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,420
you know in theory you know I've got a

185
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,150
fair phone too so it has an open-source

186
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,370
operating system version available for

187
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,560
that and I could hack on that and indeed

188
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,390
I can if I want to but the effort

189
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,880
required to do that is actually

190
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,090
tremendous the learning curve required

191
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,130
is tremendous for most people that's a

192
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,210
power they simply cannot in practice

193
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,370
exercise and so this is a problem and

194
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,810
then we have the related issue around

195
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,430
planned obsolescence that you know

196
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,960
companies want to sell a new stuff so

197
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,120
they don't care about maintaining old

198
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,739
product why would you spend money doing

199
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,690
that when you can be making a new

200
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,550
product and making it so that that's

201
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,820
better and people want to buy it and you

202
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,050
might even go so far as to restrict even

203
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,300
further the ways that people can use the

204
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,850
old device and give various reasons

205
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,220
around that and there is you know this

206
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,750
saying from Microsoft that for them for

207
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,280
many years their greatest competitor was

208
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,890
actually the previous version of their

209
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,140
software and so these behaviors can be

210
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,780
active or passive whether they're trying

211
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,250
to do these things and as I say on the

212
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,348
slide this is very naughty behavior

213
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,809
indeed if we actually want to be able to

214
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:46,430
let people own the things that they have

215
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:49,790
paid for but again I think that actually

216
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,099
is second fiddle to this problem that is

217
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,050
the complexity of modern systems that

218
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,770
really really undermines their

219
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,780
sovereignty or our power of sovereignty

220
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,430
over them that the more complex

221
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,860
something is the harder it is to even

222
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,589
know where to start

223
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,600
to be able to make any changes and so

224
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,220
there's this huge effort required you

225
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,990
know example would take Android again if

226
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,390
I wanted to maintain an improved version

227
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,950
of Android for my fare phone I would

228
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,170
probably need about ten of me working on

229
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,790
it near full time to realistically keep

230
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,540
up with that in any really effective way

231
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,770
and you know this is even worse if I

232
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,930
wanted to actually control the baseband

233
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:30,280
radio in the phone and I can't even get

234
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,109
documentation on that and so you know if

235
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,540
we want to make fully sovereign mobile

236
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,510
devices we need to change the way that

237
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,030
we're doing things and as I've been

238
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,530
reflecting on things and as I said

239
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,569
earlier that we're making this mega 65

240
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,670
retro computer and I'm also leading the

241
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,490
civil project that it occurred to me

242
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,520
that if we can actually get the

243
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:54,880
simplicity of the 1980s home computer

244
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,350
era to be the controlling piece of the

245
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,170
phone we can actually break apart the

246
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,150
complexity and restore the sovereign

247
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,540
power over the device as a whole and

248
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,090
we'll go on more in that and so then

249
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,560
what actually makes it so hard to make a

250
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,030
mobile phone if you want to make fully

251
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,630
sovereign ones we need to understand

252
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,680
what the challenges are the first point

253
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,160
really is actually making something that

254
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,219
is that small and electronic you have

255
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,189
these tiny circuits and it's just it is

256
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,750
simply hard and expensive work to do and

257
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,160
then you know how do you connect the

258
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,210
devices together there is a whole bunch

259
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:35,230
of complexities around how that works

260
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:37,990
but it gets worse the software is

261
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,730
actually really hard to get working if

262
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,170
you make a device you go okay right I

263
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,970
have a new improved phone that has

264
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,819
something that I want on it physically

265
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,650
and now I want to you know support

266
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,020
Android or some other operating system

267
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,829
to it and maintain that this is hard

268
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,970
work and you know I love what fairphone

269
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,260
are doing and I love what purism are

270
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,690
doing and I hope they keep on doing it

271
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,250
and continue to grow in their capability

272
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,230
but I think both of them would

273
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,290
if we were to ask them agree that it is

274
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,270
a lot of work to maintain a port of

275
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,069
Android let alone to add new features in

276
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:13,730
or indeed of a whole mobile operating

277
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:16,040
system whether it's Android or not and

278
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,420
then from an open perspective again if

279
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,180
we want full sovereignty we actually

280
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,949
want to be able to trust the hardware we

281
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,109
want to understand how it works we need

282
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,840
to have a mobile radio that we can

283
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,830
actually trust and use in any in a

284
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,680
sensible way to protect our privacy and

285
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:35,180
this basically is impossible to do and

286
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,739
then the silly little network is the

287
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,109
piece behind that we don't even control

288
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,730
that if we want to have fully sovereign

289
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,930
mobile communications which you need to

290
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,100
be able to replace each of those

291
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:50,599
components and this is no simple task

292
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:53,210
and as basically said already that even

293
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,360
if you can achieve this that maintaining

294
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,860
it actually for a single person is

295
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,010
basically impossible so if we want to

296
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,230
individual sovereignty over our devices

297
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,480
we need to dramatically change the way

298
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,950
that we can that we design and make

299
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,200
these things so that the barriers to

300
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,700
entry are reduced at a determined

301
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,400
individual can say I want a phone that

302
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,570
has some characteristic about it and

303
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,520
actually create that so before we go

304
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,740
further just a quick note as we've

305
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,360
already mentioned the from purism

306
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,860
delivering five and there's a bunch of

307
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,900
others as why phone and things there are

308
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,760
I am so glad to see that there are all

309
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,540
these other projects around open mobile

310
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,700
devices with varying goals and you know

311
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,560
they're different things I love the

312
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,360
diversity that that brings and there are

313
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,160
fresh ideas coming from all of them so I

314
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,940
don't want in any way to discourage

315
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,949
those projects or talk them down on the

316
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,900
contrary we all need to be chipping away

317
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,970
at the castle walls if we actually want

318
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:56,000
to get to the point of freedom again

319
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:59,240
with this so started thinking how can we

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,170
do this and I thought well let's

321
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,020
actually turn the whole planned

322
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,339
obsolescence thing on its head if you

323
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,260
make something you try and have it

324
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,490
current all the time indeed it's going

325
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,589
to get obviously very quickly you have

326
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,690
this making this problem but what if we

327
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,790
can actually start with something that

328
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,280
is simple and by modern standards

329
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,370
totally obsolete in our cases an 8-bit

330
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,380
computer platform and work out what we

331
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,930
need to trim down in order to actually

332
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,630
make something that can work on that

333
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,209
kind of simple system and yet still

334
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,650
remain as useful as possible and because

335
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,200
we're working on the Mega 65 that was a

336
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,600
logical thing for us to do but also

337
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,980
things like the Commodore 64 demo seen

338
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,960
in Game Center actually still active

339
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,380
people are still working out how to push

340
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,940
the limits of what should be a very you

341
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,500
know constrained system that's not

342
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,410
capable of doing a great deal and in

343
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,510
fact instead can actually do a lot and

344
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,130
so we have she confidence that we can do

345
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,080
interesting things with that indeed that

346
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,360
in Linux confident January we gave an

347
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,310
entire presentation using a different

348
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,110
prototype of the Mega 65 with its own

349
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,829
slide software that we had a student

350
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:07,670
write in this semester so we think that

351
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,590
this is possible to do so here's a

352
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,439
couple of slides on how we built a

353
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,880
previous prototype just to give an idea

354
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,760
of some of the thinking that we're

355
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,890
trying to do around this so your regular

356
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,140
mobile phone is like the the part at the

357
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,530
top there everything is in one horrible

358
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,330
insecurity domain the mobile you know

359
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,819
the cellular modem can too often do

360
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,430
horrible things to the CPU directly

361
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,140
whether the CPU even can notice them or

362
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,620
not it will depend on the architecture

363
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,319
and even if we say well maybe that's not

364
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,910
true for all chipsets we can't prove it

365
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,100
for any particular chipset without a

366
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,050
huge amount of effort that we simply

367
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,570
cannot trust the devices because they

368
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,270
are too complex for us to be able to

369
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,770
determine what the architecture is in

370
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,380
them let alone to be able to do anything

371
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,120
in that so our approach instead is to

372
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,470
break it apart and not just for a

373
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,020
cellular modem but we can have other

374
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,390
things like a Raspberry Pi as a compute

375
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,810
module that can run Android natively as

376
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,480
a servant processor a slave processor of

377
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,550
what is effectively a Commodore 64 and

378
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,140
we can make sure that that doesn't have

379
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,900
direct access to the microphone doesn't

380
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,439
have direct access to the speaker so

381
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,970
that we can really quarantine that and

382
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,920
you know do encrypted phone calls all of

383
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,540
these sorts of things if we want to in a

384
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,870
way that we can actually be much more

385
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,550
confident about the security of

386
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,170
and because it is so important for

387
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,630
mobile phones this whole thing of how we

388
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,180
do the audio path and protect that from

389
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,010
malicious devices is really important so

390
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,500
in the Mega 65 and a megaphone that we

391
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,240
were building around that we have this

392
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,010
audio crossbar mixer so we can actually

393
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,230
control every input and every output

394
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,170
from the to and from the cellular modems

395
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,760
to the speaker the headphones bluetooth

396
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,920
everything so that we can limit the

397
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,170
clear text audio path to only where it

398
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,110
needs to go but also it makes it you can

399
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,459
use commodore 64 music as ringtones or

400
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,500
play it as hold music to someone on the

401
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:05,960
phone if you want to because we have

402
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,250
full sovereignty over the device so this

403
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,310
started then boiling down in our

404
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,450
thinking to you know basically turning

405
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,180
the whole idea of having a management

406
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:17,630
engine on its head if you think about

407
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,949
modern complex CPUs you have a

408
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,530
reasonable degree of sovereignty over

409
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,480
the main part of the CPU the application

410
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,730
processor what you don't tend to have

411
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,320
sovereignty over is the management

412
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,020
engine in whatever form it takes on

413
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,190
different architectures so what if

414
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,050
instead we actually say well we can't

415
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,150
trust the complex processes but we can

416
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,750
trust the 8-bit machine so we'll make

417
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,819
that be like the management engine so

418
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,050
we're nominally calling this the little

419
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,230
brother

420
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,719
and so that separates all the components

421
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,370
and lets us control what we want to do

422
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,130
lets us do things like use a complete

423
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,110
Raspberry Pi running Android because we

424
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,420
can quarantine it we could even actually

425
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,770
virtualize its access to storage so that

426
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,140
you could have multiple instances of

427
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,730
Android and choose between them that

428
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,250
can't contact one another and of course

429
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,290
the cellular modem but we could have all

430
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,780
sorts of other components and because

431
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,819
that connection between Russia managed

432
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,730
by an 8-bit computer you can program in

433
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,139
basic the barrier to entry to integrate

434
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,620
that together is actually traumatically

435
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,030
reduced and of course it has the other

436
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,889
side effects that we can boot it in

437
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,149
under two seconds and you can play fun

438
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,410
games while you wait for the cellular

439
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,600
modem to actually boot up for you to be

440
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,010
able to make a call you know again you

441
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,179
have full sovereignty to do what you

442
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:35,570
want with the device and by generalizing

443
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,640
out the interfaces so if we use the som

444
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,710
form factor Raspberry Pi it can be

445
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,480
removable and if their new version comes

446
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,540
we can switch to the new version without

447
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,940
us having to rebuild a huge effort for

448
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,399
the capability likewise for the cellular

449
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,170
modems we can upgrade so the current

450
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,900
prototype that I have here currently has

451
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:56,000
a single 4G modem we have two bays we

452
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,040
could put two 4G modems in or when a 5g

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,500
modem comes out we can put it in and

454
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,790
that's the industry standard mini pcie

455
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,770
form factor for cellular modems and

456
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,330
we've got the coupling quite loose there

457
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,950
is a digital audio interface it goes

458
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,320
into the crossbar and that's again

459
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,210
industry standard and then it's the UART

460
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,129
interface with 80 commands and you can

461
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,680
do data over that as well at reasonable

462
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,450
speeds so that again we have these

463
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,130
things really separated so that they

464
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,950
cannot interfere with one another and

465
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,510
for the cellular modem or the Raspberry

466
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,970
Pi to have malicious software that tries

467
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,830
to hack the Commodore 64 little brother

468
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,930
piece of it is going to be really hard

469
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,970
to do and besides it's very hard to try

470
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,710
and hide malware in 64 kilobytes without

471
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:41,240
someone noticing that there is a tiger

472
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:42,740
under the rug so to speak and we can do

473
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,510
other things with that so we can have a

474
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,070
gen lock for the video so that we can do

475
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,629
overlaying of the two together in Nice

476
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,260
where's a whole pile of refinements that

477
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,460
we can do around that it also means it

478
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,470
if you would be really paranoid at any

479
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,840
point you could actually take out all

480
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,550
the untrustable components and be left

481
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,610
with only the trustable core of the

482
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,740
machine to do some sensitive actions and

483
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,350
like with the the libram 5 we have hard

484
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,530
physical hardware switches to be able to

485
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,629
turn things off so again we're talking

486
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,240
about having a device which is you know

487
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,560
that you can have sovereignty over so

488
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,000
I've been quite sovereign over the

489
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,909
design of this as a bunch of features

490
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,800
that probably half of them nobody else

491
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,750
wants to see all together in a phone at

492
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,220
the same time so maybe they would like

493
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,620
to have these two Bay's to put different

494
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,030
radios and things in we've put full

495
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,489
microphones on there so that we can

496
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,530
experiment with doing you know

497
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,940
background noise rejection in a really

498
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,930
nice kind of way because I read a cool

499
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,970
paper about and thought that would be

500
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,940
great so no 2 dollars a piece

501
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,860
throw them in the design we put a

502
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,050
full-size SIM card and smart card reader

503
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,699
in there public is a build it would just

504
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,230
be fun to be able to use a full-size SIM

505
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,460
card like on the really old Nokia phones

506
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,030
since we're talking about an 8-bit

507
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,830
computer the size of a house brick

508
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,649
but also we could actually make if we

509
00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:00,189
wanted to an electronic point-of-sales

510
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,510
machine with the the the banking card

511
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,360
reader in there because it's the same

512
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,040
physical interface I like to play the

513
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,800
old Commodore game so I've put a hundred

514
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,110
disabled capable to watch speaker and

515
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,690
amplifier in there so that it can do a

516
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,449
you know as loud as we want

517
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,130
we've got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and a

518
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,020
joystick plugs we can actually use real

519
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,000
joysticks again you may not want this on

520
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,220
your phone that's fine you can make it

521
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,350
how you want and without a huge amount

522
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,090
of effort and because I do work with

523
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,429
humanitarian sector we want a device

524
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,560
that we can use in the field for several

525
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,270
days without being recharged so it's put

526
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,010
a huge battery in it and the entire back

527
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,020
surface will actually be a solar panel

528
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,480
with sort of between five and 10 watts

529
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,940
of capacity and because I'll lead the

530
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,680
civil project I wanted to put mesh

531
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,540
capable radios in this we've put tribe

532
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,590
and Laura in there that can work around

533
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,430
we'll talk a little bit more about that

534
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,800
at the end and so we could make totally

535
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,690
different things we could make a field

536
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,700
hospital unit based on much the same

537
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,200
hardware but we can put you know the

538
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,670
pulse ox e-reader that goes in your

539
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,880
finger and checks your heartbeat and

540
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,810
blood oxygenation we already talked

541
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,830
about there having a point of sales

542
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:10,000
machine or field data collection for

543
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,730
disaster zones there's a whole bunch of

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,250
things that we can do one more that

545
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,800
you've got me really excited is by

546
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,300
effectively virtualizing an android

547
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,919
implementations access to its

548
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,440
peripherals its physical interface

549
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,930
peripherals we can make a platform that

550
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,940
makes it super easy to make smart phones

551
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,500
that are customized for use by people

552
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,600
living with disability of different

553
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,330
kinds so some people might be able to

554
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,550
use you know a joystick because they

555
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,550
only have gross motor control but not a

556
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,990
touchscreen we can have that actually

557
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,480
pretend to be the touchscreen to the

558
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,800
Android without having to touch a single

559
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,750
line of code or even recompile Android

560
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,090
so all 99% of the complexity has now

561
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,130
been shoved out the way some code in

562
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,899
Commodore 64 basic or assembly language

563
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,810
is all that needs to be maintained to

564
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,070
make the touchscreen interface and so a

565
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,260
person with disability could actually

566
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,360
even iterate over that progressively to

567
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,230
make it better for them without even

568
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,270
having to come back to

569
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,350
someone else for help that has been

570
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,139
excited about bridging the digital

571
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:15,459
divide and doing great things with

572
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,780
digital sovereignty but the last five to

573
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,660
ten minutes that we have I want to talk

574
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,549
about the challenges around having

575
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,320
packet radio enabled phone so that we

576
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,660
can make infrastructure independence

577
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,870
with these digitally sovereign devices

578
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,280
so some other phones already in theory

579
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,809
have this capability you could plug a

580
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,610
thing in the USB at the bottom but

581
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,230
that's annoying the fairphone to

582
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,699
actually has pads in the back that you

583
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,110
could make a thicker case that had an

584
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,940
extra radio and things in there if you

585
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,979
wanted to but again you have this whole

586
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,230
problem of the complexity of the system

587
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,700
their effort to maintain the integration

588
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,710
even if you managed to compile it and

589
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,830
you know just not having the right size

590
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,510
battery in these devices so what we've

591
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,740
done with the law of radios for the

592
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,809
moment and we can do with any other

593
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,700
radio that we want is these connect via

594
00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:00,610
the little brother the Commodore 64 like

595
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,140
implementation and they can even

596
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,969
actually keep working when the FPGA is

597
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,710
off to save power because we can

598
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,059
independently control the power systems

599
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,760
in there they can do an interrupt that

600
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,970
wait see fpga up to process packets if

601
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,140
we have need to and so it can be quite

602
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,280
energy-efficient and do a whole pile of

603
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,690
interesting things whether it's at a

604
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,860
protocol level or you know

605
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,480
software-defined radio there's a whole

606
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:24,909
bunch of things that we can really do

607
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,799
and we just kind of hopped through so

608
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,980
that we really covered the bulk of that

609
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,629
so just want to talk now about some of

610
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,510
the physical is and the legals around

611
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,860
how we can try and do this kind of you

612
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,780
know Peter Piot telephony with a

613
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,918
digitally sovereign device because of

614
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,350
course on mobile phones we're really

615
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,730
limited in what can be achieved but with

616
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,370
this actually the world is open to us to

617
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,650
how we want to do it so first of all

618
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:52,120
there are a bunch of what are commonly

619
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,010
called license free bands so but they're

620
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,809
not free for licensing saying where that

621
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,780
GPL license code is not free of a

622
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,668
license what it has is a liberal license

623
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,790
that lets you use it in really nice and

624
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:05,590
and reasonably sovereign ways with

625
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,210
respect to other people trying to use it

626
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,020
as well

627
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,299
unfortunately there's no single global

628
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,700
band and even in the regions that are

629
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:15,990
meant to have you know harmonized

630
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,890
regulation this is not actually the case

631
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,040
and of course in Europe you're actually

632
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,300
particularly badly offers

633
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,409
understand you got this teeny tiny bit

634
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:26,780
at 868 megahertz and a little bit at 433

635
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,250
to 434 which I think has horrible duty

636
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,010
cycle restrictions on it if you want to

637
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,440
transmit at any sensible power in

638
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,640
Australia we're a living in the US and a

639
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,800
few other countries are a bit luckier

640
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,380
we've got anywhere between five and

641
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,780
twenty five megahertz around 900

642
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,870
megahertz with one watt ERP or a four

643
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:47,720
watt Co ARP in some jurisdictions and

644
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:50,060
that's much more useful but again with a

645
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,550
sovereign device we can put all three

646
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,889
bands in there's not that expensive to

647
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,270
do and we can get creative about how we

648
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,190
can use those in ways that are

649
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,470
consistent with you know the social

650
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,150
license around that and do really

651
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,710
interesting so we won't use GPS to work

652
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,500
out which band to use and what

653
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,940
particular rules apply but not having to

654
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,680
have it get permission from a central

655
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:14,270
database because at that point you've

656
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,670
lost your sovereignty so we want to you

657
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,129
know allow that and we've talked it a

658
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,480
little bit about that the 900 make band

659
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,090
in the countries that have it is

660
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,700
actually really nice you can get

661
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,010
multiple kilometers even with a quite

662
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,990
simple wave form and with Laura type

663
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,720
radio so you can get tens of kilobits

664
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,900
over kilometers to tens of kilometers so

665
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,980
this is really interesting for trying to

666
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,870
you know make a useful localized mission

667
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,340
network that could span quite a distance

668
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,469
so it certainly we would have no trouble

669
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,020
if we had it available here on camp from

670
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,240
end to end with a bunch of people using

671
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,340
it with carefully designed protocols and

672
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:57,260
that's another piece that's beyond what

673
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,220
we have time to cover and so was the 433

674
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,780
band we've talked a little bit about

675
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,150
that already

676
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,100
what's interesting is that this is now

677
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,650
more available globally than it used to

678
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,250
be there seems to be a desire to allow

679
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:13,100
import of European targeted 433 434

680
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,530
megahertz band devices Australia she

681
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,820
recently allowed their use with

682
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,430
particular restrictions that don't line

683
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,780
up exactly with here in Europe and it

684
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,390
has a nice advantage that as we push

685
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,310
down and that UHF band it gets a little

686
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,900
bit bendier it goes around obstacles a

687
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,409
little bit better and it tends to carry

688
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,970
further with reduced loss but my

689
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,720
understanding and you guys will know

690
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,309
better than I did

691
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,230
here in Europe is still reasonably

692
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:38,530
congested and there are those

693
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,480
restrictions with the duty cycle are

694
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,760
particularly limiting in practice

695
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,919
looking with a sovereign device as the

696
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,629
regulations change or if someone

697
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,090
licenses about we can actually make use

698
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,520
of them we're not limited to a defective

699
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:55,610
vendors implementation that is overly

700
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,110
paranoid about the use of bands and duty

701
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,770
cycle or maybe they've just implemented

702
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:04,539
the most horrible narrow common set that

703
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:08,120
works in all jurisdictions in 868

704
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,400
similar kinds of problems to 434 I think

705
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,379
it's only a quarter of a megahertz wide

706
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,470
that's practically usable and is quite

707
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,900
congested once again but we don't have

708
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,299
to stick with those bands depending on

709
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,850
what you're trying to do there can be a

710
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,918
bunch of different options available so

711
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,020
there are some legacy bands like the

712
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,429
citizen band radio it depends on your

713
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,100
jurisdiction whether you're allowed to

714
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,929
do digital over it and if you are what

715
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,899
wave forms and duty cycles and things

716
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:38,870
apply but it often gives you quite a

717
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,450
number of channels and again down at the

718
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:44,658
27 megahertz kind of band for the the

719
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:47,600
old VHF CB this is really quite nice and

720
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:50,030
bendy and will go in many cases sort of

721
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,360
around a hill or two and can be great

722
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:55,970
for hooking people up in remote areas

723
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,500
and even the UHF CB ranges can be quite

724
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,840
decent and often these will have much

725
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,179
higher transmit powers so whilst your

726
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,100
data rates may be lower it may be more

727
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,990
practical in you know when you should

728
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,730
try to use it to get communications over

729
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,070
long range we're thinking the target

730
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,590
kind of applications is text messaging

731
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,450
and small file exchange not full-on live

732
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,340
voice and things although again with

733
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,870
work and a sovereign device people can

734
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:21,830
explore that space and try and push the

735
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:24,080
boundaries or you can just actually just

736
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,730
go on licensing spectrum depending on

737
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,740
where you're trying to work this can

738
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,970
actually be quite cheap so we do have a

739
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,309
lot of our field work in the outback in

740
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,650
Australia where the spectrum has

741
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,940
practically no value no one wants to

742
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,549
license anything other than the main

743
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,980
cellular bands and so for a couple of

744
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,918
hundred dollars a year we have in the

745
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:46,070
past and can easily again license quite

746
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,520
a nice slab of UHF frequency possibly

747
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,030
even down to

748
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,040
VHF so that we can get really long range

749
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:54,470
but again with a full sovereignty we can

750
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,590
do even crazier things if we want to we

751
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,050
could actually tie in HF radios in a

752
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,310
hybrid kind of Network and listen we're

753
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,500
looking up with a several mesh as well

754
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,060
so that we can choose the right kind of

755
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,460
link for the right circumstance and

756
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,500
actually make a whole infrastructure

757
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,120
that for communities will allow them to

758
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,950
communicate even over the long range so

759
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,139
with HF we could hook up Islands in

760
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,910
South Pacific island nations for example

761
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,500
who currently have to depend on

762
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,030
satellite phones or you know literally

763
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,960
getting in a boat and going to the next

764
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:26,270
Island but also because we're making a

765
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,560
fully sovereign device we could be

766
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,420
software-defined radio if we want to an

767
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,179
FPGA is great for that we have an FPGA

768
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:34,970
implementing the little brother so this

769
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,310
could be done and again with some care

770
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,780
and distributing updated bit streams via

771
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,120
all these same kind of communications

772
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,310
protocols we could even update in the

773
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,810
field in near real-time the capabilities

774
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,220
of the device because we have the

775
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,050
sovereignty over don't have to wait for

776
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,930
the vendor to decide whether they even

777
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:57,710
want to help us solve a humanitarian

778
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:59,120
need we can just get out and do it so as

779
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,950
we start to get to the end there's all

780
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,340
these different bearers the whole

781
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,630
protocol area around this is still an

782
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,340
open one there's been a lot of great

783
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:10,130
work on mesh communications and

784
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,689
peer-to-peer and delay tolerant what I

785
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,700
would say is that with this kind of

786
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,750
system the best place to start is

787
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,700
actually with delay tolerant

788
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,580
communications and things like text

789
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,430
messaging that has high value and really

790
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,679
can facilitate useful interventions and

791
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,830
capabilities for people but without

792
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,390
being so complicated to implement in a

793
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:33,020
robust way that can work on these kinds

794
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:35,000
of bandwidth constraint networks but

795
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,280
this isn't so that people can't work on

796
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,540
new protocols that continue to push the

797
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,760
boundaries and again if we have the

798
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,290
freedom to innovate the radio and be

799
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,210
able to try these things in the field so

800
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,129
that we can really rapidly innovate

801
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,830
without permission then I think we can

802
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,050
actually do a whole lot more and so for

803
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,070
us we're going to look to port the

804
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,159
several rhizome delay-tolerant

805
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,950
networking protocol to this device we

806
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,210
had the lower radios and

807
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:03,520
see what we can do with that so in

808
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,590
conclusion then I really just want us to

809
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,200
reflect on this whole issue of the

810
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,669
digital sovereignty that we have lost

811
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,280
but that I think we can actually reclaim

812
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,260
that with carefully designing these

813
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,180
compartmentalized architectures and

814
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,730
having it you know the piece that binds

815
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,800
it together you know the One Ring so to

816
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,390
speak but instead of binding in darkness

817
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,850
that you can bind us together in the

818
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,920
light to be able to do great things so

819
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:29,620
long as it's simple enough that everyone

820
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,340
can learn how to use it and adapt it and

821
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,090
make it better

822
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,070
and you know to demonstrate conclusively

823
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,709
that we can remove these barriers I mean

824
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,230
we've made this device I reckon it's

825
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,420
cost us 500 euros give or take from

826
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,600
scratch in hardware and it's been myself

827
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,090
and two or three students over a span of

828
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,530
less than two years to make a device

829
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,679
that we can carry around and that's

830
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,800
capable of making encrypted phone calls

831
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,650
if we so wish so we're confident that

832
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,270
this can be done and we would love for

833
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,040
others who would like to even just

834
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,330
replicate what we've done or have

835
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,830
different ideas about how it should be

836
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,929
done again we want to emphasize the

837
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,699
sovereignty angle and to work with us

838
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,160
you know it's really bring this to be a

839
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,230
reality and to help people who can

840
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,700
benefit from it and just break up this

841
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,070
whole problem of lost digital

842
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,360
sovereignty so at that point I will stop

843
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,950
I would be delighted to take any

844
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,949
questions that people have

845
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,000
[Applause]

846
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,820
okay we have about 10-ish minutes for

847
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,100
questions so there should be some

848
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,960
microphone angels jumping around I can't

849
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,929
see anything from the stage but make

850
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,730
yourself visible to them and beautiful

851
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,010
things will happen while we wait for

852
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,540
this could you maybe just hold up the

853
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,500
megaphone yeah sure

854
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,770
because I feel like I couldn't really

855
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,210
see the Esaias yeah and I mean this is

856
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,460
what we've just built in the lab so it's

857
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,830
laser-cut for the different layers for

858
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,870
the case because it was easy but you

859
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,389
know it's nice adult-sized game console

860
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:08,060
size and we can easily reduce that size

861
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,350
down again it just takes effort to work

862
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,860
on the different pieces now that I saw a

863
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:15,740
hand back there yes could we go there

864
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,219
please okay we have someone ready with a

865
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:23,540
question I saw someone okay yeah this

866
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,310
thing's on you've talked a lot about the

867
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,320
capabilities and all of that but not

868
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:30,260
really much about distribution or

869
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,840
fabrication is this something that you

870
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,270
can get a kit for or do you need to like

871
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,780
make the PCB yourself by all the parts

872
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:40,129
etc etc okay so at the moment we don't

873
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,620
have kids we're not at the point of

874
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,090
having a refined PCB that you would even

875
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,739
want to build yourself we hopefully will

876
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,820
be at that point in a few months and

877
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,440
again these are all areas that we would

878
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,480
love to have the community work with us

879
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,610
to make it reproducible in the first

880
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,460
instance there will be some effort and

881
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,990
learning curve initially but then we

882
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,610
want that to reverie rapidly we know

883
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,530
that it can rapidly tail off so that

884
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,199
people can buy a kit or even buy a

885
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,180
complete unit what's interesting with

886
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,250
that is with the Mega 65 the desktop

887
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,320
retro computer is that we actually have

888
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,460
a path to market outlined around there

889
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,920
and so we could actually leverage that

890
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,650
so I simply sell this as a game console

891
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,000
to make enough scale of economy to start

892
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,130
doing more interesting things with it as

893
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,830
a platform without people even having to

894
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,260
work to build a kit themselves so do you

895
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:28,190
have a website or a github we absolutely

896
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:30,260
do if you go to the Mega 65 website make

897
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,670
a $65 or there's a feedback form and you

898
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,610
can just basically cut that will contact

899
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:38,170
me directly or hop over to github slash

900
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:40,700
mega 65 and there are some repos there

901
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:44,000
okay thank you do we have a question

902
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:45,178
from the internet it's their signal in

903
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,549
the room

904
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,509
they're not questions from the internet

905
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:54,059
ok Internet ask some questions please

906
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:56,609
and now please another from here hello

907
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:59,700
first thank you for making this great

908
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,380
idea possible I have a question I have

909
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,710
seen that you are planning to do

910
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,950
encrypting phone calls and using some

911
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:10,589
public frequencies in which F VHF or PM

912
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,839
are possible unfortunately the law in

913
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:16,619
Europe in all the countries as far as I

914
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:19,589
know in the u.s. restricts the use of

915
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:22,109
public non-commercial frequencies with

916
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:25,319
the condition that no form of encryption

917
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:29,130
or voice scrambling even is possible for

918
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:31,799
analog and digital yes this this very

919
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,660
spot jurisdiction but if you there has

920
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:35,249
to be gap in that because on Wi-Fi which

921
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,950
is one of these publicly licensed

922
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:40,439
frequencies for 2.4 gigahertz we all

923
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,569
totally have to do HTTPS which is

924
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,130
encrypted so yes we need to look at the

925
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,839
laws and find out what is possible and

926
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,130
what is not one of the other things we

927
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,019
found is really interesting is that in

928
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,930
most countries one-time pad is not

929
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:54,419
restricted because the faculty is one

930
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:57,210
bit encryption one bit per bit but the

931
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,559
keys are only one bit each and so if

932
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,480
it's knowing people you want to

933
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,400
communicate with it's quite easy for us

934
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,710
to have a secure physical one-time pad

935
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,049
on this device that these untrustable

936
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,970
components can never get access to but

937
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:10,019
the little brother can mediate access to

938
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,689
so there's a whole bunch of interesting

939
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:15,390
new ways that we can do this that can

940
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,309
really give secure communications and in

941
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:21,239
a way that's consistent with national

942
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:22,529
law I fully agree but I just wanted to

943
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,960
point out that in some countries like

944
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:27,720
Slovakia Czech Republic and so on the

945
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,390
wording specific is any form of it's

946
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,098
just a simple sentence also I will be

947
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,839
really happy if this will be possible

948
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,579
yeah it will be interesting you mean if

949
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,319
it if the law is that straightforward

950
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,779
it may be worth someone challenging on

951
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,489
the basis that clearly HTTPS is a form

952
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:45,779
of encryption and you don't mean to

953
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:49,220
exclude that thank you ok or what about

954
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:51,530
the Internet still no signal

955
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,740
no questions

956
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,810
then please continue yeah well this is

957
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,439
an amazing project actually I'm glad

958
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:03,230
somebody took on this idea my question

959
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,750
is as far as I understood you could be

960
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,720
able instead of using an 8-bit platform

961
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:12,500
which can be trusted you could put your

962
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,319
knowledge into an FPGA IP car and gain

963
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,660
more processing power or put in whatever

964
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,390
you want this is an excellent point and

965
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,190
we've already done it the AP processor

966
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,230
is all in an FPGA we've implemented the

967
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,940
commodore 64 and a sheeter Commodore 65

968
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,680
prototype system that was never

969
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,390
commercially released and it actually

970
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,490
extended that a little bit we can run at

971
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,629
40 megahertz instead of one we have a

972
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,850
little bit more RAM than the Commodore

973
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,650
64 had and DMA and a bunch of other

974
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,900
useful things but in something which is

975
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:41,090
still architectural II simple enough to

976
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,190
understand but you're absolutely right

977
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,930
and so all of these this thinking is

978
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,390
fantastic and you know the more that

979
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:50,089
want to pitch in and and work with it

980
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,569
we'd love for that to happen oh well

981
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,970
great

982
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:55,220
just one question you did a lot of field

983
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,750
tests as far as I understand what's your

984
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,410
working background you and your

985
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,170
colleagues

986
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:02,899
okay so I work at Flinders University

987
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,610
and I teach computer science networking

988
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,110
with security and so the fieldwork

989
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,120
really is around a several mesh which is

990
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:10,280
around disaster Communications we work

991
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,170
with Red Cross World Food Programme and

992
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,780
a bunch of organizations I'm happy to

993
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,410
talk about to focus about that anytime

994
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,680
on camp as well well thanks thanks all

995
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,960
right

996
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:25,100
next question from the room I guess if

997
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,130
the internet is silent I was wondering

998
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,920
what was the freedom status for instance

999
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:34,520
what if pg8 will chain you use or with

1000
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,890
all the software software on it yeah

1001
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,870
okay so this is an area that we would

1002
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,629
love to have some help with the FPGA

1003
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:43,549
were using is a Xilinx FPGA and we are

1004
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,680
using at the moment the proprietary tool

1005
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:48,320
chain I don't like being stuck in that

1006
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,000
situation so we would love for folks to

1007
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,910
be had a nibble away on that part of the

1008
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,140
problem and you know find solutions and

1009
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,700
even your open silicon would be

1010
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,350
fantastic to do if we can get to that

1011
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,600
point I would love to reach that point

1012
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:01,430
but at the moment we're busy solving all

1013
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,470
of the other problems around that as you

1014
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,299
make a working phone that people can

1015
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,368
build their own of

1016
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,260
and compiled you know within an hour and

1017
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:15,050
you and do your really whatever they

1018
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:16,849
want with it maybe with an ECB five you

1019
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,790
wouldn't have the to chain is true for

1020
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:21,200
the FPGA yeah look so again we would

1021
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,450
love to use some of the open tool chain

1022
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,368
if PTAs we need help to do the porting

1023
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,980
because we're flat-out doing all of the

1024
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:31,819
other bits and pieces so we'd love your

1025
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,950
help if you want to all right do we have

1026
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:37,220
another question you can talk off to

1027
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:41,118
watch frog and Venus in Leo knows the

1028
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:43,399
kinds of dodge go Vienna as a well okay

1029
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,319
no we can also do questions in German

1030
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,020
for interesting reasons

1031
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:51,700
is anyone else anyone else has a

1032
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:54,259
question just internet have a question

1033
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,839
okay I do actually have a question sure

1034
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,990
so you in the end you you were talking a

1035
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:01,790
lot about bendiness of the signal yeah

1036
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,348
can you say something well but the

1037
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,329
physics behind us yeah okay so basically

1038
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:07,849
the longer the wavelength of a radio

1039
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:09,079
signal the bender it is and conversely

1040
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:11,450
the shorter the wavelength the less

1041
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,490
bendy it is when I say bendy this is of

1042
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,009
course a highly scientific term yeah for

1043
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:20,509
you know getting around obstacles okay

1044
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:22,970
but how does it Bend God deep physics a

1045
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,040
lecture would be possibly a better

1046
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,808
person to answer that in detail but if

1047
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,730
you see think about waves in a puddle of

1048
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:30,400
water if you make big slow waves they

1049
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:33,200
will Bend and refract around obstacles

1050
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,119
in all manner of crazy ways and you get

1051
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,009
the back flopping of waves if you make

1052
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,390
little ripples that are all short

1053
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,619
wavelength let you see they don't bend

1054
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,690
anywhere near as much it is literally

1055
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:44,270
the same thing happening just with atoms

1056
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:47,450
instead of water sloshing around alright

1057
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:49,759
very corn do we have another question it

1058
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:53,750
can also be even more physics based for

1059
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,250
the physicists in the audience no okay

1060
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,540
then please give us big a warm round of

1061
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,540
applause thank you

1062
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,000
[Applause]

1063
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,040
and of course if anyone wants to catch

1064
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,470
up and have a look at the the phone or

1065
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,550
the desktop mega 65 prototype that we've

1066
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:15,430
got here or just otherwise catch up yeah

1067
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:17,319
come grab me we don't really have a

1068
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,299
fixed spot where we hang out but you

1069
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:20,800
know my mobile number was there at the

1070
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:28,510
beginning if we just hopped back

1071
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:32,200
momentarily or in the meantime to

1072
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:35,819
toilet-related announcements wash your

1073
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:39,379
hands don't steal brushes thank you yeah

1074
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:47,269
okay thanks

1075
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:47,269
[Applause]

1076
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,319
[Music]

1077
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,270
you
