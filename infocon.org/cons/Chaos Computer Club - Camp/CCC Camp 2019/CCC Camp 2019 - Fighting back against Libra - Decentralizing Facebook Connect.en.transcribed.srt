1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:21,259
see see camel 2019 I'm very happy to

2
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,329
introduce our next speaker and his name

3
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:26,090
is Harry Halpern he's the founder of

4
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:30,129
NIMH and the project coordinator of the

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,860
next leap and he's talking about

6
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,570
fighting a big back against library

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,899
decentralizing Facebook Connect name

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,879
anonymous authentication credentials and

9
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm happy he's here please give a big

10
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:53,328
applause for Harry Hopman so it's always

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,050
good to be back at Kaos computer camp a

12
00:00:53,329 --> 00:01:00,050
few years ago when I first came to Chaos

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:02,660
Computer Congress I was working on

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,328
JavaScript cryptography was really

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,189
thrilled that the community here came

16
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:11,240
back for camp where I talked about my

17
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:13,939
own rather personal experiences in terms

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,969
of surveillance and over the last few

19
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,859
years what I've been up to with a lot of

20
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,990
other people who will congratulate at

21
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:23,240
the end and who really have done a huge

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,729
amount of work is we've been trying to

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,958
build something which I think Chaos

24
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,700
Computer Congress inspired me to work on

25
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:34,579
decentralized privacy enhancing

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,819
technologies and in particular we're

27
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:40,098
gonna look at the case of Facebook as a

28
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,799
whole but in particularly what we

29
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:44,599
believe is the most dangerous part of

30
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,569
not only Facebook but all of the

31
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,539
centralization inside of Silicon Valley

32
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:53,240
which is their identity systems in

33
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:55,450
particular Facebook Connect and then

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,539
we're going to see how privacy enhanced

35
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,939
decentralized alternatives work so

36
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:06,189
fighting gets back against Libre and I

37
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:09,038
think you know the issue with Libre

38
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:11,000
originally called global coin is

39
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,359
incredibly politically and

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,770
philosophically interesting it saw its

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,520
signals that the nation-state order that

42
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,040
arised in Germany the Treaty of

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,129
Westphalia is collapsing

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:34,399
and that now private companies are now

45
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:37,040
taking over parts of infrastructure and

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,629
parts of services that were

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,209
traditionally provided by governments

48
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:46,010
currency is obviously one case and

49
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:49,099
identity is another and they're

50
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,349
intimately connected a global coin shows

51
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:54,078
that the ambition of Mark Zuckerberg and

52
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,260
the ambition of I think any of these

53
00:02:54,079 --> 00:03:01,129
companies is to build a global system of

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:04,638
identity which is a necessity for a

55
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:07,069
global system of currency and that I

56
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,940
believe is extremely dangerous dangerous

57
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:13,518
insofar as if it is ran an authoritarian

58
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,639
manner in all for-profit companies are

59
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,060
ran in an authoritarian manner this is

60
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:23,480
actually considerably worse the

61
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,540
nation-state identity and incredibly

62
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,638
dangerous in compared to for example you

63
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:33,108
know decentralized key base identity or

64
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:36,340
federated email based identity so Libra

65
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:39,859
is announced as a global cryptocurrency

66
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,980
it actually makes quite a lot of sense

67
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:44,510
as a design of them a technical

68
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,940
perspective I'm not gonna go too far

69
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,828
into it I think Morgan Beller the

70
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,090
designer is somewhere here at camp so

71
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,040
you can talk to her about it but

72
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,609
effectively it is a blockchain

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,569
there are validators there are blocks

74
00:03:54,609 --> 00:04:00,919
transactions are collected and written

75
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:02,690
two blocks on that level not actually

76
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,000
particularly interesting uses a fast

77
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:08,150
consensus algorithm which has the rather

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,060
hilarious name hot crap and is

79
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,940
essentially the validators confirm

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,668
transactions and this is where it gets

81
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,228
interesting because the validators are

82
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:24,530
the exact same companies and to some

83
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:28,430
extent investors and startups that

84
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:31,340
really power surveillance capitalism so

85
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,950
it's not just Facebook although Facebook

86
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,260
has built the technology and initiate

87
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,229
the effort they've created what's called

88
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,320
a Swiss

89
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,690
verne which is a equivalent to a mutual

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,390
Association and in this mutual

91
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,910
Association there are different

92
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,610
companies including some traditional

93
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,880
blockchain companies such as coinbase

94
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:58,830
large investment firms Anderson Horowitz

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,080
but also startups uber lyft and both

96
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,260
huge Silicon Valley companies such as

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,130
eBay telco providers such as Vodafone

98
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:11,849
and the current sort of payment

99
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:15,930
providers MasterCard Visa PayPal I mean

100
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,990
this is an incredibly powerful group of

101
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:23,190
companies and the primary design bet of

102
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,280
the Facebook Cali Libre Association is

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,520
that each of these companies has paid

104
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,909
ten million upfront to be a validator

105
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,919
for these transactions so that you know

106
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,020
even though the blockchain itself will

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,300
be public there will be an API against

108
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,400
it you'll probably be able to write apps

109
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,100
against it and it is interesting and I

110
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,810
think very to some extent cypherpunk to

111
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,520
try to put open-source in the middle of

112
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,440
such a titanically huge company which

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,870
really controls like the identity of a

114
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,290
third of sentient life in terms of

115
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,520
humanity nonetheless these are the

116
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,190
companies that we're trusting to

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,270
validate the transactions so on that

118
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,340
level it's not exactly decentralized but

119
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,719
that's not the real problem there's been

120
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,549
lots of complaints is that the

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,040
blockchain system is the real blockchain

122
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,430
system is it decentralized the real

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,690
problem and from an economic perspective

124
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,300
which I think we should actually

125
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,219
congratulate Facebook on is that they're

126
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,440
saying it's completely absurd that the

127
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,080
US government is the reserve currency of

128
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,330
the world I mean come on Trump's empower

129
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
they're doing a trade war with China

130
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,140
they are printing tons of money just

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,000
sustain unsustainable American consumer

132
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,530
debt so they took a basket of

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,840
uncorrelated assets yen dollars Swiss

134
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,340
franc combine them with percentages and

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,960
they've created a new currency and this

136
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,960
actually does threaten the US dollar as

137
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,690
a reserve

138
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,568
currency and that's where the actions

139
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,719
been you can see the US Congress is

140
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:02,229
called the kind of media head and the

141
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,380
director of Libre inside of Facebook to

142
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:08,169
testify at Congress but I think weirdly

143
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,020
enough I mean probably Facebook screwed

144
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,599
it up probably the regulator's will not

145
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,460
allow private companies to rant create a

146
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,669
new global payment and transaction

147
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,008
system based on essentially a basket of

148
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,430
currencies which will disrupt the dollar

149
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:26,889
and you know the III would be dubious if

150
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,870
the kind of six billion that got put in

151
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,349
the Libre associations Swiss bank

152
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,419
account

153
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,070
the US government can't poke through and

154
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,169
get all the way to the sixty bill you

155
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:39,250
know however much it is inside of

156
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:41,289
Facebook's bank account nonetheless if

157
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,270
it does happen and we already know these

158
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:45,460
things will eventually work even a

159
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,530
Facebook does it do it you know people

160
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,169
will have phone numbers and be able to

161
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,090
send payments and in their phones and

162
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,639
this will lead to tons of payment and

163
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,770
and the vision that Facebook is pushing

164
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,800
with a Libra alt is that this will allow

165
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,169
us to Bank the unbanked this will allow

166
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,080
us that the you know the large portion

167
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,159
of humanity in countries like India

168
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,380
sub-saharan Africa that do not have

169
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,789
access to bank accounts as an American

170
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,560
in Europe it's actually really hard to

171
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,500
get a European bank account this will

172
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,490
allow people to have bank accounts

173
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,509
however what even though Facebook has

174
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,880
said we will not use your personal data

175
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:27,520
in the Liebherr Association we will not

176
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,580
share your personal data with say PayPal

177
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,029
or whoever the people running the

178
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:38,078
validators there is this giant loophole

179
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:42,729
and that is that the wallet the caliber

180
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:44,949
wallet will have to do what's called kyc

181
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,520
AML know your customer anti money

182
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,029
laundering

183
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,750
they will essentially have to identify

184
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:55,180
every person using the Calibra wallet

185
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,740
and they will be able to as they have

186
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,500
stated in their response to the

187
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,520
regulator's able to leverage the

188
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,890
tremendous amount of personal data

189
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,069
that they control at least they easily

190
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:12,300
can in order to take these pseudonymous

191
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,520
keys which are on the libra blockchain

192
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,349
which has validators which is replicable

193
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,750
and etc etc and they will be able to

194
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:24,600
attach identities to those keys and how

195
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,209
they do that is a software which no one

196
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,130
has talked about which is the most

197
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,979
important part of Facebook's current

198
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,689
empire and to be honest I believe

199
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,899
Calibra and Libra are just another way

200
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,149
to leverage this kind of technology to

201
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,980
create even more personal data because

202
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,350
right now Facebook obviously has your

203
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,330
friends and your name and all that but

204
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,550
they really would like your bank account

205
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,550
and this is done via what's called

206
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,800
Facebook Connect everyone who uses the

207
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,479
app typically science and with Facebook

208
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,399
Connect and there are probably as many

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,380
Facebook connector on the same magnitude

210
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,080
at least Facebook Connect transactions

211
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,810
are as there are visa transactions this

212
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,430
is the identity system of the Internet

213
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,529
currently for the vast majority of users

214
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,199
whether we like it or not and it as

215
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:14,910
hackers as programmers as people who

216
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,390
want to change the system we should

217
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,790
understand this incredibly vital

218
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,740
technology and build alternatives so the

219
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,010
technology is built on a very innocent

220
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,579
standard called IETF oo auth which

221
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,430
stands for web authorization and what o

222
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:34,349
is it was invented good friend of mine

223
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,109
another great anarchist protocol Blaine

224
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:40,560
cook was working at Twitter and at the

225
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,660
time in 2003 four or five you know

226
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,089
people wanted to sign onto Twitter but

227
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,750
they wanted some you know profile data

228
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:51,329
from them a photo easy access not having

229
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,380
to repeat passwords so you know at the

230
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,790
time they said well just give us your

231
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,020
gmail password I'll give you access to

232
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,640
Twitter but that's very dangerous

233
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,550
because then Twitter has access to your

234
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,250
entire Gmail so olaf was invented not as

235
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,890
a mass personal data collection scheme

236
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:10,380
but as a way to essentially help people

237
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:13,140
log in for single sign-on login and then

238
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,500
authorize the transfer of data and the

239
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,910
transfer data takes place through

240
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,430
following players the identity provider

241
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,319
the who is for example Facebook who has

242
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,109
a lot of your personal data and you

243
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,330
would like to hand that data to a

244
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,820
service provider also called a relying

245
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,010
party that needs his personal data and

246
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,540
you have the user who gave the person's

247
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,960
they did identity provider to begin with

248
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,400
it needs to authorize the service

249
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,410
provider so they've already

250
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,569
authenticated using a password

251
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,400
two-factor authentication whatever

252
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,980
- they didn't provider they've

253
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,569
approached a new service for example say

254
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,120
Twitter and they want to use their

255
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,440
Facebook ID to log in a Twitter and so

256
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,840
you want to transfer data without

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,820
sharing any authentication credentials

258
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,160
you might want to transfer all sorts of

259
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,910
data cities age whatever you want to

260
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,520
authorize that

261
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,020
and how OAuth does is very simple

262
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,730
because at the time JavaScript

263
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,290
cryptography and web cryptography in

264
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,210
general is very immature so they

265
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,010
couldn't use digital signatures people

266
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,110
couldn't interoperate with digital

267
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:19,189
signatures instead all security boils

268
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,450
down to TLS this is the kind of flow I'm

269
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,920
just gonna step through the flow really

270
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,900
quickly but you've all done this a

271
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,630
million times so you kind of know how it

272
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,060
works in the first step you go up to

273
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,580
Twitter and you say hi I would like to

274
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,020
use my Twitter account Twitter says do

275
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,760
you want to log in with Facebook you

276
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,449
click that log in with Facebook button

277
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,980
and you are effectively shipped over to

278
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,839
the IDP which in this case would be

279
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,150
Facebook now you're on

280
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,190
you got ship that step 2 step 3 you say

281
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,560
yeah facebook says do you want to

282
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,510
authorize Twitter to have my data you

283
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,849
click yes that's step 3

284
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,150
you move you when you click step 4 you

285
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,950
go back to Twitter Twitter you have a

286
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,920
token which is called a bearer token

287
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:03,640
that toke it is basically a time-stamped

288
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,780
kind of hash is when we think about it

289
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,949
essentially capability if you're in the

290
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,890
sort of that kind of way of thinking

291
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:12,110
about things you hand that token which

292
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,960
functions as a capability to Twitter

293
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,320
Twitter then shows that the Facebook and

294
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,780
step 6 and then step 7 all that precious

295
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:26,030
personal data flows from Facebook to

296
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:27,449
Twitter and what's really dangerous is

297
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,630
that you will have to

298
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:33,870
do that when you use Calibra when you

299
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,430
use a wallet which is compliant and

300
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,840
they'll use the regulation that

301
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,270
compliance regulations is the kind of

302
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,770
excuse there are privacy ways to be

303
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,930
compliant but of course I would be

304
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,510
highly dubious that people would not

305
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,089
leverage in our public data they can

306
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,819
that they already have to to use here

307
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,910
that they will be able to control your

308
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,620
financial data and send that data back

309
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,390
and forth using this kind of centralized

310
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,850
I did any scheme they've already set up

311
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:03,000
with Facebook connect to both verify who

312
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,190
you are and what you're purchasing

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,650
because in the current scheme as you may

314
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,720
have noticed the identity provider which

315
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,060
is Facebook in this case has a hundred

316
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,890
percent transparency to which services

317
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,540
you're using and when you're using them

318
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,090
and what calibra they would have a

319
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,860
hundred percent transparency into what

320
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,790
purchases you're making and who you're

321
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,620
making them less of when you're making

322
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,560
with them and that of course is a

323
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,880
tremendous amount of very valuable data

324
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,939
currently spread in a heterogeneous

325
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,770
manner among various banks seems to be a

326
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,460
great business ploy to push that all

327
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:38,819
together inside of Facebook and you know

328
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:43,550
we have to do something here I think to

329
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:47,010
prevent what will be effectively a

330
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,250
totalitarian identity system on a scale

331
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,770
that we have never seen before it will

332
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,480
destroy people making think however they

333
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,010
want about the blockchain space but

334
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,940
essentially attaching

335
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,790
Facebook identities via Facebook Connect

336
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,800
to pseudonymous keys will kill

337
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,770
innovation and the block chain space of

338
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,099
divine the blockchain and essentially a

339
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,850
mass-market

340
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,310
identified blockchain and it will be to

341
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,290
be honest total nonsense in terms of the

342
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,890
people they're trying to serve obviously

343
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:22,530
people who are in countries such as you

344
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,230
know which took India China may not have

345
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:28,050
all the identity papers may not be able

346
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,570
to pass normal banking compliance will

347
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,900
also not be able to pass very easily

348
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,090
banking compliance for the Calibra

349
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,220
wallet and maybe Facebook can help do

350
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,200
that via leveraging all this data but it

351
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,980
still seems to be a very flimsy excuse

352
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,140
to engage

353
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,460
this truly tremendous amount of data

354
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:51,000
collection so what we want is we want a

355
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,650
alternative and luckily cypherpunks have

356
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,090
been working on this along with academic

357
00:15:52,650 --> 00:16:00,199
photographers for more than 20 years so

358
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:03,840
the quote I'd like to repeat is that

359
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,390
privacy is the power to selectively

360
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,760
reveal oneself to the world which means

361
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,010
under your control when you want it and

362
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,780
with whatever data you believe is

363
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,730
sufficient for the operations and

364
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,510
whatever service you choose to use and

365
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:21,210
that really is freedom otherwise you

366
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,380
will be tracked and B services can be

367
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:29,850
censored and it's exceedingly dangerous

368
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,740
sorry so these are the sort of two

369
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,860
fundamental problems we have to tackle

370
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,080
one is how do we create how do we not

371
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,150
create the kinds of activities that

372
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,760
people want to do logging into things

373
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,770
paying for things without a centralized

374
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,950
I didn't provider like Facebook in the

375
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,210
middle and I hope some will talk about

376
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,120
this briefly but there was a great talk

377
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,430
about yesterday by David Stanton even

378
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,500
with that massive powerful adversaries

379
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,540
it's just the NSA can just kind of watch

380
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,720
the traffic and use that to violate

381
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:05,280
privacy so we do need some traffic tcpi

382
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,870
UDP level protection as well so the

383
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,270
centralized entity providers just to

384
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,849
repeat their own kind of attacks they

385
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,889
can use on date on ordinary people they

386
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,169
capture ID any data they know exactly

387
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,199
which services a user uses when they use

388
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,339
them they can transfer personal data

389
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,620
ideally with consent but they don't have

390
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,359
to ask for consent technically and they

391
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:26,639
can even impersonate you to other

392
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,929
service providers and they can censor

393
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,640
service providers they can prevent

394
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,000
people from logging in to service

395
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,710
providers they may not agree with

396
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,090
luckily there is technology and this is

397
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,510
the main technology I'm going to explain

398
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,220
it was created by an obscure London

399
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,910
startup I recommend looking at the wired

400
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,040
article called chain space that came out

401
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,800
of University College London and was

402
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,170
acquired by Facebook but luckily for us

403
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,470
that software was left open source and

404
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,480
the papers are all published

405
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,820
in the without patents and all that

406
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,240
stuff and it's it's a very ironic this

407
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,820
happened because the researchers that

408
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,130
were working on this were funded by you

409
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,439
know the European Commission mostly to

410
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,750
create privacy enhanced decentralized

411
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,750
technologies and cities such as

412
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,360
Barcelona and Amsterdam to enable

413
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,510
citizens to own their own data so that's

414
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,699
kind of the background of where this

415
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,408
technology came from and the particulars

416
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,299
technology some of it also came from

417
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,400
another project called next leap which I

418
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:30,770
coordinated which is sensors trying to

419
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,960
say after the Snowden revelations how

420
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,389
can we build better decentralized

421
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,070
privacy enhanced identity systems so

422
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,080
this is going to be a quick overview I'm

423
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,760
just gonna give the intuitions behind

424
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,158
the cryptography but I think you'll

425
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,700
probably get a get get something from it

426
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,230
the solutions on a very broad scale is

427
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,730
in order to in metadata collection as

428
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,650
mentioned earlier you need something

429
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,909
like tor or ideally some even better

430
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,260
such as a mixed net we're gonna focus on

431
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:59,809
authentication you want privacy enhance

432
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,010
transfer of any data under absolute user

433
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:02,690
control that's why we're gonna use

434
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,049
anonymous left indication credentials

435
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,580
and you want tokens which can basically

436
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,379
subsidize the whole system make sure

437
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,658
that's sustainable and people can do

438
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,669
transfer in a privacy way privacy dance

439
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:15,760
manner and we also want a few other

440
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,270
properties we want possibly these

441
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,669
transfers of data to be

442
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,250
cryptographically unlink able actually

443
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:25,610
anonymize we want users to be able not

444
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:28,220
only show data such as I'm 18 but also

445
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:30,020
private attributes proof that they know

446
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,809
something without revealing it such as

447
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,299
proof that I own a secret or proof that

448
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,799
I'm a member of a country citizen in

449
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,559
Europe but without revealing which

450
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,179
country and we also may want you know a

451
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,879
lot of anonymous technologies makes it

452
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,919
very hard to produce some very useful

453
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,059
applications such as for example long

454
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,950
term messaging we want a profile which

455
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,289
can receive and send messages over long

456
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,530
periods of time so we want pseudonym an

457
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:59,299
integration not just complete anonymity

458
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,980
so anonymous left indication credentials

459
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,649
have been around for a very long time

460
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,890
the initial work was of course done by

461
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:07,530
David CIAM who's one of the you know

462
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,060
fathers

463
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,070
of the modern cypherpunk movement and

464
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,570
and most the interesting work racine

465
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,100
cryptography including mixed nuts that

466
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,379
we're now finally getting to market and

467
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,939
it but what they do is a very simple

468
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,610
blinded signature scheme where you

469
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,500
basically have some credentials you

470
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,169
verify that these credentials are true

471
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,620
these attributes such as age name

472
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:31,940
citizenship and the blinding basically

473
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,989
prevents the issuer to kind of know

474
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,090
exactly what the credentials are they

475
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,550
can just show that there they have been

476
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,919
issued correctly that they are indeed

477
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,200
correct and that other service providers

478
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,730
can't verify them but the problem is

479
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,340
every time you reshow that credential

480
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,930
you allow yourself to be linked again

481
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,550
you know blind signatures you see the

482
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,560
same even if you see the same ciphertext

483
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,870
more than once you can look at the bite

484
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,750
pattern and the cipher text and link it

485
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,270
so luckily there's been some really

486
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,730
amazing work that's been a more research

487
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:05,160
papers I can possibly go into primarily

488
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,170
by yon common ish and many other people

489
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,690
talk about blinded showing which allows

490
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:12,900
multiple shows of the same credential

491
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,600
and that's really I think a wonderful

492
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,100
work but it's very complicated and we're

493
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,740
going to talk about some new work that

494
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,209
uses algebraic max which is we think

495
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,590
much more efficient but not

496
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,750
decentralized and then we're going to

497
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,750
discuss how we can make it decentralized

498
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:35,129
okay so the big picture is you have the

499
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,469
user wants to prove that they have some

500
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:41,100
attributes they get a certified

501
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:43,050
credential from what we call the issuer

502
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,000
so this is sort of a standard but we

503
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,280
would call Sigma protocol game if you're

504
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,760
familiar with cryptography you show

505
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,379
these assertions to a verifier could be

506
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,250
the third-party service providers such

507
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:58,560
as Twitter and then the verifier can for

508
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,200
example like check that these are

509
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:07,260
correct and the general intuition is

510
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:10,740
that the very unlike when I go to for

511
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:15,660
example a bar in the United States or I

512
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,100
go to vote I show you my ID card but you

513
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,990
know all you really want to know is the

514
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,060
age you instead you get my name and my

515
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,900
date of birth and my where it was born

516
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:27,300
we allow you just to show just the age

517
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:30,140
and they learn nothing else so we can

518
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,850
use max which are essentially a

519
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,820
symmetric crypto graphic authentication

520
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,280
mechanism which can guarantee integrity

521
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,340
authentication and symmetric crypto to

522
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,810
sort of make this work and a privacy

523
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,429
enhanced fashion but we need a little

524
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:51,899
bit extra so we want to be able to

525
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:53,490
effectively we have an issuer and they

526
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,880
want to be able to verify these

527
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,680
credentials are indeed correct that

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,620
they've issued them correctly there's

529
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,000
the user the prover they get the surf

530
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,639
eye credential we've seen this before

531
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,330
and they can make some assertions which

532
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:13,770
can be proven but we essentially there's

533
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,810
a secret mat key which is then used to

534
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,970
essentially Mack the credential and we

535
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:21,510
use a new cryptographic formulation

536
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:25,590
which we'll discuss right now called

537
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:27,120
algebraic max to basically make it

538
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,429
private because if you just use a normal

539
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,590
Mac it's a normal signature and you can

540
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:36,240
sort of you don't have any privacy over

541
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:38,850
the credential self algebraic max allow

542
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,880
a number of basically the way think

543
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:44,300
about is it's a normal Mac but you can

544
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,200
basically make them unlink able and

545
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,970
they're very efficient

546
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,680
just like max typically are very

547
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,840
efficient so you have efficient proofs

548
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,540
of Mac creation and efficient proofs of

549
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,340
possession and you use the possession of

550
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:00,810
the Mac as showing an attribute and the

551
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,149
issuer basically uses max is the source

552
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:06,090
signature over the attribute and you can

553
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,800
do these protocols and the clear for

554
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,870
parameters and key generation if you

555
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,820
want the whole paper that's a Sarah

556
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,979
Michael John and Melissa chase algebraic

557
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,290
max and key Vera Kate very keyed

558
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,830
verification anonymous credentials and

559
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,270
what we did is we took algebraic max and

560
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:25,080
we said let's make a privacy enhanced

561
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,110
version of Facebook Connect and we made

562
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,210
it system called unlimited ID which

563
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,699
embeds the tributes into the mac

564
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,960
messages but we want not only to

565
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,580
mitigate we don't want people to be able

566
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,880
to stay

567
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:40,250
yes you know my name is my ages but we

568
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,010
also want private attributes possession

569
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,250
of keys for example possession of keys

570
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:48,919
which could access a bank account which

571
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:53,779
could access a financial transaction and

572
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:58,899
so we take this construction embed it in

573
00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:02,360
the previous setup we saw and then using

574
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:03,879
the issuing authority you kind of run it

575
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,100
like you wouldn't run it with a normal

576
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,649
Mac based credential so you you know you

577
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,070
you ask or prove er yeah make sure sign

578
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:17,408
off the fact I'm of age x5 a European

579
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:20,658
citizen whatever you get that credential

580
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,039
the algebraic Matt can't sort of with

581
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,539
over non zero zero knowledge

582
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,860
non-negative zero knowledge proof scan

583
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:29,779
hide the private attributes the Mac

584
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,399
prevents you from just forging it from

585
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,529
just making it up so if something third

586
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:37,309
party has signed off on it but you could

587
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:41,450
use an anonymous channel to basically

588
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:43,840
have these algebric max verified and

589
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,149
that's kind of one way to create a

590
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,039
centralized version of OAuth which has

591
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:51,949
privacy that's the unlimited ID

592
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,919
technique and you can do all sorts of

593
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,409
great things you can rate limit you can

594
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,340
check for duplication a lot of these

595
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:03,950
things you can do is by simply embedding

596
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,620
various hashes strings proof of

597
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:09,049
knowledge of strings and keys into the

598
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,229
credential itself and so for example

599
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:14,149
this prevents reuse so you can sort of

600
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,500
say hey I can't just keep showing you

601
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:17,299
the credential multiple time family show

602
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,710
it to you once which sounds were silly

603
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,600
but it actually could be very useful

604
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,429
that credential was for example sending

605
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,129
money because then you don't want to you

606
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,010
want to say hey yes I got a bank account

607
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,350
the spank account has let's say 30 euros

608
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,799
in it and then I send the anonymous

609
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:36,918
credential to a verifier and I ship them

610
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:40,549
the money they don't know no one who's

611
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,529
watching can figure it out your bank has

612
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:45,980
verified that you have 30 euros your

613
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:47,350
account that 30 euros then trans first a

614
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,600
service provider

615
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,100
but the service provider can then check

616
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,959
with the bank to make sure that 30 euros

617
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,810
is still there but you can still

618
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,190
maintain your privacy so this very good

619
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,169
neat tricks is algebraic max which

620
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,300
unfortunately do not have time to go

621
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:06,760
into but we're interested not just in a

622
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,850
privacy enhanced alternative to Facebook

623
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,070
Connect but a decentralized and privacy

624
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,330
enhance a version of Facebook Connect so

625
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,120
we want something that's a little bit

626
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,649
more complicated what we want to have we

627
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,149
don't want to have trusted a single

628
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,880
third party even if they don't know

629
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,250
anything about us to be able to hold all

630
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,860
hold our keys so we have a issuing

631
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:30,580
authority multiples you see multiple

632
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,060
sort of Bob's multiple bananas this is

633
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,490
in the screen we get a threshold

634
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,370
signature with multiple signing keys and

635
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,560
then we kind of get that credential we

636
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,409
merge the credential and then we can

637
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,740
show that credential to third parties

638
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:49,600
service providers so I'm going to show a

639
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,030
little bit of code about how that works

640
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,270
so we have this code for this and I'm

641
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,590
gonna explain it on github but let me

642
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,460
just show you a little video while we

643
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:05,199
have a second so this is what's called a

644
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:07,120
NIM wallet you can it in bed even

645
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,050
currency which we call NIMS

646
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,959
into this wallet and then you basically

647
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:17,950
this is why this step takes a while you

648
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,450
can ask different validators to validate

649
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,640
that you have that money in your wallet

650
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:26,590
so this is like three of five validators

651
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,210
or 60 of 100 or we even get kind of

652
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:32,740
pretty good performance when you have up

653
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:35,890
to 10,000 validators when that validator

654
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,500
confirms that transaction so it confirms

655
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,540
it on a essentially a blockchain you get

656
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,370
you can type in how much how much you

657
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,170
want you get that in a credential you

658
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,199
can embed other stuff such as name and

659
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,510
age or whatever else you want and then

660
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,220
you send it and this is the real trick

661
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,680
you make it privacy enhanced by

662
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,140
unlinking it so you can see there's a

663
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,670
rear an demise button you can click on

664
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,920
that button and the cipher text itself

665
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,240
re randomized this by simply taking the

666
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,790
existing cipher text and taking

667
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,390
to another exponent and boom you've just

668
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:10,389
created a unlink able decentralized

669
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,590
privacy enhanced transaction and you can

670
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,680
send the money to whatever service

671
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,189
provider you want so they go back to the

672
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,190
slides

673
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,550
so the codes a GPL free software online

674
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,230
would love to have people play with it

675
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,810
but just to give your intuition for the

676
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,580
tricks that we use it's very similar to

677
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,929
algebraic case but there's a few

678
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,970
different things going on and you should

679
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,790
read the coconut paper talk to Mustafa

680
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:44,420
al Bassam if he's here if you can see

681
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,610
him around in the audience you embed the

682
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,580
attribute says commitments sort of

683
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,929
standard Peterson style commits like I

684
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,120
said earlier you can use non directive

685
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,910
zero knowledge proof if you want private

686
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,250
attributes and then you have pairing

687
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:01,790
based elliptic curve cryptography which

688
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,660
helps allow the signature itself to be

689
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,030
reran demise

690
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,410
so you package up your commits into an

691
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,430
encrypted package using el-gamal

692
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,070
encryption because you can then re

693
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,650
randomize it ship it up the validators

694
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:15,080
they validate it let's say three or five

695
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:20,390
validate it you ship it back and you

696
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:22,399
have some new functions so while you can

697
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:26,480
get partial credentials from an issuer a

698
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,220
validator so to speak the user merges

699
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,890
these credentials together they don't

700
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,680
have the any third party do it for them

701
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,210
and that creates a full credential that

702
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,310
embeds all the information for identity

703
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,740
they need which can be shipped to verify

704
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,200
on a service and as I showed in a demo

705
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,120
they can then the user is under control

706
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,160
re randomization so at any time they

707
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,709
want the unlinking transaction they want

708
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,220
no one to connect their validation and

709
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,140
they're issuing they just basically hit

710
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,060
the realization button simple

711
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,640
explanation and they can reran demise

712
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:00,770
the signature itself and the two other

713
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,450
tricks the tricks well-known tricks

714
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:05,120
which essentially allow this to work as

715
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:07,970
you use threshold cryptography to

716
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,649
achieve decentralization and order to

717
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,210
achieve verifiability because you have

718
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,620
to the people who get these credentials

719
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,810
they have to verify that they're really

720
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,300
the the really valid that they actually

721
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,980
you know the someone actually saw

722
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,570
something that said you're eighteen or

723
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,430
you actually do have this amount money

724
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,370
in your bank account you can basically

725
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:27,860
use the hashing trick over the secrets

726
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,929
similar to identity based encryption so

727
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,030
make a hash which in anyone can check

728
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,680
which can be publicly published so we

729
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,820
built this whole giant system which I

730
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,879
actually just demoed to you

731
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,158
- the mix net component already taking

732
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:43,408
essentially some sort of nem some sort

733
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,210
of token shipping it around

734
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:46,999
embedding all sorts of attributes and

735
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,879
anonymous authentication provider

736
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:52,559
credential you take you can have third

737
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:54,209
party sign off of them you can create

738
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,580
these attributes yourself and make them

739
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,970
self sovereign so you can sign them ship

740
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,739
them up through from - validator the

741
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,179
validator doesn't know what credentials

742
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:04,200
you're you you're getting a signed off

743
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,210
on they don't know where you're going

744
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,919
with them they just said yep looks valid

745
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,710
someone signed that I don't really care

746
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,479
we trust a user here they ship it back

747
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,009
depends on the kind of attribute you

748
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:15,539
want you can then ship it through

749
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:17,580
something like a mixed net or a tour and

750
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:19,529
anonymous communication channel bring

751
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,629
the link ability on the timing aspects

752
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:22,950
and for various other metadata the

753
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:24,840
service provider can then check the

754
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,460
credential go back to the blockchain

755
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,080
make sure that there's been no double

756
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,759
spending and then you can both do

757
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,289
one-time attribute shows for essentially

758
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,479
financial transactions or other kinds of

759
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:39,169
one-time sort of things and also multi

760
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:41,519
shows for things like age date whatever

761
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:42,869
your name or you we really want to tell

762
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,869
multiple people you can just do it an

763
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:49,019
unlimited amount of time and you know

764
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:50,869
because we're not using full ZK snarks

765
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,889
we're using these kind of very

766
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:55,349
specialized not interactive zero

767
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:58,859
knowledge proof we get pretty linear

768
00:32:55,349 --> 00:33:00,950
scaling things operate on link ability

769
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,999
can take place in two milliseconds and

770
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:06,359
verification you know tends to be around

771
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:07,409
50 it's a bit more expensive a procedure

772
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,320
because you have to check all the

773
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:12,840
secrets and you can see the more and

774
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,369
more people you add to the system it of

775
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,439
course gets slower because there's more

776
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:18,539
more things to check but it's it's

777
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,859
slower in a linear fashion so we think

778
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:24,239
that's pretty cool and I think we won't

779
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,918
really go into this but we're really

780
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:27,899
thinking really hard about rewards and

781
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,809
how that works how we can actually make

782
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:33,238
sure that to make privacy enhances

783
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:36,239
services really sustain a sustainable

784
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:38,669
surveillance capitalism is obviously not

785
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:40,200
sustainable and neither are US

786
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:42,359
government grants to tour and other

787
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,159
projects we really need to be able for

788
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,199
privacy enhancing technologies to be

789
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,249
able to plug into something that looks

790
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,470
like Facebook Connect

791
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:51,900
that's decentralized that defit

792
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,880
user privacy and then lets them get paid

793
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,730
in a way where they don't have to

794
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,950
essentially hold user data for example

795
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,440
if I'm whole if I run a VPN service I

796
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,760
don't want to have anyone's credit card

797
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,750
information I don't want anymore

798
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,120
personal data

799
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,040
ideally 0 I just want to provide a VPN

800
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,609
service and get paid it into the month

801
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,259
and no there's real users coming through

802
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:15,569
and there's tons of other use cases

803
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,369
outside of VPNs one which I think and

804
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,020
you know the European Commission worked

805
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:20,790
on attribute-based credentials and fun

806
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,399
tool all this for Identity Management to

807
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,840
make an alternative to Facebook Connect

808
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,580
but there's also I think there's a very

809
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,550
powerful use case around secure

810
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,960
messaging you know when you're used for

811
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,599
example signal you have a phone number

812
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,359
you have contacts all this stuff should

813
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,389
be embeddable within a privacy enhanced

814
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:41,639
credential and we're we have some

815
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,169
software i've recommend taking a look at

816
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,639
status which actually is decentralized

817
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,848
which tries to provide some of the same

818
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,129
capability a signal that this software

819
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:51,540
should be embeddable and some of the

820
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,279
newer standards coming out to try to

821
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,619
make open standards that have better

822
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,330
scalability than the signal protocol in

823
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:02,670
terms of large group messaging and to be

824
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,049
an actual IETF open standard and these

825
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,359
kind of standards because they're built

826
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,490
to support things like Facebook Connect

827
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,069
is the fundamental identity system we

828
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,410
want to make sure we can slot in sort of

829
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,200
decentralized privacy enhancing

830
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,149
credentials into these kinds of

831
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,200
next-generation messaging protocols so

832
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,480
I'd recommend anyone interested in

833
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,020
messaging check out the IETF message

834
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,220
layer security work I won't go into mix

835
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,330
nets because running out of time but

836
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,560
again there was a great talking

837
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,869
yesterday just check that talk out

838
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,099
essentially it is possible to obfuscate

839
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:37,140
metadata and hook that to a credential

840
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,670
this is all the wonderful people who've

841
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,060
been working on the on the project

842
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:44,430
Claudia Diaz Anya Dave who actually left

843
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,710
Libre and is now joined us

844
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,779
Jared Andrew who's done a lot of the

845
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,550
hard work on the code and I would really

846
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,119
recommend you know if you want to get

847
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,730
involved

848
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,589
everything is on github I want to review

849
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,849
some of the papers that you may want to

850
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:59,070
take a look at if you're interested in

851
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:00,720
deep diving so again the keywords or

852
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,030
chain space a lot of the code is on

853
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,959
their website lots of good links

854
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,760
even though they were purchased by

855
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,310
Facebook there's still website and the

856
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,080
code still there for early work on

857
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,549
Thomas authentication credentials the

858
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,069
really classic paper that goes over

859
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,260
Schnoor signatures all the way from 1991

860
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,450
efficient signature generation by smart

861
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,640
cards and then the kind of use of this

862
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,310
and well ended up being Microsoft

863
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,440
passport by stefan braun and the real

864
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,990
core paper for cocoanut credentials is

865
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,150
called coconut that gives you the

866
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,979
decentralization of privacy but you're

867
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,110
interested in the algebraic Mac work

868
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,000
which allows to have centralized privacy

869
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,590
enhanced identity it could be useful for

870
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,120
some use cases like government someplace

871
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:41,760
where you really need to really a lot of

872
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,109
speed a lot of transactions you can look

873
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,860
it up my work on unlimited ID and that's

874
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:52,350
it I do want to there was a lot of

875
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,880
information at once by just wanted I'm

876
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,589
just gonna reiterate the fundamental

877
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,450
points and the fundamental points are

878
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:00,750
this that everyone's very concerned

879
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:03,810
about currency but identity is the real

880
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:06,240
currency and any plays for new global

881
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:08,880
cryptocurrencies schemes are effectively

882
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,250
plays to make global ID na systems we

883
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,110
already have the world's largest IT

884
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:17,090
system operational right now bigger than

885
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:19,620
any nation-state ran by Facebook but

886
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,750
luckily did 20 years of research we have

887
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,299
the technology to build alternate if we

888
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,460
even have working code we just have more

889
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,320
people be aware of the problem build

890
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,720
this into their own apps and work with

891
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,640
us to make more efficient more private

892
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,680
into more decent choice alternative

893
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,859
because to be honest I don't think

894
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,799
anyone wants live in a society where

895
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:44,010
single Authority can watch all your

896
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,350
transactions and have the control over

897
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,780
both your financial transactions and the

898
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:51,210
most intimate details of your life we

899
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,160
need to have privacy enhanced decent

900
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,980
choice alternatives and I welcome you to

901
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,950
just join us and help make this true

902
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:03,950
make this reality fight back against

903
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,950
Libre so any questions

904
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,670
thank you

905
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:15,859
that was emotional but I think that's

906
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:19,519
really really well furred we need

907
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:21,819
engagement we need to fight okay do we

908
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,819
have questions

909
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:36,259
Danlos that I mean biases leashed just

910
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:38,720
Minds acknowledging a question about the

911
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,059
Libra basically when everybody puts

912
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,368
money there they pile up a lot of cash

913
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:45,559
so it's kind of a like a debit card

914
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,920
I couldn't found any information about

915
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,510
what happens with the money while after

916
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,980
you give it to Facebook and before you

917
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:56,299
spend it for something yeah so this is

918
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,180
something which there hasn't been too

919
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:00,559
much work on and the public because

920
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,720
Facebook is published very little about

921
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,400
this that being said it would likely

922
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,459
work as a fractional reserve banking

923
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,890
system so that when you give control

924
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:14,269
over sort of you know let's say you get

925
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:16,848
a I give Facebook $50 50 euros they can

926
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,140
then you know have that under their

927
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:19,609
control on or at least the Libra

928
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,288
Association control and then real end it

929
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:24,769
out there so that it will effectively

930
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:26,660
lead to mass capital accumulation by

931
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:28,578
liberal Libre Association if you add

932
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,379
that by one third of humanity being

933
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,849
stuck under Facebook Connect that's a

934
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,059
whole lot of cash that's essentially a

935
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,670
parallel corporate payment and banking

936
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,690
infrastructure which can rival

937
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,279
traditional banking structures and

938
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,700
that's on some level very cyberpunk

939
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:46,250
another level very terrifying okay we

940
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,740
have one more question we just have one

941
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:54,049
more question I'm here afterwards yeah

942
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:57,700
so I have any thoughts on decentralized

943
00:39:54,049 --> 00:40:00,470
identity providers so would they verify

944
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,629
government credentials or anything or

945
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:05,328
are there different ideas about that to

946
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,859
do that decentralized yeah so what we

947
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,390
tried to do if I can get back to the

948
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:11,390
picture is we tried to build a system

949
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:13,220
where we disintermediate centralized

950
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,379
providers from validation and

951
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,660
verification so oh there it is

952
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,420
so you can see on in this diagram

953
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,808
instead

954
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,920
- okay the you your identity party it

955
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:24,299
could be the German government which is

956
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,680
big centralized entity they might sign

957
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,779
off on just your age or just your

958
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,038
passport and you can make up some other

959
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:31,170
stuff and you can work these together

960
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,490
and have them be validated in a

961
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,950
decentralized way so we don't think

962
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:38,240
they're incompatible okay thank you so

963
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:41,038
much you will be here for questions and

964
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,529
thank you for watching please wash your

965
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,779
hands take your stuff with you and don't

966
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:47,030
leave any garbage and a big applause for

967
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:51,299
