Geko goose Alex and George they're gonna

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,560
tour and improvement censorship

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:32,250
circumvention please listen to the

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:41,199
updates from the onion that's your stage

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:41,769
thank you hello everybody my name is

8
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:44,140
goose

9
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:46,930
I'm from the Tor project English is not

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,930
my first language so maybe you are going

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,290
to learn a little bit about Portuguese

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,440
today

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,809
sure so we want to talk a little bit

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,599
about tour and what we are working in

15
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,940
the last three months in the year so

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,339
first thing about tour is start the free

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,039
software so you can download tor you can

18
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:09,190
check the source code and everything and

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,170
it is very important to have a free

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,810
software project because you can inspect

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,150
the code and can check the code the

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,330
second thing is about tor is about is an

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,390
open network so you can grab the source

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:25,450
code and be part of the tor network show

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,860
at the moment we have like 6000 relays

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:32,860
so it is servers around the world and

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,930
they are all run by volunteers and why

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,760
we are going to your store basically we

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,310
are going to start to mitigate against

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,890
online tracking and against surveillance

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,880
against censorship and it should be safe

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:49,930
aligned and tor is a non-profit based in

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:53,979
the US so many further we don't live in

34
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:57,070
US but are the headquarters of tor is

35
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,800
based in Seattle and how do we spell

36
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:03,699
tour is like that and it's not our caps

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,520
we change that in the last few years

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,030
it's not more toward the Onion Routing

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,180
it's just or easy for us and we are

40
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,239
organizing different teams I'm part of

41
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,290
the community team and we also have the

42
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,710
anti anti censorship team applications

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,200
fundraising matrix

44
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:30,170
to work see that the main UX and

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:32,869
research and when we talk about all we

46
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,329
are talking about network that is used

47
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,790
by between two millions and eight

48
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,370
minutes of people and we have just

49
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,769
numbers because first we don't track the

50
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,020
users so we don't actually know how many

51
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,900
people are connecting the Tor network so

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,270
these numbers are really based on two

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:56,240
different methodologies to study the Tor

54
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:58,460
network and how that works basically we

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,680
have just network of Tor servers around

56
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,200
the world and when you want to enter

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,960
your website you're going to access

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,940
three servers in the Tor network so

59
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,830
you're you're not going to access

60
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,600
directly the website your traffic is

61
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,760
going to pass through three servers

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,859
around the road this server that they

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,859
are run by all volunteers

64
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:31,339
and at the moment we have the network is

65
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,890
growing so if we if we have older users

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,000
here in the past years we had a very

67
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:40,220
slow connection using tor and nowadays

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,490
connections improving as well is much

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,440
more faster nowadays and it's because we

70
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:53,350
have more faster relays and more faster

71
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:57,050
servers and about community in the last

72
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,900
years we have been working in doing

73
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,580
trainings in the global south so for

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,520
those that you are not familiar with

75
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,650
trainings basically is the opportunity

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,750
to meet the users and to talk about tor

77
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,540
and not only about tour but about

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,410
privacy about security so we have been

79
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,858
doing digital training security

80
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:21,469
workshops with human right defenders in

81
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:24,770
the global south so in the last six

82
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,580
months we traveled to six countries like

83
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,549
Colombia Kenya India Indonesia and other

84
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,840
countries

85
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:37,080
and we did 45 workshops and each each

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,679
workshop it usually takes like three

87
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,568
hours so it's not just like oh you're

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,419
going to start our browser and that's it

89
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:47,009
bye what is about what kind of questions

90
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,719
we have about privacy what kind of

91
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,900
questions we'll have about security and

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,470
if tor cannot help you what we can do

93
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,929
for you

94
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,780
what kind of others face of the solution

95
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,080
we can present you so we have been doing

96
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,719
this work in the last month and we are

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:11,669
going to do more more tour trainings in

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:13,770
in the next month and another thing that

99
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,729
we are doing we release the new website

100
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:20,430
so now it's localized it as you can see

101
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,090
it's not in English anymore only in

102
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,690
English anymore

103
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,599
we have been Jesus top priority on tour

104
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,389
we need to have mod users and we need to

105
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,599
achieve this population that don't don't

106
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,940
speak in English so toward is translated

107
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:39,270
in many languages like in 12 languages

108
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,310
languages so you can access the tour web

109
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,460
page and you can change the language for

110
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,529
what your preferred language so here we

111
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,219
have toured the main website translated

112
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,800
to Spanish now Vega controversy dad is

113
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:56,490
proud of liberty maintained he uses me

114
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,490
is in Jesus my Spanish port we know it's

115
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,889
not a real Spanish and we also have

116
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,460
other portals that we are working we

117
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,300
have the support portal it's a portal to

118
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,549
helped our users and we are working in

119
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,500
the community portal so we are going to

120
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,669
have the training slides so you can

121
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,819
download then you can help your

122
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,520
community and also we are going to have

123
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,430
the relay operators documentation there

124
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,948
and also how to localize the website and

125
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,900
other things and the next step we are

126
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:31,139
going to develop we are going to start

127
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,419
to code the new developers web page that

128
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,819
we don't have now it was all mixes in

129
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:40,680
the older part oh and you are we are

130
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:42,940
building different portals for that and

131
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,180
another thing that we are work

132
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,640
King is a is the duck is a duck socket

133
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,890
on so because we are moving a lot of

134
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,860
documentation in splitting different

135
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,310
websites we notice that many of these

136
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,290
documentation is old so we need help to

137
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,900
improve the documentation and to fix

138
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,450
that so in the first week of September

139
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,770
we are going to do dark a documentation

140
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,539
hackathon is open for for all and more

141
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,560
details about that you can check in the

142
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,170
blog in the tar project and basically we

143
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,810
we already have tickets about what you

144
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:22,350
want to change so we need you need to

145
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,950
subscribe in the in the hackathon and

146
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:30,750
help us on that and people that they the

147
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:33,570
top contributors will receive an award

148
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:43,150
and that's it

149
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:45,250
thanks guys so hi i'm keiko i'm working

150
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,640
on the applications team and they're

151
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:52,030
mostly on tor browser stuff as tor

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,330
browser is our largest application i

153
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,979
think it's smarter spend some time on

154
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,960
what we did in the last couple of month

155
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:05,500
and what is yet to come in the next

156
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:07,390
couple of months so one big milestone we

157
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,900
had a couple of months earlier when

158
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:13,740
releasing tor browser 8.5 which brought

159
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,679
for the first time it were also to

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,690
android devices the nice folks from the

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,450
chorion project had grappled with the

162
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,360
situation that they were there was no

163
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,360
real privacy problem for the Android

164
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,560
device and develop orfox but we finally

165
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:36,190
were able to take them off and take off

166
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:41,199
the work for them and deliver a proper

167
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:43,479
to a browser to Android users and as you

168
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,670
can see this is not not just a copy from

169
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,300
the desktop version in case you already

170
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,290
tried the desktop version it's together

171
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,969
with our UX team a new design for

172
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,189
specific for the Android platform

173
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,550
and as it has been a huge collaborative

174
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:04,060
effort from different teams within the

175
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:08,699
Tor project to get this project going

176
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:12,579
and having a tow processor for mobile

177
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:17,069
that's not been the only user interface

178
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:21,969
improvements we made for tor browser 8.5

179
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:23,469
we have as well we done our toolbar

180
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,850
which is a pretty important thing in a

181
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,329
browser because you have all these

182
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:33,069
shortcuts on them and see easily status

183
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:35,920
or different extensions and stuff you

184
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:38,829
have installed so if you compare the the

185
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,459
upper one the upper toolbar this is from

186
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,800
tor browser

187
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:47,529
8 and the below one is from tor browser

188
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,050
8.5 you see that remove the the icons in

189
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:52,930
the in the upper right those were from

190
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,420
from extensions we ship with tor browser

191
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,819
which is no script and a sheep is

192
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,620
everywhere and it's pretty confusing to

193
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:02,529
users what are they supposed to do with

194
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,079
those icons if you click on them you're

195
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,779
getting even more confused because then

196
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,000
you're already in the settings dialog

197
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,819
and you don't know as a normal user what

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,089
you're supposed to do there so it's not

199
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:18,490
really informative having those icons

200
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,759
there and they are just taking precious

201
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,730
space on your toolbar so remove them if

202
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,639
there are experience users with this

203
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,980
with some use cases which are not

204
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,949
covered by the defaults it's easy for

205
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:36,970
them to drag them on the toolbar again

206
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:40,209
and using them as they various term and

207
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:43,240
why we are doing we moved the top button

208
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:46,420
icon to the right and added a shield

209
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,019
icon which is meant for giving easy

210
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,029
access to the security settings which

211
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,720
allow you to make some trade-offs

212
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:58,000
between improved security in your tor

213
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,290
browser and features on the web which

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,149
which could be dangerous in some

215
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,599
contexts and another big feature here is

216
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,230
that your have

217
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,900
the state of your security settings with

218
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,570
will in your toolbar you don't have to

219
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:18,500
click and in two different menus anymore

220
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:22,070
to see what's a security setting your

221
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,740
currently and are on well that's been

222
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:30,650
another important collaborative effort

223
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:32,690
with the UX team and that's not just to

224
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,770
give you a pretty user interface there's

225
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:39,230
a deeper point here in the sense that

226
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:41,540
you get more users if you provide them

227
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,800
with a user interface they are used to

228
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:49,550
and they make less mistakes if they use

229
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:53,540
those user interfaces then those your

230
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,800
ship and are not really in line with

231
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,230
what they are expecting when they are

232
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,599
using a browser for instance and more

233
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,700
users in turn means it's good for your

234
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,080
anonymity set for your anonymity Network

235
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:09,710
because there's a larger crowd which you

236
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:12,500
can hide and as a as a user so a key

237
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,290
point to take away here is the usability

238
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,500
improvements we are doing and which are

239
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,959
yet to come are not just meant to give

240
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,550
you eye candy they are really an

241
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:32,060
integral part in providing anonymity to

242
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:35,449
as much people as possible so what's

243
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:39,229
what's up next so up next is to a

244
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:43,000
browser 9 which is supposed to be based

245
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:46,190
on Firefox 68 years or which is a

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,360
special flavor of Firefox so some of you

247
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:53,600
might know that Firefox is coming in at

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,730
least pencil Harmon how one counts at

249
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,110
least two flavors there's an old one

250
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,500
where you have like Firefox 68 69 70 and

251
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,610
so on and then there's the special one

252
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,920
originally made for our enterprise

253
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:10,490
environments which which are struggling

254
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,380
with updating their Firefox user base so

255
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,550
quickly because those releases get out

256
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:19,250
every six to eight weeks so Mozilla made

257
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,650
a special series for those needs

258
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,520
which means that you only get security

259
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:29,930
updates every six to eight weeks and

260
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:34,670
there's one big update you made you make

261
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,349
like once a year and on this train two

262
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:42,290
browsers based on because we have to

263
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:44,990
redo our patches which are like 200 150

264
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:51,199
and doing this every six to eight eight

265
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:55,220
weeks seem to be infeasible yet so this

266
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,720
is a big new thing which means that tor

267
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,080
browser 9 will be based on the new

268
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,110
Firefox is or we're happy improved user

269
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,090
interface in the browser meaning that

270
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,760
it's easier to select breeches from it

271
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:10,850
in the browser it's more integrated with

272
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:15,350
the network settings as it's right now

273
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:17,330
you will get a easy access to new

274
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,390
features in the toolbar which means like

275
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:23,570
new identity which gives you if you

276
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:26,090
press this button a clean slate a clean

277
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,010
new session which you can start serving

278
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,450
without bothering whether as the cookies

279
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,930
and things left from the previous

280
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:38,450
session and this is released property

281
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:40,880
released in October later this year so a

282
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:44,720
bit longer in the in the future we plan

283
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,810
to move away from the firefox or to the

284
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,840
regular one so i said there are some

285
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,880
some benefits from being on the firefox

286
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,520
is our Twain like we don't have to

287
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,650
rebase our patches every six to eight

288
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,240
weeks and have the quality control which

289
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,540
comes with that every six to eight weeks

290
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,880
but there are disadvantages as well one

291
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,980
of those is that there is no ease or

292
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,410
from mobile and as you recall we have a

293
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,600
mobile browser for Android now so we

294
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,750
have to do something here and the plan

295
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,580
is to first start moving away from these

296
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,460
are trying to the regular file for

297
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,570
stories for mobile test this figure out

298
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,080
what we need and

299
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:32,820
what is probably needs to get fixed in

300
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:36,150
our processes and then we plan to move

301
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,450
to this new away from is our for desktop

302
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,880
as well because there is an argument to

303
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,160
be made that being on the Firefox is our

304
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,930
it's not giving you all the security

305
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,810
improvements you want to have so

306
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:53,040
Mozilla's policy right now is

307
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:55,219
backporting just high security backs in

308
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,500
critical bug fixes but there are

309
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,090
sometimes a ton of moderate bug fixes we

310
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,460
might want to have a store browser use

311
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:07,490
as well and we want to have those too

312
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,870
but without without Mozilla noticing

313
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,700
notifying us that there is this kind of

314
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:17,130
stuff we want a back port because you

315
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:19,200
might miss things and there's an

316
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,890
additional argument to be made that in

317
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,890
general this kind of is our series or

318
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:28,380
not as secure as the regular ones

319
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,819
because you don't have so many people

320
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,530
looking at the East our code anymore

321
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,350
because everyone is just looking at the

322
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,959
latest one so there's there are bigger

323
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:41,130
chances that you miss a severe box and

324
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,780
those ears are serious and we will get

325
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:49,340
improved usability and performance

326
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:51,750
improvements quicker and this aims at

327
00:16:49,340 --> 00:17:01,050
retaining users and getting more users

328
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:04,740
to a tor browser so thanks hello there

329
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:07,589
I'm George and together with Alex over

330
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,150
there we're working on the network team

331
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:14,819
of tor the network team is basically the

332
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,920
team which is responsible for like

333
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,560
safekeeping the Tor network kind of

334
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,220
writing the code that implements the Tor

335
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:26,579
protocol and kind of making sure that

336
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:31,100
the network is healthy and the protocol

337
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:33,600
is secure and that the code is not a

338
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,659
huge spaghetti mass

339
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,209
and we're basically working on a huge

340
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,580
codebase the tour code base it's written

341
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:47,070
in C and we have also started doing

342
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:49,799
stuff in rust and right now I'm gonna

343
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,439
talk to you about the work we did over

344
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,970
the past year and after this I'm going

345
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,650
to talk to you about the work we're

346
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:01,650
gonna be doing next so one cool thing we

347
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,830
did about a year ago last summer is that

348
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:08,640
we released the tool for onion services

349
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:12,120
and also clients which is a Python

350
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,909
program which you can enable and it will

351
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,120
give you advanced protection against

352
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:22,140
attacks like guard discovery and various

353
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,870
kind of like traffic analysis attacks in

354
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,150
particular you can get it from github

355
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,389
and enable it and your onion service or

356
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:33,210
client and it will try to block certain

357
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,760
attacks and also give you like warnings

358
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,700
if it sees certain kinds of like

359
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,100
suspicious patterns it's still an

360
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,590
experimental thing and I asked you to

361
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,289
install it if you care about these

362
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,928
security improvements and it's mostly

363
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:51,030
like an experiment that if we see if we

364
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:56,070
see it working well we will eventually

365
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:59,399
put things into upstream tour so that's

366
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,408
a cool security thing we did so another

367
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,240
thing that's been happening particularly

368
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:08,850
this year is that like very certain

369
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,580
denial of service attacks going on on

370
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,500
the network right now we don't know the

371
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,230
exact nature of them given that we're

372
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,140
like anonymity network but what we know

373
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,080
is that people are attacking each other

374
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,650
and particularly onion services by

375
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,980
pretty much spamming them with requests

376
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:32,220
and this is causing lots of chaos on the

377
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,559
network and it has two effects one

378
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,419
effect is damaging the network because

379
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:42,149
all this traffic is causing too much

380
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:45,210
like activity and overloading the relays

381
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,580
and the relays drop stuff and they retry

382
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,130
and like a whole circle of of chaos

383
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,330
circus so this is one thing and the

384
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,330
other is that the services are

385
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,039
unavailable so since the start of this

386
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,830
year we've been looking into this and

387
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,480
doing tests and trying to figure out

388
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,480
defenses and we have done a pretty good

389
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,210
job but like kind of like improving the

390
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,370
situation of damage on the network and

391
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:14,909
by doing like rate-limiting or blocking

392
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:17,520
one-hop requests we are kind of much

393
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:20,730
more gentle to the network now under

394
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,070
attack scenarios and we're also kind of

395
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,890
looking into like improvements that

396
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,658
would allow services to have better

397
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,409
availability when they're under attack

398
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:35,429
but this is a pretty hard thing to do

399
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:37,350
and an anonymous network because like in

400
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:39,270
the normal internet you have companies

401
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,939
like CloudFlare which will get like

402
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:46,279
million dollars and they basically do

403
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,799
denial of service um protection using

404
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,320
captures or like reputation based stuff

405
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,179
and in tour we don't have reputation

406
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,649
because it's like anonymous so we don't

407
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,850
have much memory in the network so it's

408
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:03,479
it's a hard job

409
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:05,959
like like distinguishing the good

410
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,210
clients from the bad we have a few ideas

411
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,789
particularly application level stuff but

412
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,919
if you if you're in this like business

413
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:19,649
and you have ideas on how to move

414
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:21,510
forward please come and see us so

415
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:26,459
another cool thing that's happening is

416
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:29,039
that like a few years ago a research

417
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:33,710
project came out which is called WTF pod

418
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:37,770
and it's supposed to protect tor tor tor

419
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,380
clients from certain websites

420
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:43,799
fingerprinting attacks or other types of

421
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,289
traffic analyses and what this research

422
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:49,080
project was doing is introducing padding

423
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:53,100
which is fake traffic into the circuit

424
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,809
so by adding some sort of smart padding

425
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,939
on the circles you could kind of make

426
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,430
things blend more

427
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,520
together and kind of like confuse the

428
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:04,850
adversary into not knowing what's going

429
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:09,320
on so we went ahead and implemented

430
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:13,790
these like adaptive configurable padding

431
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:17,139
thing into tor and it's enabled right

432
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:20,330
now since like a few months ago

433
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,550
basically what's going on is that we

434
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,350
have enabled two padding machines

435
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,930
they're basically like state machines

436
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,459
that kind of specify how padding should

437
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:34,340
be done and their aim is to like

438
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,410
obfuscate whether an onion service

439
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,780
client client who visits an onion

440
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,870
service is actually visiting onion

441
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:45,830
services or doing real trouble real like

442
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,350
website traffic and we're still looking

443
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:52,010
into this because this like blending in

444
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,949
with other circuits is kind of hard in

445
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,720
such a chaotic environment but we're

446
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,150
doing research and we have like

447
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:05,120
motivated more researchers into into

448
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:08,150
using this this framework we've also

449
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,540
been working on improving the mobile

450
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,080
support this means that like we have

451
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,590
better integration with Android now

452
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,370
we're better

453
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,080
we now you can built or as a library and

454
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,020
you can like integrate it easier with

455
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,540
third-party applications and we have

456
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,760
also introduced like a dormant mode

457
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,700
which is like a special mode the tour

458
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,740
goes in when it it's not used and it

459
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,150
means like relax and stop like using

460
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:41,420
bandwidth or battery and basically like

461
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,670
if you if you have tor deactivated or

462
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,820
like on your mobile and you forgot about

463
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,980
it it's not gonna like spam the network

464
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,570
with requests just gonna like relax a

465
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:56,480
bit and when you need it next it's going

466
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:57,710
to activate again so now I'm gonna talk

467
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,920
to you about the things that we have

468
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,760
planned for the future particularly this

469
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,760
upcoming year

470
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,300
so one huge project that is happening on

471
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,620
tour and also know like a whole

472
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:13,250
project-level and not just on the

473
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,979
network team is that there is lots of

474
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,130
people and projects and browsers and

475
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,960
whatnot that are interested in like

476
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:25,070
playing with tor and integrating it into

477
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,590
their product and they want some sort of

478
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,360
guarantee the tour is gonna work under

479
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:33,080
different scenarios and under different

480
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,600
level of users and all that and right

481
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,840
now our metrics and our performance

482
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,260
evaluations are kind of hacky let's say

483
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,970
so one big thing we are doing and we are

484
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,370
applying for funding for this and trying

485
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,070
to like go serious in this is take a

486
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,199
look in performance in a serious way and

487
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,510
try to understand what kind of

488
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,360
performance currently tour provides and

489
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,850
what kind of performance currently users

490
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,280
expect and how to improve this and how

491
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:04,280
to like measure this over time based on

492
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,740
events and how many users getting and a

493
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:11,000
new browser user store how does that

494
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:14,270
affect performance and we're also like

495
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,390
planning to play with for example moving

496
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:20,480
to a Datagram transport and practicing

497
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,940
other types of congestion control or we

498
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,150
have implemented a new bandwidth scanner

499
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:31,370
which is basically like measures how

500
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:32,720
much bandwidth it really has and we use

501
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,510
this for load balancing but we're

502
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,150
experimenting with new ones to see how

503
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,290
that works out and in general we expect

504
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,330
that this is something that is going to

505
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,430
take lots of our time in the future to

506
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,070
kind of be able to provide a more

507
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:50,480
consistent and scalable tour in the

508
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:53,960
future and also we have funding for

509
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,480
onion services for many months forward

510
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,010
and we plan to do certain improvements

511
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,310
on them along with the ones we've

512
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,379
already done one pretty good one is that

513
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,389
we plan to port onion balanced which is

514
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:09,070
currently only supports the old onion

515
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:13,040
services we plan to like revamp it and

516
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:15,230
do support for v3 onion services which

517
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,990
is something that lots of people are

518
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,809
asking us for and it's basically one of

519
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:23,360
the major ways to provide the big onion

520
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:25,629
service right now and another thing that

521
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,969
we've been thinking about a lot is that

522
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:30,830
we have problems with the usability of

523
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,779
funion services and the fact that the

524
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,090
onions are super long and the names are

525
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,860
super long and we are thinking about how

526
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,899
to improve this particularly with the

527
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,840
new onion services other black 56

528
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:44,959
characters long and we plan to like

529
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,418
experiment with HTTPS Everywhere to

530
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,120
blend onions into it to provide some

531
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:51,830
sort of like smart bookmark system which

532
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,529
you can share with other people as

533
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,960
really like I'm a temporary solution for

534
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:59,990
now and as we go forward we're looking

535
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,559
at like more advanced naming systems and

536
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:09,350
more secure and smart stuff to kind of

537
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:12,369
integrate them with tor and we've also

538
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:15,709
been working on like the anti censorship

539
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:18,049
level and trying to improve the

540
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,309
pluggable transports specification and

541
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:24,679
make it more integratable with other

542
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:26,720
like projects and make it more versatile

543
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,639
and we've been doing lots of

544
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,039
improvements around anti censorship in

545
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:37,219
general and this is what alex is gonna

546
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:39,049
talk to you about now thank you so my

547
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,820
name is Alex I'm usually part of the

548
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,289
same team that George is on namely the

549
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,039
network team which is responsible for

550
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:48,919
the core part of the Tor network daemon

551
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,779
in metal in the middle of 2018 we

552
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,519
realized that usually the network team

553
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:55,639
were responsible for the anti censorship

554
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,899
part of the organization but we didn't

555
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:59,570
really have time for it and we didn't

556
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,399
prioritize it high enough so what we did

557
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,439
was that we created a dedicated anti

558
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,719
censorship team we had a hiring round

559
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,909
where we hired two people and a small

560
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,070
amount of the network team joined in on

561
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:14,570
the anti censorship team to sort of get

562
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,740
it started the idea with the anti

563
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,299
censorship team is that they are going

564
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,220
to fight you thing you can see here

565
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,200
namely the censorship we see in various

566
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,419
regimes around the world different

567
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,129
countries some of these are from the

568
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,869
Middle East but there's also one of them

569
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:28,490
that can change one from Denmark it's

570
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:30,649
practically the same system it's just

571
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,610
used in different tuning parameters and

572
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:33,610
how much they're being used

573
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:42,889
so the big thing we have here is that we

574
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,260
generally know that UPS four seems to be

575
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,200
working it works for many uses around

576
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,030
the world but one of the problems for it

577
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,600
is to get access to reliable bridges

578
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:54,710
these bridges are the ones that people

579
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,290
need to put up in their tor

580
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:01,130
configuration or via the browser to get

581
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,780
it running we also know that the main

582
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,370
fronting which is the technique where

583
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,190
you sort of establish a TLS connection

584
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,439
into one of the big public clouds with

585
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:12,530
where you set an sni header to for

586
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,630
example a big site that that the center

587
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,730
is unlikely to block and then you make

588
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,100
an HTTP request inside of it with a

589
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,780
different host header where the load

590
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,699
balancer at the edge of the cloud will

591
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,320
route you to the right customer which

592
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,990
then happens to be someone from Detroit

593
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,820
who's running a bridge one of the

594
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,890
problems with the domain fronting

595
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,260
pluggable transport that we have that's

596
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,570
called meek is that it's incredibly

597
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,920
expensive to operate for people who are

598
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,840
familiar with tor they will know that

599
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,190
sort of the incurring traffic is the

600
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,020
same as the outgoing traffic when you

601
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,700
were running a relay which means we have

602
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,300
to pay for all this traffic that's going

603
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,980
in and out of the of the clouds this is

604
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,710
something we would we would really like

605
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:56,030
to to like deal with this means that

606
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,740
we're continuing the efforts to

607
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,660
generally make it easier for people to

608
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,240
get access to breeches one of the things

609
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,230
we did recently in the last year is that

610
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,080
we integrated as something called mote

611
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:11,210
mote is a system where you access bridge

612
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,629
to be over a domain fronted connection

613
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,040
directly in the UI of the tor browser so

614
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,810
people who are not familiar with bridge

615
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,970
to be bridge to be is this system that

616
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,980
people who are in central areas have to

617
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,800
access to get access to these bridge

618
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,180
lines that you put in the configuration

619
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,919
this has generally been a difficult

620
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,990
thing for some people to get access to

621
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,370
you have to solve a CAPTCHA first you

622
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,290
have to go to a website we also have

623
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,879
different entry points to it so you can

624
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,370
for example send an email to a gmail

625
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,010
account we will then reply with an

626
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:41,510
automated system with these bridge lines

627
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:44,180
but now it's integrated directly in the

628
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:46,279
browser's the win tour starts up for the

629
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,950
majority of people here in

630
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:51,049
when you use tor it's mostly about the

631
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,029
anonymity and the ante tracking features

632
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,168
you get from it but for some people in

633
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:56,419
other parts of the world it's about

634
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,099
reach ability so for them it's not the

635
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,570
same thing when they start toward they

636
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:01,309
normally don't connect to the network

637
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,369
because all the entry points to the

638
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:06,859
network is censored so having this UI

639
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:08,330
directly in the browser generally makes

640
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:11,478
it much easier for people to get access

641
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,189
to it they now have to solve the capture

642
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:15,289
inside of the browser instead of going

643
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,090
to a separate web site solve it there

644
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:19,549
get the lines copy them into the browser

645
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,869
and then being able to connect so this

646
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,759
is a very good step in the right

647
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:27,259
direction for the UX of getting access

648
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:29,059
to bridges so I mentioned before that we

649
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:30,830
have Meek which is the domain fronting

650
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,119
technique that generally seems to be

651
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,609
working very well but it's very

652
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:36,408
expensive to operate one of the big

653
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:38,330
things the new anti censorship team has

654
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:41,179
been working on together with bridge to

655
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:44,960
be improvement and so on is a pluggable

656
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:48,499
transport called snowflake the general

657
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,039
idea about snowflake is that you do we

658
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:53,659
have a client inside the central area

659
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,639
what it does is that it has a domain

660
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:58,159
fronted request to a broker which could

661
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:01,519
be seem a little bit like a more fancy

662
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:05,869
way of having a bridge to be what the

663
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,820
broker responds with is a token which is

664
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,559
the connection identifier from one of

665
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,559
these snowflake proxies that exists on

666
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:15,379
the uncensored part of the Internet

667
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:17,658
these proxies are running in people's

668
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:19,248
web browsers or pupils like you in here

669
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:21,169
you can go to this website download the

670
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:24,139
web extension in your Chrome or Firefox

671
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:25,789
browser and what you're doing is that

672
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:27,949
you're practically providing access for

673
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:29,509
people to enter the Tor network using

674
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,849
your web browser so your web browser

675
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:33,409
become sort of a mini-tour relay without

676
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:37,759
actually all the features of the normal

677
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:40,070
tor relay this is a good system for us

678
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,469
in that it has significantly less cost

679
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,178
because the data is growing yep a lot of

680
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:46,489
people we distribute sort of the load of

681
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,859
C traffic out to multiple people's web

682
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:51,200
browsers and the only domain fronted

683
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:52,849
data we need to exchange is the initial

684
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,789
request from the client to the broker

685
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:57,019
and then the brokers respond and then we

686
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,059
are done having any connections between

687
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,720
that so it's very limited it's just a

688
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:03,289
small as

689
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,970
drink that's being exchanged what your

690
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,530
web browser will be doing is that it

691
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,480
uses a WebSocket connection to a

692
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,120
specific bridge that is currently

693
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,860
running and from the bridge on you the

694
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,629
user will be able to connect to their

695
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,699
final destination which is the Tor

696
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,080
network in distance but it's designed

697
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,520
like a pluggable transports or there are

698
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,780
certain other organizations that are

699
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,850
providing systems that are compatible

700
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,350
with these pluggable Transport and they

701
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,000
will be using be able to use the

702
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,309
snowflake system as well with slight

703
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,690
modifications but you can go to the

704
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,370
website and check it out it's a very

705
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:35,750
cool project and it's still sort of in

706
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:37,189
development we're coming to the end of

707
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,980
this presentation but we have a few

708
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,559
things we would like to say people in

709
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,630
here probably very familiar with that

710
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,190
the Tor works like I've like a typical

711
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,960
sort of research organization and

712
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,059
there's a non-profit so what we do is

713
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,409
that we sit down twice a year discuss

714
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,928
what we would like to do over the

715
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,640
upcoming year and then we have a grant

716
00:33:53,929 --> 00:34:01,280
writing team that needs to make sure

717
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:03,230
that we get some money these grants make

718
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,908
sure that we can do the general features

719
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,860
the big features we would like to do but

720
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,320
there's a lot of things that first of

721
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,810
all we cannot find grants for to do like

722
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,389
things we would love to do and there are

723
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,859
also certain things that just shows up

724
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,109
for example one of these things that

725
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:22,098
George was talking about about DDoS we

726
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:24,529
had in December 2018 a very there was a

727
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:26,419
very high performance equation and the

728
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,730
network that was not something we have

729
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:30,618
planned for so that is where when we get

730
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,330
donations these money are being spent

731
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:34,129
for developers hours to fix these things

732
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,129
when they come up these things that we

733
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:40,759
like cannot receive we're going to have

734
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:43,399
this box mash fund here in August the

735
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,560
idea is that people donate money to us

736
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,969
and we have some of the box that we find

737
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,440
interesting that we would really like to

738
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:51,199
solve but that we haven't been able to

739
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,570
find funding for over a longer period of

740
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,969
time these money will go directly to

741
00:34:53,570 --> 00:35:00,440
developer hours to to sort these things

742
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:02,980
out so do donate so one of these things

743
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,450
is how can you help with the Tor project

744
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,820
we're generally trying to separate the

745
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,919
network from like the organization we

746
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,089
have a certain overlap of things but

747
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,510
generally everyone in this room should

748
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:14,549
be able to run

749
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,520
a chore relay or bridge if you want to

750
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:19,140
do that we recently had made a relay

751
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,500
kite to make it easier for people to get

752
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,700
started operating and running relays and

753
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,380
that is one thing you can do or you can

754
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,970
also help run a bridge we're going soon

755
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,940
to have a campaign about getting more

756
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:32,520
ups for bridges as part of the

757
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,530
anti-censorship team goals because right

758
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,880
now we have a lot of ups for proxies

759
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:39,990
that are not really working so we could

760
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,240
really use some more of those one thing

761
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,589
we have done recently is that as Gus

762
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,390
also mentioned with the website

763
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:47,069
translations and so on all our

764
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,348
applications these days are getting

765
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:51,240
translated using this central system we

766
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:53,220
have we could really use help with

767
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,069
getting people to translate our stuff

768
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,779
both website and our applications are in

769
00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:00,150
need of having active containers to

770
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,670
translate them and as mentioned you can

771
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,670
donate to us which is very much

772
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,650
appreciated and we will also send some

773
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,390
send some swag to you if you do that one

774
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,069
thing we're changing now is that we're

775
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,710
going to differentiate a little bit

776
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:15,839
between one-time donors and recurring

777
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,059
donors and the recurring donors are

778
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,500
going to receive more goods if they if

779
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,500
they continue to donate to the project

780
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,529
we have a small booth here at the CCC

781
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:30,630
camp at the about freedom village you

782
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,460
can go by probably a little bit after

783
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,190
the event but at some point during the

784
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,809
day you can donate and get t-shirts and

785
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:41,339
we also have some stickers if you are

786
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:44,220
very interested in that we have time for

787
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:46,410
some questions now and once we are done

788
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,419
if people are not comfortable with doing

789
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,740
questions here we'll go outside and

790
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,640
people can come and ask us questions

791
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,640
thank you

792
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:04,529
all right so if you have questions for

793
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:07,740
gecko goofs Alex or George please queue

794
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,630
up here at the microphones do we have a

795
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,180
question over there do we have some

796
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:17,580
questions I'm sure that we have some

797
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:20,310
questions come on guys maybe people want

798
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,830
to do them outside it is too hot in here

799
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,230
could that be the case it is towards so

800
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:28,080
do we have anything from from outside

801
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,220
the tent from the net no we don't there

802
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,770
we have the first question

803
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,359
please shoot ahead are there any

804
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:41,280
independent tower networks like

805
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:46,710
decentralized like in running using your

806
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,420
time not not all connected to one we

807
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,430
can't really hear you can you get closer

808
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,560
to the microphone and ask the question

809
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:55,529
again sorry about this are there any

810
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:02,370
independent our networks installed

811
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:05,370
running any what oh no

812
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,020
so we not not to my knowledge do you

813
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,540
guys know if we have any independent or

814
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,060
networks that are not operated by like

815
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,040
the normal official network we have a

816
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,890
test networks but that's operated by us

817
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:24,240
as well so that doesn't get the

818
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:26,460
independent label any more questions it

819
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,580
would be what you up in the microphone

820
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,580
please

821
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,240
here we go

822
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:39,899
how do you measure the traffic over the

823
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:43,439
network Isis also included fake traffic

824
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:47,280
you generate by yourself to make more

825
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:54,330
entropy or is it just traffic entering

826
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:57,270
the network and so user traffic so all

827
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:00,480
relays the nodes of the network actually

828
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,410
report statistics about the traffic that

829
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,650
goes through them every day

830
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:10,799
I think that also includes the padding

831
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,660
traffic by default I think there are

832
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,970
plans in the future to kind of

833
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,740
distinguish these two so that we can see

834
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,410
how much padding overhead we have over

835
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:23,299
the network but I think we don't have

836
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,299
that right now I think so I'm not sure

837
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:34,640
and an additional question Technic car

838
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:41,869
is the snowflake solution with WebRTC

839
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:46,310
it's a first step for censored clients

840
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:50,550
how this is different to the classical

841
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:53,400
solution so you still have to provide a

842
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:56,160
signaling server for the web RTC client

843
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,340
that you get to the web RTC connection

844
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,618
so what is different is this server you

845
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:06,930
have to provide the signaling server and

846
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:08,609
still this server can be blocked now so

847
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,200
the general game you play when you're

848
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:13,470
doing the anti-censorship

849
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,910
arms race is that these sensors usually

850
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:19,140
don't want too much sort of collateral

851
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,460
damage so bye-bye we are sort of

852
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,080
exploiting a little bit to sort of

853
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,180
centralization that's happening on the

854
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,970
internet right now where so many sides

855
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,270
are hosted by Amazon Google and

856
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:32,129
Microsoft and by using IP addresses in

857
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,710
their IP space and during the domain

858
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:39,930
fronting part we generally start playing

859
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:42,869
a game where the these sensor will need

860
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:46,379
to block the whole area of of the IP

861
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:48,330
space for these public clouds just just

862
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,160
like we do with with meek in practice

863
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:52,020
the people who are running these

864
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,720
snowflake proxies that is the small

865
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,970
lightweight installations in the web

866
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,680
browser should generally not be in areas

867
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,450
where their censorship because that is

868
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,910
the place where you can block the access

869
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,339
to the central bridge which is the

870
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,950
access point to the Tor network did that

871
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,810
explain thank you

872
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,819
so we do have a new questions over there

873
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:15,960
could you make use of the monitor here

874
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,350
that we might hear the question hi hi

875
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,480
guys

876
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:20,720
I remember last

877
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,520
year Google and and the Amazon announced

878
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,740
they were gonna be prohibiting domain

879
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,850
fronting but I saw in your talk that you

880
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,709
said that the main front thing is still

881
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,900
working pretty well could you spend a

882
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,940
minute or two sort of describing sort of

883
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,980
the current status of the main fronting

884
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,720
which providers are still allowing it

885
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,280
which ones are prohibiting it and like

886
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,270
how is it working if two of the biggest

887
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,800
companies have said they're not gonna

888
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,540
allow it anymore right

889
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,369
that is definitely a big problem I think

890
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,230
we are only having one entry point right

891
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:48,650
now with with meek am I right about that

892
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,990
which I think it's Microsoft Amazon and

893
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:53,000
Google does not do it so there are other

894
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,500
options we can use their domain fronting

895
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,810
is a general technique and the one we

896
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,530
explained here was the where we cheat

897
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:03,410
with the ETLs sni header for example

898
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:06,410
amazon also has their simple queuing

899
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,850
service which is a central endpoint that

900
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,819
all applications that integrates with

901
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,618
those will use using that you can do

902
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,010
sort of request response applications

903
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:20,119
using using Amazon which is I would say

904
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:21,500
a more legitimate way of of using their

905
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,730
service whereas the other thing we're

906
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,770
sort of exploiting the difference

907
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:28,010
between how web servers handle TLS

908
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:29,359
versus the HTTP so that is one thing

909
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:34,160
we're investigating right now the other

910
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:38,230
one is des and I which is if people are

911
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:42,500
familiar with cloud flares work on this

912
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:44,300
ES and I is one of those proposed

913
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,090
standard I'm not sure it's a standard

914
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,250
yet but it's an idea where you start

915
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:52,220
encrypting S&I but it generally works

916
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,530
best if you have many websites on a

917
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,118
single server or as a single provider

918
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,680
there are some things we can do there

919
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,570
that we're experimenting with right now

920
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,319
but they're still missing support for

921
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:05,950
these in the big TLS libraries what's

922
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:09,290
that a good enough awesome all right

923
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:12,368
so by the looks nobody is queuing

924
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:16,130
therefore we gonna close that over here

925
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:17,990
gecko coos Alex and George thank you

926
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:21,020
very much for the update on the onion

927
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,299
and that is your applause
