[Music]

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,420
this is about participatory events and

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,650
one such event in particular but I'm

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,290
going to try to make it a little bit

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,790
more general so that people can use the

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,730
same sort of principles for other things

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,549
and it's about participatory events and

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,640
one set of tools to help run them and

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,489
make their community stronger now what

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,739
is a participatory event it's an event

11
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,769
where the line between organizer and

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,199
attendee is blurred or non-existent and

13
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:45,929
that events where art and performance

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:48,748
play a part the line between artists and

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,640
audience is blurred and of course the

16
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:53,070
camp that we're at right now is a great

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,719
example of a participatory event but

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,219
that's not the event that we'll focus on

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,769
because you're already here and you

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,210
already know how this is but I will tell

21
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:02,280
you about an event called the board lamp

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,110
with which I have been heavily involved

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,470
in recent years so this is the board

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,430
land

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,650
it's a participatory event in which the

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,140
board land organization brings only

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,800
toilet water some heavy machinery and

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,250
electricity

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,840
and although we bring electricity the

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,350
participants often even have to help

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,260
roll out the 63 amp cables if they

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,839
arrive early everything else from stage

33
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,550
2 structures to streetlights and showers

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,100
are brought and built by the

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,250
participants themselves and there are

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,860
now over 3000 of them we do this event

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,770
every year and many of them stay for

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,830
eight or ten days on-site and some stay

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,929
for up to 18 days and much like camp

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,840
here everyone pays their own membership

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,300
and even the board of the organisation

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,330
pay to be there the same as everyone

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,060
else and it was started with a very

44
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,850
specific purpose in mind and our purpose

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,040
is to prototype our dreams and allow our

46
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,500
imaginations to run free and try to

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,259
bring dreams and realities closer

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,420
together an experimentation is at the

49
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,279
very core of the born land and we want

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,099
to apply that not only to the art and

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,970
the self-expression and the parties but

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,980
to the community

53
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,840
and the organization itself and again

54
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,940
blurring the line between participants

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,570
and organizer is in the DNA of the

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,850
Borland so let me just use a minute or

57
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,549
two to show you rather than tell you

58
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,700
what the borderland is the board land is

59
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,520
moving things back and forth its

60
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,250
building infrastructure it's leaving a

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,130
better trace in this case a temple that

62
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,650
we left on site this year it's communal

63
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,790
effort here 50 people helping to race

64
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,760
the central tower of the temple the

65
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:59,109
board land is art its kitchen

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,350
conversations it's dancing it's midnight

67
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,060
meditation there's a lot of different

68
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,489
sorts of spiritual practice meditation

69
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,950
yoga etc at the Berlant plays a big part

70
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,860
the board land is setting things on fire

71
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,100
in this case an old piano while somebody

72
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,430
was playing it it's a pretty good

73
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:22,840
concert the Borland is gifting it's a

74
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:25,060
completely gift oriented economy there's

75
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,730
nothing as bought or sold on site

76
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,200
nothing at all so people bring the

77
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,049
things that they want to give to others

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,179
be it food or drinks or presents and

79
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,330
they give them out creating abundance

80
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,020
for the participants the born lioness is

81
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,850
sea of LEDs much like camp here

82
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:49,300
it's an improvised black metal band it's

83
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,760
engineering and it's being and if you

84
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,239
see here the the balloons coming out of

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,429
that toilet stall it's because a lot of

86
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,440
the toilets are actually decorated a lot

87
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,630
of the time by this a group that makes

88
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,090
it into the raw project to create a

89
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:10,630
unique experience in each toilet stall

90
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:13,150
and it's friendship and it's an online

91
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,719
community and this is what I'm going to

92
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,209
be focusing on during this talk because

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,919
we've built a few custom-made tools for

94
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,580
the Borland and other tools we have

95
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,380
found dreams and realities and loomio

96
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,050
are the ones I'm going to focus on we

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,479
built dreams we built realities loomio

98
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,879
we use me made by a great group in

99
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,128
and that we also use pre ticks that I

100
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,860
know comes from here and the key cloak

101
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:43,939
but my focus tonight is going to be

102
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,370
these three tools and before I move on

103
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,319
to those specifically I want to throw us

104
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,039
a little bit into another participatory

105
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,659
event which is Burning Man and at

106
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,300
Burning Man there is this saying that

107
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:59,289
the playa provides and the playa being

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,479
what people call a black rock desert and

109
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,490
what do people mean when they say the

110
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,560
planet provides but they mean is that

111
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,960
there's this feeling of that you can

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,659
very quickly find exactly what you need

113
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,080
just by wandering around often before

114
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:17,629
you even knew that you needed that thing

115
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,240
and there are many reasons for why this

116
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:21,949
is a common experience but I think that

117
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,189
one of those reasons is that Black Rock

118
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,439
City compared to a modernist city which

119
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,749
is very straight roads and everything is

120
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,559
sufficiently planned it's a much denser

121
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:36,080
network meaning that walking from A to B

122
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:38,300
at Burning Man you're exposed to a much

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,969
larger variety of people in places than

124
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,740
you are in a modern structured city you

125
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:44,930
have many more interactions in a given

126
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,999
period of time meaning that everyone

127
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,189
accumulates much more knowledge about

128
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:52,039
what resources are available and where

129
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:55,219
they are and simply put the network is

130
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,620
denser so the number of jumps from you -

131
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:59,569
what you need is perhaps smaller at

132
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,889
Burning Man than it is usually the case

133
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:06,319
in much of ordinary life so I'm going to

134
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:09,229
talk about a few design principles that

135
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,149
I found useful than building tools for

136
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,279
hauling communities and thinking about

137
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:15,020
how to use them

138
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,810
based on my experience I'm gonna make a

139
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,508
case for that it's possible to nurture a

140
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:24,139
connected community online by trying to

141
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,149
build maintain and map a dense Network

142
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,159
and we're going to take us through three

143
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:30,589
steps which are to increase the

144
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,748
collision rate to make sure that good

145
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,689
connections have a chance to last and

146
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:37,759
grow and finally to map out the paths so

147
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:41,580
that people can find their way to what

148
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:46,080
they need and first

149
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,240
besides a little bit of a segue I want

150
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,370
to give us a stronger framework to build

151
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,949
on and also because I find this example

152
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,750
so incredibly interesting let me take

153
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:58,319
you on a short detour to Central Asia

154
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,199
and the Silk Road the Silk Road was in

155
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,400
fact not a single Road at all it wasn't

156
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,710
even a few roads

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,169
it was a dense and dynamic network of

158
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,080
thousands of routes through the Central

159
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,810
Asian highlands and a merchant could not

160
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
decide an exact route before they set

161
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,560
out it wasn't possible what you needed

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,539
to do was make your way on this

163
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,930
resilient web of different possible

164
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,909
connections step by step if one pack

165
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,370
passage was blocked or otherwise

166
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:28,830
unavailable there were other paths to

167
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,330
choose from and of course this story

168
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,068
might be familiar for people here

169
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,599
because it's in the context of how

170
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,659
packets are sent over the Internet as

171
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,000
well it's the same story so how did this

172
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,129
these networks arise you know I mean a

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,280
lot of the time people talk about them

174
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:46,949
as if they arose because of trade but

175
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,258
professor Michel frischetti who has

176
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,560
graciously lent me this slide on the

177
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,449
next slide has built this very likely

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,139
hypothesis that what drove the creation

179
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,940
of the networks was migration of sheep

180
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,349
ok sheep and nomads you might be

181
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,710
thinking bear with me I'm going

182
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:07,440
somewhere with this promise just trust

183
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,318
me now in the spring

184
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,900
nomads release herds of sheep for summer

185
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,880
grazing in the highland pastures over

186
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,979
the central asian highlands and these

187
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,930
sheep would look for the best quality of

188
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,909
grass and that would often be in

189
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,880
pastures high up in the mountains

190
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,199
so sometimes sheep from one side of the

191
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,389
mountain and another side of the

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,310
mountain come to the same pasture and

193
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,770
they meet and they sit there and you

194
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,110
know eat grass for the summer then the

195
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,120
nomads come to get their sheep they find

196
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,070
their sheep at the same posture and

197
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,099
nomads from one side of the mountain and

198
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,510
the other side of the mountain meet and

199
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:46,260
understand that each other exists and

200
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,620
the network a path is formed and Michael

201
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,720
Fischetti was actually able to with

202
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,540
simulations and then excavations prove

203
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,410
that this is very likely the case trade

204
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,009
did not come

205
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:02,040
first trade was made possible because of

206
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:05,069
the network and the network is formed by

207
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,230
some completely different mechanism so

208
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:10,410
what you learn from this is that it was

209
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:16,050
not it wasn't planned but it arose from

210
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:19,920
something else so how can we increase

211
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,899
the density of our networks with the

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,180
tools that we use online for for

213
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,879
planning our events and coordinating our

214
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,019
communities what could drive our

215
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:34,379
networks to form and at the borderland

216
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:40,379
one could argue that our sheep are

217
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:43,050
dreams or art and how can we harness the

218
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:46,860
way that art brings us together and

219
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:50,399
projects brings us together and events

220
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:54,389
bring us together to make our community

221
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,370
stronger and more connected so we built

222
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:58,620
a platform called dreams it's

223
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,810
essentially an internal Kickstarter

224
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,819
without actually handling any real money

225
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,920
in the system it's just little tokens

226
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:06,839
going back and forth and it allows

227
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,250
participants to gather projects they

228
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,149
want to bring to the borland

229
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,699
on this platform and every dream every

230
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:17,310
dreamer that puts a dream on the

231
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,930
platform gets a guide and the guide is

232
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,649
just another community member and other

233
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,939
peer helping them to get the dream to a

234
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,649
place where it's fulfilling the

235
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:29,130
guidelines and it's likely to be funded

236
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:32,430
and now we also use the dream platform

237
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,930
to distribute the budget the entire art

238
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,519
grant budget of the Burrell and its

239
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,309
crowdsource to the participants

240
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,800
themselves each of which get ten tokens

241
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:43,290
to distribute among the projects each

242
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,329
token being worth some amount of money

243
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,209
again there is no actual money this is

244
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,888
not any crypto there are no transactions

245
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:53,878
it's just little tokens it's voting

246
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:57,629
basically and finally all the projects

247
00:10:53,879 --> 00:11:00,180
and camps are self placed on a map so

248
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:03,000
that also increases these connections

249
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,529
between the different projects because

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,259
they have to interact with each other

251
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,760
when doing placement rather than having

252
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,580
placement being done for

253
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,000
by some other group and this might seem

254
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,250
chaotic but it drastically increases

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,970
these connections and makes people talk

256
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:23,010
to each other so this is how dreams

257
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,890
looks it's very familiar it's very

258
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:30,569
similar to crowd crowdfunding websites

259
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:34,830
this is how it looks when you're looking

260
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,750
at such a dream and in the admin view

261
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,530
you see er you can you know enable

262
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,240
granting or you can look at some safety

263
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:46,530
documentation so forth a little bit of

264
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,320
those features and what we did then this

265
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,260
before a dream gets approved for the

266
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,230
granting phase each dream is peer

267
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,450
reviewed by another dreamer to make sure

268
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,350
they meet the guidelines and that the

269
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,600
budget of the dream makes sense and

270
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,330
dreams are reviewed by posting comments

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,030
and by this mechanism of startling

272
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:12,180
little monsters so anyone can go in and

273
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,250
you can click the you know a necessary

274
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,890
material monster or the incomplete

275
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,720
budget monster and that goes Rhett it

276
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:22,020
gets read like that and gets startled

277
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,870
until the dreamer cset fixes the problem

278
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,350
and calms the monster down that's

279
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:31,230
another way in which you can promote

280
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,540
this sort of collision action of people

281
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,400
actually going and really reading about

282
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,430
what is going to happen at the event and

283
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,069
helping each other out and then during

284
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,979
the granting face participant distribute

285
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:49,500
a total of ten tokens to the dreams they

286
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:55,200
most want to see so how are we doing for

287
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,480
years in well in 2016 around 70% of the

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,350
total budget of the entire board land

289
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,390
event went to these participatory

290
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:07,140
projects straight to funding the

291
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,030
projects of participants but because

292
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,780
infrastructure costs and venue rental

293
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,980
don't scale linearly it's now around 50%

294
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,260
but it's still a very high number

295
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,280
thinking that you know this is not going

296
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,970
to anything else but what the

297
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,149
participants themselves want to bring

298
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:29,659
and this year we distributed around 120

299
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:33,079
thousand euros to about 190 projects and

300
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:35,449
each project was granted from 100 euros

301
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:40,539
for the smallest project up to 10,000

302
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:43,098
euros for the biggest project and

303
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:44,869
participation in granting among the

304
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:48,439
members of the board land is now at

305
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:53,149
around 50% having grown from we started

306
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:55,789
at around 20 50 % is around the same

307
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:58,189
participation rate as us midterm

308
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:02,419
elections horrible for midterm elections

309
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:04,429
pretty good for participating in

310
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:07,549
governance of what is essentially a big

311
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:09,559
party but think about what it means that

312
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:11,509
half of all participants spend time

313
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,089
going through projects that are going to

314
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:16,369
be at the ball and if ten people in your

315
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:19,339
camp have given grants and they have

316
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:21,369
even vaguely remembered ten different

317
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,779
projects they looked at to give grants

318
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:26,509
that means that in your file in your

319
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:29,149
camp you might have knowledge of up to a

320
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:31,099
hundred different things just among the

321
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,249
people in your camp before you even

322
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:35,989
arrived and what does this mean more

323
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,419
importantly you've interacted with

324
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,519
people online who have built these

325
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,919
projects meaning that the number of

326
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,869
relationship between camps and the

327
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,359
density of the entire network of the

328
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:49,789
organization and community is much much

329
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:51,199
higher and these relationships can now

330
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,299
be used for other things

331
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,699
much like the networks of the Silk Road

332
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:58,309
to lend equipment to coordinate

333
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,988
logistics plan events together and do

334
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:01,488
other things together because you have

335
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:05,449
these connections and you can start

336
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:08,119
using them so here's one example of how

337
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:11,118
we've applied this design principle to

338
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:13,459
increase connection density and the

339
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,559
first year we noticed that 40% of

340
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,988
participants were giving all of their

341
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,759
grants to a single dream instead of

342
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:21,799
spreading it out a lot of the time

343
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,749
probably they were giving it to their

344
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,119
own dream or to a dream that was on

345
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:28,909
their own count

346
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:30,529
so we tried setting a max of how many

347
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:32,460
tokens you can give to a single dream

348
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,740
starting at 7

349
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,720
what happened immediately is that it got

350
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,320
more spread out people didn't just now

351
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,210
give seven tokens and then leave the

352
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,910
three tokens to be wasted they usually

353
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:48,870
gave those three tokens away so you can

354
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:52,050
see the the red line of the graph being

355
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,320
Howard was in 2018 and the blue one we

356
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,089
tried to have five as the maximum pretty

357
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:02,870
much the same result so I think we'll

358
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:05,240
just stay there at maximum of five so

359
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,310
we've talked about how to increase

360
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,010
collision rate and how to sort of make

361
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:16,979
people have to interact more with each

362
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:18,779
other to form a denser network but this

363
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,420
creates a lot of pretty loose

364
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,970
connections how do you make these

365
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,040
connections between people last and turn

366
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,860
into paths of collaboration about things

367
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,040
like infrastructure safety security and

368
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,140
so forth how can you make the make use

369
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,760
of these connections what do people need

370
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,100
to be able to make use of these

371
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,560
connections to do other things on the

372
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,930
Silk Road important paths were

373
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,969
reinforced by building caravanserai

374
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,719
there were basically big stone

375
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:53,040
structures built on important paths in

376
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,720
the network at great effort hauling all

377
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,560
these rocks high up into the highlands

378
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,720
because you needed a place in which you

379
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,119
could plant continuation of your journey

380
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,189
a place where there was infrastructure

381
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,130
where you can stock up of supplies find

382
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,679
new companions to work with a place that

383
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,569
keeps the culture and the sort of memes

384
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:17,959
of the Silk Road that helped you survive

385
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:22,250
in it intact and reinforce those paths

386
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,660
so our sort of digital caravanserai is

387
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,329
looming ohm and we've named our low

388
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,660
instance of at board land talk looming

389
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,820
it was great built by some great people

390
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,010
in New Zealand I really recommend it

391
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,580
especially if you need to make a lot of

392
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:41,160
decisions together it's really good and

393
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,649
I want to take this opportunity to talk

394
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,300
a little bit about what I think really

395
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,880
helps what sort of features really help

396
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,830
when you're wanting to have a community

397
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,140
interact with each other together and

398
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,689
make connections last you need to be

399
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,190
able to form subgroup somehow and you

400
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,070
need to be able to collect and tag

401
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,170
reference and link it's bizarre to think

402
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,350
about that Facebook groups don't allow

403
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:08,530
hyperlinks or don't allow you to link to

404
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,000
a specific comment in a thread we used

405
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,639
to have this stuff it was called BB

406
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,770
bulletin forums and apparently most of

407
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,630
people online now have forgotten how to

408
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,760
do that you need to be able to move

409
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,130
conversations around of course too for

410
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,560
conversations you need to be able to

411
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:27,280
come back to a conversation maybe a year

412
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,020
later and find it and if you want to

413
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,090
make decisions together you need to be

414
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:35,350
able to gather advice and make decisions

415
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:38,139
and last but not least you need some way

416
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,110
and to be able to formalize the social

417
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,870
contract on the platform some way where

418
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,149
people can agree on you know what are

419
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,399
the rules of engagement in this group so

420
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,380
just a little bit about that and also

421
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,160
noting that Facebook has almost none of

422
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,870
these features which is why things a lot

423
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,670
of the time turn to when people try

424
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,060
to use Facebook for this sort of

425
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:05,860
coordination so this is how it looks

426
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:08,020
this particular group in on board land

427
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,540
talk is very important it's where we

428
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,270
make decisions transparently through a

429
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,340
method called the advice process and it

430
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,860
allows members of the community to step

431
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,000
into decision-making and change things

432
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,219
when they feel there's a need to do so

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,580
like I mentioned before the heart of the

434
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,410
borderland is experimentation and that

435
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,530
also goes for how we organize ourselves

436
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:35,800
and make decisions and we come up with a

437
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,139
process for governance that is mixing to

438
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,750
AA cracy that is the person who does the

439
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,260
work calls the shots mixing that with

440
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,110
conflict resolution practices and with

441
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,120
some really good tools from a book

442
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,199
called reinventing organizations by

443
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,050
Fredrik Alou we don't use the process he

444
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,670
describes in that book of face value but

445
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,210
we're definitely inspired by it so I'm

446
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:03,029
bringing it up

447
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,279
but these methods without the digital

448
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,690
tools like loomio and the other

449
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,600
platforms to use would not have

450
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,370
impossible to scale to an organization

451
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,100
of three thousand participants that sort

452
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,039
of come and go in a flux that's

453
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:21,689
completely reliant on having good online

454
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:23,940
tools so here's an example of how board

455
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,159
land infrastructure is planned openly

456
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,620
our main lead for building the power

457
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,190
grid is here outlining his plans and

458
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,989
asks camps to let them know where they

459
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,600
will be placed so that he can plan

460
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,389
accordingly and also if they need a lot

461
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,730
more power than he might be expecting to

462
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:43,649
let him know and to also comment on on

463
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,600
the plans as they happen it's all

464
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:50,250
happening transparently even to the

465
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,580
outside world by the way and this advice

466
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,080
process is one of my favorite examples

467
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,210
one of the members thought it was unfair

468
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,658
that his son would not be allowed to

469
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,700
enter for free when he turned 13 just

470
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,919
before the event started because he

471
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,700
bought his membership when the when he

472
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:13,730
was still 12 but then he turned 13 right

473
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:17,159
before and the rule was that if you're

474
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:20,460
12 years old or younger you can go for

475
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,620
free and he thought it would make more

476
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,360
sense to allow all children who were at

477
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,510
12 at the beginning of the calendar year

478
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,729
to be able to attend so he goes into the

479
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,190
borderland advice process group and he

480
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,230
starts that process I want to change

481
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,260
this and then he seeks advice

482
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:40,500
transparently in that group from people

483
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,139
on whether he thinks they think that he

484
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,539
can change this and then the decision is

485
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:47,490
his to make completely and he made the

486
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:50,269
decision to change it to a slightly

487
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:53,039
different proposal than what he at first

488
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:55,620
would eat first meant to do but

489
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,350
essentially he was able to do what he

490
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,158
wanted and solved a problem that he had

491
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,408
and if you think that this process seems

492
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,020
completely bizarre and you go like well

493
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:10,200
that doesn't work for XY said

494
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,300
maybe not but a lot of the time it does

495
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,640
work and I can't now because of just the

496
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,950
time constraints going to exactly how

497
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,620
and all the different protocols but I

498
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,870
recommend reinventing organizations that

499
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,080
book you can also have a look at talk

500
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:27,330
dr. Borland se slash advice where you've

501
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,340
sort of gathered those protocols and you

502
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,470
might be able to answer your questions

503
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:35,580
there or just contact me later if you

504
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,400
want okay so how engaged are our members

505
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,590
on talk or in governance in the blue

506
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,780
graph you see the number of users who

507
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:47,399
have interacted with some content at

508
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:51,720
least once and today it's around 1,800

509
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:55,790
users remember the mem the event has

510
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,440
3,000 participants and there are about

511
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:02,550
3,600 users registered on the platform

512
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,970
and the red graph you see that in the

513
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:09,030
red graph what you see is the 30-day

514
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,490
active users so users that have been

515
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:14,250
active within 30 days and you see at any

516
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,650
given point around 20 percent of our

517
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,660
members this year were active in

518
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,590
planning for the Borland up to three

519
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,320
months in advance

520
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,270
twenty percent were active at any given

521
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,800
point in governance and in total of

522
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,929
course more than twenty percent because

523
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:32,790
they don't they don't overlap all the

524
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:35,610
time and I want to show you something

525
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:38,879
interesting here in 2018 we lost our

526
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,729
location only seven weeks before the

527
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,580
event and when that happened five

528
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,710
different groups self-organized went out

529
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,220
and started negotiating in five

530
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,110
different locations without having to

531
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,760
ask the board for permission without

532
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,740
having to ask anyone refer mission they

533
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,129
were able to go out and try to solve the

534
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,620
problem that the community had

535
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:04,470
eventually a new location was found and

536
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,300
in a month before the event all the

537
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,380
plants had to be adapted to the new

538
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:12,178
location which meant that the capacity

539
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,190
had to grow very quickly of the

540
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,590
organization to handle everything and

541
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,330
because it's decentralized and because

542
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,699
people don't have to be elected into

543
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,889
positions of power and authority P

544
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,590
could come in and fill vacancies that

545
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,560
they saw were them and you can see that

546
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,720
over by that little arrow over there

547
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,480
when I recessed final locations

548
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,970
negotiated how activity on talk just

549
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,640
shot up as people were trying to solve

550
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:43,770
the problems of the organization so

551
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,680
what's essentially happening I think is

552
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:51,030
that people are reusing these networks

553
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:53,820
that are built by dream prototyping to

554
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:57,090
then use them for governance and

555
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,340
infrastructure co-creation and this is a

556
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,919
way in which the Borland differs from a

557
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,590
lot of other participatory events you

558
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,020
have a sort of three circles in which

559
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,060
you can do co-creation you have the

560
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,639
creative container the infrastructure

561
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,649
container and the process container so

562
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,180
this picture is made mom a good friend

563
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,360
Gustav who came up with this this

564
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,000
classification and an event like Burning

565
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,340
Man pretty much only allows co-creation

566
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,610
in the creative container you're

567
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,139
completely free to create and co-create

568
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,030
inside of that and you can make pretty

569
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,990
much any decision you want about the

570
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:36,360
creative content but you are not able to

571
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,560
co-create process or infrastructure and

572
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:43,260
that's the gap we're trying to bridge to

573
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,210
be able to live in the middle of all

574
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,680
these circles and allow co-creation of

575
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:53,130
all those containers at the same time so

576
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,130
after having reinforced connections of

577
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,890
course going back to the Silk Road

578
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:02,280
once these caravanserai route there once

579
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,530
these paths were out there you need to

580
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,990
map them because as a new person coming

581
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,820
in to this network you want to be able

582
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,740
to look at them a little bit beforehand

583
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,700
especially when they become very

584
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,980
sprawling and and and important also for

585
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,960
trade so of course people started

586
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,990
mapping the paths from China to Europe

587
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,190
and making maps how can we do the same

588
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:29,210
thing in this context so we're trying

589
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,630
this is a very complicated problem

590
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,250
but we built a tool called the realities

591
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,770
basically it's a mix between a wiki a

592
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:40,580
task manager and an organizational chart

593
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:44,810
and what you do is you can define a need

594
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:47,360
like power and that's defined that in

595
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:50,149
the green call there and then you can

596
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,360
define a responsibility that completely

597
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,900
or partially fulfills that need which is

598
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,909
in that purple column and each

599
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,770
responsibility has a realizer

600
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,410
which is the person responsible for

601
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,270
making that thing happen and the guide

602
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,420
which is somebody who knows how

603
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,300
something is done and what skills are

604
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,090
necessary to be the person responsible

605
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,600
for that so if a realizer suddenly drops

606
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:19,850
out the guide can find a new person and

607
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,929
the guide is also tasked with checking

608
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,000
in on the realizer

609
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,370
to see that they're actually doing what

610
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,490
they said they were gonna do and finally

611
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,439
define some dependencies between

612
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,650
responsibilities and we do this for

613
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,500
three reasons first of all when you need

614
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,360
to make a decision you need to know who

615
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,300
is dependent on you who are the

616
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,429
stakeholders in your thing so it's a

617
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,040
good way to keep track of who are the

618
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:49,430
people who I should ask for advice when

619
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,470
I'm making a decision and it's the job

620
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:54,350
of those other people to define that I

621
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,940
depend on you so they go in to realities

622
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,250
and they can define that dependency

623
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,160
we're still in the process of actually

624
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:05,300
making this work but it's new and it's

625
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:08,720
been this year used to a fair amount I

626
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,610
would say the second thing is that by

627
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,680
looking at a map before the dependencies

628
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,409
someone you and the organization can

629
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,930
understand how things fit together and

630
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,070
third we can identify critical

631
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,980
responsibilities that a lot of people

632
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,389
depend on in order to identify points of

633
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,340
failure and to see that the people

634
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:29,090
responsible for those have everything

635
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:31,820
they need in time so in house a little

636
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:35,740
graph it's very experimental and rough

637
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:39,159
still but here you can basically see

638
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:43,350
people of the outermost ring and

639
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,130
the ring within that our

640
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,500
responsibilities that have been claimed

641
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,150
by someone and the inner ring are

642
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,820
responsibilities that are not yet

643
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:57,880
claimed so you can see things like how

644
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,889
the guide edges are drawn around the

645
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,480
board so you see there that somebody up

646
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,610
there who doesn't have there were a lot

647
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,920
of their own responsibilities might be

648
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,330
guiding quite a lot but here you have

649
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,990
something that's even more interesting

650
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:14,139
which is the dependency edges and if you

651
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:16,510
look at that up in the left corner there

652
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,030
you can visually see that there is

653
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,650
something critical going on there

654
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,889
and you can sort of identify these

655
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,120
hotspots of where you might have points

656
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:29,170
of failure but you should pay attention

657
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,300
to and in this case what that

658
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,970
responsibility is is the event permit

659
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,100
application a lot depends on it and it

660
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,870
depends on a lot of other things so

661
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,580
should make sure that Peter who is in

662
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:45,489
charge of that has everything he needs

663
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:48,129
to to do his job and what is this for I

664
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,020
mean essentially if you have a

665
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,450
decentralized organization and you've

666
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:55,030
decided that you don't have the sort of

667
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,430
normal hair keys and people elected into

668
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,750
positions it makes it very hard for you

669
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,120
to be able to have this an

670
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,220
organizational chart and those are

671
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,739
useful for people coming into an

672
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,400
organization to understand who does what

673
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:11,670
so this is a little bit what you can do

674
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,240
to replace that but also of course

675
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:17,170
organizational charts are not true an

676
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,900
organizational chart looks more like

677
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,540
that in reality you have a lot of more

678
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,750
connections that are perhaps a lot more

679
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:30,310
important than what you actually see in

680
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:34,990
the clean chart yeah there are a lot of

681
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:38,020
really good ones in that one all right

682
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:42,820
so come through to mapping of the paths

683
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:44,650
and just want to reiterate the things

684
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,840
that we've gone through the ideas to

685
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,570
increase coalition rate and then

686
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,020
reinforce those connections and then map

687
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:56,149
out those paths

688
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:58,820
and in closing we've started this

689
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,980
project called participial to collect

690
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,740
other useful tools for participatory

691
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:08,210
organisations of course dreams and

692
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:12,110
realities loomio and others and we're

693
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,059
gonna basically use some of the funding

694
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,490
that we've had we've we got some funding

695
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:18,800
last year to push into some of the

696
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,500
development of these projects and we

697
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,649
also push them to a few other projects

698
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,840
also doing really interesting stuff for

699
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:30,410
participatory culture and and

700
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,659
organizations and there are now eight

701
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:35,300
different events at least that I know

702
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:39,050
about that use one or some combination

703
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:44,870
of these three tools and they range from

704
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:50,419
Germany to Israel Austria Sweden Norway

705
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:52,129
and you see the orange dots there they

706
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:55,730
don't actually use The Dream's platform

707
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:57,350
but they use methodology and just use a

708
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,780
spreadsheet because they're really small

709
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:05,899
events but they use essentially exactly

710
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:08,540
the same idea and just closing I want to

711
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,420
give a really honorable mention two or

712
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:15,760
three thousand which is a really really

713
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:18,080
great platform that does similar things

714
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,770
but in a very different way where you

715
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,350
essentially define resources events and

716
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,300
places and then you can mix those

717
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,309
together in order to create a

718
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,190
participatory festival for example in a

719
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:33,230
city so I'd really recommend going and

720
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:37,000
checking that out as well it's a very

721
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:39,559
different way to to do similar things

722
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,590
another really interesting tool is that

723
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:45,860
is do create it's essentially an

724
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,949
open-source task manager with a little

725
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,750
bit of bells and whistles that helps you

726
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:58,210
do it well for for participatory

727
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:58,210
organizations and that is it I'm

728
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:05,330
planning this participant on this URL so

729
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:09,710
you can go check it out there ask

730
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:12,260
find the git repo and I'm also at hooey

731
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,560
at edge writers thottie you so you can

732
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:19,090
ask me questions there and I think

733
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,090
that's it for me thank you very much

734
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:36,240
thank you well thank you thank you very

735
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:40,200
much do we have any questions from the

736
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,870
audience does anybody want to know over

737
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:50,370
there and you'll have to speak into my

738
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:52,409
microphone please I thanks for the great

739
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,080
talk one thing that was a bit unclear to

740
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,970
me as you said it's it's decentralized

741
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,350
and there's nobody being voted in

742
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,930
position and I was wondering how you

743
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,550
then decide on competence like if

744
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,260
somebody shows up and says hey I want to

745
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,730
do the power grid but he has no

746
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,170
experience with it for example how do

747
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:12,630
you organize or deal with this so this

748
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,360
is rare two things come in one that we

749
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,860
have this guide position meaning that

750
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,260
they're supposed to be someone in place

751
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,420
who knows what skills are required who

752
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,480
can talk to that person and say listen

753
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:27,330
I'm not sure if you can do this the

754
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,330
second part is that there to make any

755
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:32,069
decision you must seek advice so when

756
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,918
this person comes in and start making

757
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,500
decisions they're going to go around and

758
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,699
seeking advice from stakeholders

759
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,500
hopefully those stakeholders were pretty

760
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,909
quickly figure out that this person does

761
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,040
not understand what they're doing and

762
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:46,020
they'll talk to them and maybe find

763
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,449
someone else that can do it instead this

764
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,280
has happened and that's sort of how it

765
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:55,080
goes is a little bit of a soft way to do

766
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:01,710
it yeah thank you is there another

767
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:03,150
question okay so this is the exactly

768
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:07,110
question I was thinking when he looked

769
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:11,370
at like what's what's the discovery

770
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:13,110
mechanism for stakeholders in that graph

771
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,870
of people lies are based on the

772
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,140
dependencies or is it where does it come

773
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,330
from

774
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:23,730
how do you know who to ask for advice

775
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,590
where do you find them so this is yeah

776
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,720
the part of it that's a little bit of

777
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,550
magic and this is also why when you say

778
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,209
that anyone can make a decision about

779
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,400
anything it's not necessarily that

780
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,320
simple because you have to be in a place

781
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,780
in the organization where you actually

782
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,360
do understand these things but that is

783
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,790
also a little bit

784
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,170
a safeguard because it means that it's

785
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,230
very hard to start making decisions

786
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,880
without first getting to know people and

787
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:52,430
getting to understand the organization

788
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,080
but realities is also supposed to help

789
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,540
you with that by defining those

790
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,970
dependencies so that you can see at

791
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:01,070
least some lists of stakeholders and

792
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,569
maybe ask those stakeholders if there

793
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,860
are other people that they think you

794
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:09,590
should talk to there is a space frame

795
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,720
formality yeah

796
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,060
can you give an example of like conflict

797
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,609
resolution on this platform or whether

798
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,500
you had any kind of drama show

799
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:22,580
happening and how did this all that

800
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:24,950
right yeah so conflict resolution is

801
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,990
completely vital for this thing to work

802
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,200
if you don't have that the whole thing

803
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:32,089
collapses because if one person makes a

804
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,009
decision and another person makes a

805
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,350
decision about the same thing and they

806
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,020
can't agree then you have a conflict and

807
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:41,660
you need a way to solve that we have a

808
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:44,440
conflict resolution escalation that

809
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:48,830
starts with those two people just talk

810
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,810
while examining their own drives and try

811
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,830
to look at themselves and why they are

812
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,070
in this conflict

813
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:57,890
the second escalation goes to having a

814
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:00,500
impartial mediator someone who knows

815
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:03,350
conflict resolution get these two people

816
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,540
in a video chat and try to get them to

817
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:08,089
resolve the conflict using those tools

818
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,850
they can escalate up to a further level

819
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:14,090
which is a tribunal where they both pick

820
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:16,339
a person that represents them and then

821
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,620
they both agree on a third person and

822
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,680
that low tribunal makes the decision

823
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:23,900
the fourth escalation step it just goes

824
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,620
to the board of the organization we've

825
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:31,640
never gone further than the second so we

826
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,440
never done a tribunal it but it's also a

827
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,770
community of hippies they're pretty good

828
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:42,500
at at chilling out when necessary okay

829
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:46,130
and do we have a signal angel is there a

830
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,710
question from the internet woohoo

831
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,990
does it look like anything anybody else

832
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:57,270
want to know anything here we go

833
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:59,669
I understood that you have a board so

834
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:03,660
what happens if the board disappears

835
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:07,740
will the event still happening or it

836
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:11,129
will just disappear well I'm not sure

837
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:15,180
how it could disappear but I guess what

838
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:16,910
you mean if they just leave so the board

839
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:21,359
land is organized by a non-profit

840
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:23,279
association based in Sweden what happens

841
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,319
if the board leaves is that the members

842
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,839
of the organisation who are the people

843
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,420
who had memberships to the last event

844
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,720
call a new Annual General Meeting and

845
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:38,070
elect a new board so the members are in

846
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,660
the end the highest position of

847
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,490
authority and there's an annual general

848
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:46,129
meeting every year where the board is

849
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:49,830
elected by the members okay thank you

850
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:53,490
anybody else want to know anything I

851
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:58,650
sort of have to squint below the brim of

852
00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:02,089
my hat no three two one oh there's one

853
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,089
there Oh over there hang on

854
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:10,819
with people being able to choose the

855
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:15,230
jobs that they do sort of you know ad

856
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:17,390
hoc do you notice that people select the

857
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,789
same jobs year over year or that there's

858
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:23,240
a lot of turnover between who takes on

859
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:25,640
more responsibilities yeah it's very

860
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,680
different for different people I mean

861
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,230
I've gone through a lot of different

862
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,328
roles of responsibilities myself I like

863
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:36,200
to change a lot other people just

864
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:38,450
staying the same thing I mean I actually

865
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,118
think personally that we should aim for

866
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:43,279
people not being in the exactly same job

867
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,920
for more than about three years we're

868
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:48,859
not shooting rockets to Mars here like

869
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,480
you don't need that long to be able to

870
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:52,788
learn how to do these things and I think

871
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,980
it's better for the organization to get

872
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,930
new blood into doing things so we don't

873
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,319
get stagnant that but that's just my two

874
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,319
cents

875
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:12,828
okay three two one

876
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:16,368
well come out here hi I'm into Borland

877
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:20,569
this year very good nice I'm asking and

878
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:23,119
you had it a few a few years before how

879
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:25,038
did you develop how do you how do you

880
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,000
end up with this like how did the

881
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:34,400
decision process and talk about yeah

882
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,059
thanks so the decision to go towards

883
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,440
this decentralized advice process thing

884
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:47,150
was made in 2015 by the Annual General

885
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:49,490
Meeting that year and then there wasn't

886
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,329
really any plan for how to do this

887
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,669
online

888
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:54,470
there wasn't any plan for dreams there

889
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,230
was nothing of that it was essentially

890
00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:00,288
just a feeling of that it wasn't

891
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:02,119
sustainable or interesting for the board

892
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:04,519
to keep making and calling all the shots

893
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:08,210
about everything and it sort of just

894
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:11,288
grew out from there there was a period

895
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:15,289
in the beginning where we had people

896
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:17,430
being very evangelical about this

897
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:19,140
reinventing organizations book

898
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:23,700
and then it became almost like a war

899
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:25,920
about the you know validity of the exact

900
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,410
protocol that they defined in that book

901
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,540
and that wasn't useful at all so we

902
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,879
stopped using the terminology that the

903
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,500
Lu uses in that book which is teal we

904
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,059
just banned the word we said we're not

905
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,750
doing teal we're doing our own thing

906
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:42,150
we're just inspired by that and then a

907
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,500
lot has really happened with running

908
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:48,930
into points of failure you see something

909
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,460
that doesn't work when you have no

910
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,290
systems in place which is essentially

911
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,690
how we started we just said everyone can

912
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:57,720
make a decision about anything go and

913
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,609
then things started going wrong and you

914
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,919
start understanding how do we fix this

915
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:04,470
how do we fix that because in the end

916
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,680
the really vital thing in order to make

917
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:10,348
this work is to accept that there might

918
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,980
not be a board land and that would be

919
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:13,920
fine

920
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,140
I mean if there's no board land than the

921
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,119
organization has not wanted a board land

922
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,040
enough for it to happen otherwise it

923
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,190
would have sort of worked that to fix it

924
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,359
and if there isn't a board land one year

925
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,710
well if the organization is strong

926
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,598
enough you'll survive that there will be

927
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,730
a board land next year in the end it's a

928
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,500
big party in the field a lot of people

929
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,109
would be sad but it's not the end of the

930
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,490
world the stakes are low so that has

931
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:38,130
been a good way to do it and they think

932
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,589
it might have been a lot harder if the

933
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,849
stakes were much higher and if the

934
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:43,859
stakes are much higher in an

935
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:47,190
organization you probably to pay a lot

936
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:51,990
more attention to things not free but we

937
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:53,760
have a luxury so we can experiment yeah

938
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:57,990
you probably also have problems when it

939
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,930
scales into large we have realized that

940
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,390
we'll go up to 17 K participants you

941
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:08,129
know those structures begin to become

942
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:11,069
very young and the ball sort of you know

943
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:13,290
yeah as long as it's small it's very

944
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:18,420
neat and doesn't scale it was that well

945
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:19,369
okay three two one we have one more

946
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,260
question

947
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:26,240
No

948
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:28,310
do I miss out anybody okay well thank

949
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,490
you very much for coming and telling us

950
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:36,220
all about and let's have one final big

951
