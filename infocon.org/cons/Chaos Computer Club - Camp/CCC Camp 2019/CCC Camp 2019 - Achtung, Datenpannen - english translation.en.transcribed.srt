[Music]

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:20,689
this year had a data protection failed

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,869
personally raised your hands any data

4
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:26,660
protection fails in the audience I can

5
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:29,390
see as interpreter I can see 10 hands

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,390
maybe two honest who knows someone who

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,989
has had a personal data fail yeah many

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,379
more hands raised and for whom of you

9
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:42,260
did were the were close relatives

10
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:45,110
affected I know your pain I'm completely

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,000
happy that I can introduce overflow

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:53,090
tentative and linked to you with the

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,730
gdpr fails show about GDP are but also

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,010
in Freedom of Information and hopefully

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:04,699
a very entertaining 19 minutes show an

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:09,530
applause for these two please crying we

17
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:11,929
can't see much from here yeah a very

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,380
nice evening to you will simply start

19
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,179
with something to loosen up and we'll

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:27,740
see if our technology works at the same

21
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:30,049
time GDP our privacy by design privacy

organizational measures

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:49,840
I hate paper red tape data oh dear

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:56,880
data I hate data so much and ordering I

27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:02:01,020
hate that even more filing in order

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,000
it's about personal data name email

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,829
account number perhaps where they live

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,599
but also age size and weight and the tax

31
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:16,829
number are under protection obligations

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:23,720
data air data we have to protect the

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:26,940
data data is not a little thing

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,230
it should first take the effort then

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,329
reap the rewards reap the rewards these

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,149
in gun protecting data from all these

37
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,470
hackers and spies and all that nonsense

38
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,660
this happens if you use the same

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,769
password for several services and leave

40
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,810
your laptop open lying around or lose

41
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:51,450
that paper with all the passwords on it

42
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:55,560
data earlier data indeed we must protect

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:58,828
the data that all the data we have to

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,430
maintain them and order them fire them

45
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:07,709
fire them fire them data

46
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:11,730
yeah data I love data so much we have to

47
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,859
maintain them and and that's easy

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,358
look after them then they are much more

49
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:21,060
useful all right now to the Foundation's

50
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,700
the fundamentals of the GDP are and the

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,489
German Data Protection Act you have to

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,100
know what you have and why and prove

53
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,160
that they are safe

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,829
that's where why the EU had seven

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,030
principles that they came up with

56
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,870
according to which you record and

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:43,459
transmit and establish your protection

58
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,739
measures and these are fairness purpose

59
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:52,140
minimization correctness limitation of

60
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:54,660
storage integrity and accountability

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,429
and that's what you need for your

62
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,890
privacy statement data or year data you

63
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,490
have to protect the data

64
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:09,450
yeah the data we have to maintain it and

65
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,930
file it have to file it file it file it

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,929
data

67
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:20,760
oh yeah data I love data so much we have

68
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:25,350
to maintain it and look after it they're

69
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:30,210
much more useful in case we don't

70
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:33,050
understand something you have a hard

71
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,109
time interpreting the law data Tech

72
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:43,710
Protection commissioners will help us

73
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:47,610
it's free of costs data or year data we

74
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,390
have to protect the data so what does

75
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,040
that mean

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:55,950
were you in life I promise that I'll

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,700
take as much care as I can solving then

78
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:05,340
I can finally go back to my work data oh

79
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:09,930
yeah data I love data so much we have to

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:16,229
maintain it and look after it they're

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:18,110
much more useful and finally sight isn't

82
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:21,510
another - exactly

83
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:25,290
remember your processing manual and your

84
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,210
privacy statement and then we can start

85
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:38,810
[Music]

86
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:44,070
[Applause]

87
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:47,060
okay okay right and then we start so

88
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:54,510
we'll start how do we start over

89
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:59,449
well GDP our or fails we'll just get

90
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,449
some victims from the audience

91
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:08,490
which will help us get the most

92
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,560
difficult rules in the GDP are and I get

93
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,270
to grips with them somehow right okay

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,340
good idea

95
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:19,770
we have four chairs louder fire okay I

96
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,669
see lots of volunteers I'm looking for

97
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,669
four of them right

98
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,889
wow I still don't see a lot

99
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,690
one person showing up someone shouted

100
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34,430
out in the back there that's the second

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:39,810
one get on to the stage we need two more

102
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:46,260
okay the third one there so right the

103
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:52,800
last one last candidate okay that looks

104
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:55,280
good okay you choose a color

okay I don't have to remember this well

112
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,539
but these are all personal data and

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,169
these people have all invented

114
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:40,260
pseudonyms obviously and each of you

115
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:42,330
will get a sheet yeah you can talk kinda

116

119
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,870
a shaft up woman Vendela mind session ID

120
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,689
yes for us

121
00:07:50,870 --> 00:08:01,110
and detent title feared yeah it says of

122
00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:03,300
us yeah okay Oscar that we've come up

123
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:07,889
with some very interesting questions for

124
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:11,400
all of you and you all have the same

125
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:14,009
chance to win you we've taken through

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,599
two rounds and the best two will then

127
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,219
get into the final and that was it

128
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,360
basically the rest will explain itself

129
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:20,819
so shall we start

130
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,059
we still need four other candidates for

131
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,559
more volunteers please but you stay on

132
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:31,259
stage but you should be able to do some

133
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:33,360
limited amount of maths because we need

134
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,089
people that can calculate from the first

135
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,729
row because these people need to tally

136
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,099
up the points because I didn't manage to

137
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,500
get this kind of elaborate tasks

138
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,810
programmed which is tallying up the

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,519
points we'll just get some people on the

140
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,410
first where they can all calculate mmm

141
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,490
I'm quite sure of that they look that

142
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:57,300
way so who would like to count points

143
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,740
for Andreas yeah yes like that Saddam

144
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,740
you two belong together

145
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:06,870
you're not biased you know related 200s

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,779
or anything okay so you'll count his

147
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,829
points that's not an easy feat but

148
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,060
though because there have been many

149
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,550
points but you ain't managed and

150
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,609
sometimes candidates will fall back to

151
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:21,870
zero but they can catch up again to be a

152
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:25,470
Jonas another pseudonym who will count

153
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:30,779
Jonas's points you can call me musi as

154
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,819
well do we have someone ok please speak

155
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,870
into the microphone second volunteer for

156
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:36,810
counting

157
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:43,370
Jonas's points you just have to count

158
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,369
come on great so you count muesli

159
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:51,269
whatever well please do not travel the

160
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:56,389
points triple the points but who will

161
00:09:51,269 --> 00:10:01,649
count for Katrina or fairly cleanly and

162
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:03,689
observantly and doubly no someone over

163
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,260
there perhaps they all look they're all

164
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:09,719
looking away now

165
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,060
let's site BRV and we'll just point to

166
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,760
someone well that would be mean though

167
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,829
well if the advantage these people have

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,450
to stay until the end so we'll have four

169
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:23,550
people in the audience at least okay you

170
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,870
two belong together

171
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,770
I'm going to tell you what you have to

172
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,960
count up and you remember that in points

173
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:36,180
and who will do this for do this for

174
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:42,950
Wally looking and that way we'll get the

175
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:47,069
90 minutes field as well keine no one

176
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,290
over there you two belong together

177
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:53,100
you'll count for Olie

178
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,810
don't cheat just and you'll all start

179
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,380
with zero you can all remember that and

180
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:01,739
then we will start with round one we'll

181
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,570
start with the very easy tasks there's

182
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,080
always going to be four options for

183
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,410
choices and you have papers sheets that

184
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,000
you will hold up with the letters A to D

185
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,040
but the others should not see which

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,910
letter you will choose just the

187
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,910
secretive okay we'll start easy

188
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:28,170
who what does data protection protect

189
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:33,230
what do you think a data is a data

190
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:39,800
that's protected or be security of data

191
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:44,730
gigan one see what is particularly see a

192
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:48,449
data these security of data see the

193
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,970
offenders or D self determination about

194
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,480
personal information could you repeat a

195
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,680
question

196
00:11:51,480 --> 00:12:00,840
please forgive them how what we forgot

197
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:04,589
to say each of these four has a an

198
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:08,670
audience Joker well no it didn't figure

199
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:12,360
that that's only in round two so thank

200
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,839
mr. cookie if you ask about fishing

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,390
against is it protecting

202
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,420
of what so what does data protection

203
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,850
protect data security of data offenders

204
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:30,410
or self-determination of post about this

205
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:33,860
information dude deep beautiful these

206
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,350
sheets are maximally transparent and the

207
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:41,870
correct answer of course is D which

208
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:47,779
means 23 points for Andreas muesli will

209
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:53,770
go without Catherine 23 and only 23 you

210
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:57,439
all remember that so three times 23 okay

211
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:02,050
second question since when do we have

212
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:08,690
data protection laws maybe since May

213
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:18,290
2018 maybe since 1995 relied maybe since

214
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:27,680
May 1949 maybe since 1970 so a may 2018

215
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:30,380
be 1995 C may 1949 and D 1970 since when

216
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,329
do we have data protection laws decide

217
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:38,060
now ah this is sliced Nessie spread

218
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,560
great I don't have to count it down at

219
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,650
all it's very simple

220
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,750
we'll start simple so further back may

221
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:47,150
213 yes there was a data protection or

222
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,180
the GD P R but of course that was not

223
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,699
the first one by far in 1985 there was

224
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,949
the Data Protection Directive at the EU

225
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,290
level quite opened not old enough May

226
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,990
1949 was the basic law the German

227
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,329
constitutions in 1970 that was in fact

228
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,310
fact when the first date election law

229
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:09,440
was passed in the German federal state

230
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:16,459
of Hesse er so zero for muesli didn't he

231
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:19,130
have Dino yet see Katrin 23 to you I

232
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:21,619
don't know if it's 23 plus 23 Coe if you

233
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,550
can calculate that but try and over

234
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,490
there no points

235
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:30,910
next round over come on next round yeah

236
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:34,360
who is the father of the gdpr

237
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,819
that's going to be very difficult their

238
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,900
staff who is the father of the GDP our

239
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,220
first is that yun philip i believe

240
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,560
someone problem over fee

241
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,810
oh we have a problem now is it yun

242
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,510
Philip blushed slightly different

243
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:55,030
spelling there I see is it

244
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:58,770
Yun Philip or D is it host Z over the

245
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:02,079
current interior minister in Germany

246
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,660
okay they're all looking at the spelling

247
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,360
varieties of young Philip Ivan its name

248
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:12,180
you're completely correct to take a look

249
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,610
there you can all decipher this can you

250
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,520
you see the difference don't you between

251
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,160
a and B there's a another P coming

252
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,770
between B and C there's a - added or D

253
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,589
of course if if you choose D it's very

254
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:31,060
it's going to be very simple for you

255
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:37,920
right now try your luck see Connie come

256
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:42,069
on wonderful you've finished andreas

257
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,880
zero points for andreas a wrong zero

258
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,330
points Catherine wrong zero points and

259
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,760
only got it right B is correctly Yun

260
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,340
Phillip MIT does not have a hyphen in it

261
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,569
his name but two peas at the end of the

262
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:02,380
Phillip only how long have you been

263
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:08,620
training secretly not long at all next

264
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:11,770
question great why does the number 23

265
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:14,130
come from where does the number 23 come

266
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:17,819
from good question who can explain

267
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:21,160
Vietnam at 23 question to the audience

268
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,050
who got that idea and where from before

269
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,089
we own C oblem you know before we just

270
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,589
embarrass ourselves completely and and

271
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:34,709
try to tell the story ourselves who

272
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:38,459
wants to tell the story he would like to

273
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:41,758
I didn't want to tell so what why should

274
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:48,109
they tell the tale I have no idea at all

275
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:53,540
come on please tell we'll just we just

276
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:55,920
insert John Google Tron and 23 and

277
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,618
before we say something that's wrong

278
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,368
okay next question which important

279
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:04,610
principle has ever learned when I

280
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:08,549
started when he started working at the

281
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:12,658
data protection office from the lawyers

282
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:18,929
a the principal lawyers legal people are

283
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:21,510
always right be it depends CC well

284
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:26,610
surely it's in the law just look it up

285
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,319
or D we are God okay the question which

286
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,959
important principle has ever learned

287
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,770
from the legal people a the legal people

288
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,100
are always right

289
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:39,179
B it depends see what it's there in the

290
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:44,639
law or D we are God and from now on I

291
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:48,870
will follow a strategy ah tactic so we

292
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,360
have one B andreas 23 points to you

293
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:56,840
maybe you should fold it up so that it

294
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:02,610
cannot be seen through the sheets

295
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,918
doesn't muesli zero points Kathleen 23

296
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,289
points right it's correctly and Ollie

297
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:11,549
again correct again what is the correct

298
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:13,260
solution can you see I won this thought

299
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:19,740
okay I have a next round

300
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:22,200
ah it's the truth yes which of the

301
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,370
following ciphers huge should you select

302
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,940
should you choose and also come to us

303
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,939
and yes they are

304
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:33,630
where's that coming from on that screen

305
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:37,289
they're seeing the last question the

306
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:40,710
previous question which of the following

307
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:43,350
ciphers suits should you select TLS it

308
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,840
is each ADCs a with

309
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:54,509
RLC for 128 as a

310
00:18:47,840 --> 00:19:06,090
it let us a or be TLS DHE RSA export

311
00:18:54,509 --> 00:19:13,950
with TS forty cbc sha TLS DHE RSA with

312
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:22,980
aes 128 cbc che 256 or TTLs acdhh

313
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:25,859
RSA with aes 256 cbc 384 so flight

314
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,690
sorted here normal course cooking on

315
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:34,529
money you know that copter you see

316
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,330
Fukuda by so all the monitor has nice

317
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:47,309
time on without monitor its bill easier

318
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:52,289
okay yet you have you made your choice

319
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:55,158
let's see your letters cool holy I can

320
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:58,039
see show it to me please

321
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:03,989
you've got seen that's correct

322
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:08,580
30 23 points for Kerry in they start no

323
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:18,809
points for loosely and andreas please

324
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:24,629
resolve why ok you just kissed why the

325
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:25,649
rest is just bollocks the rest doesn't

326
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:31,498
just make sense

327
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:38,518
exactly I could just remember the lasts

328
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:43,220
digits and that would be nice these are

329
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:47,869
all existing surfaces not in my world

330
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,869
however claims that they're all real

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,299
well C and D don't look that bad dear

336
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,070
countrymen saga is not funnyman d you

337
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:16,379
could use in an emergency if you don't

338
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:21,620
if you can't use perfect so forward

339
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:26,340
secrecy and if you lock the data and

340
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,750
years later you get to the key that's

341
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,020
kind of I'd seen it it's going to be

342
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,020
broken

343
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,320
C encryption is a tiny bit weaker but it

344
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,450
has perfect forward secrecy so that's

345
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:46,289
better

346
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:49,260

[Music]

356
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:39,749
this is off there is stuff you become to

357
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:43,299
us see an office wants to use a software

358
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:51,509
which has data leaks to somewhere

359
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:53,440
some call it telemetry somebody says

360
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:57,340
that's not allowed

361
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:02,879
and who's responsible it is after a

362
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:08,830
garnish the responsible oversight agency

363
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:11,559
says that is not allowed now where does

364
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,210
the agency turn to whom does the agency

365
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:17,668
turn to who's responsible

366
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:20,230
I was cleared

367
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:25,690
Plato's minor static in your art Sofia

368
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:34,509
knows I'm stopping my strategy to select

369
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:38,799
only a answer B is correct site whoever

370
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:42,960
decides what to use is responsible the

371
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,960
organization for example it company

372
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:52,059
chooses or when yeah as admin the ions

373
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,668
at soonest most mysterious all the

374

starfish dishes often if you as a data

375
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:00,210
controller use software you are

376
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,210
responsible

377
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:14,460
let's see you what is the points 92

378
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:19,379
points for andreas worth and applause

379
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:24,780
[Applause]

380
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:27,629
not much less 23 points from his leave

381
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:33,158
[Applause]

382
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:35,850
who is counted for Katrine 125 points

383
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,850
for Kathleen

384
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:47,710
holy how much savage yes of course

385
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,710
oh you get the fifty euro later

386
00:24:50,740 --> 00:25:02,270
insecurities in communication how many

387
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:05,210
points well the audience members said

388
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:10,668
125 but that's not a multiple of 23 so

389
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:14,330
it was corrected 215 and the 50 euro fee

390
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:15,850
will be handed over later okay so now

391
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,620
there's going to be a jeopardy style

392
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,590
panel to choose lectures question from

393
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,449
data fails fake news hacker information

394
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,668
free to free vibration and question mark

395
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,600
other categories and there are different

396
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:33,100
values of course to choose from and if

397
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:37,399
you lose your category then you'll be

398
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:41,049
you're having a hard time so if there

399
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:46,220
are certain risk feels hidden here and

400
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:49,668
where you have to gamble a certain

401
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,970
amount of points and there are a few

402
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:55,570
jokers in there and a few surprises that

403
00:25:52,970 --> 00:26:01,910
we will just not mention at this point

404
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:04,220
cutting there is risk hidden that means

405
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:07,340
that the number that's shown here does

406
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:11,840
not apply you select which how many of

407
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,928
your points you want to gamble now those

408
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,799
that get it wrong will be taken down but

409
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:20,620
due to the great counting method of your

410
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:25,190
calculator you're in front so you choose

411
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:27,379
so is the audience Joker now active yes

412
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:33,169
one time you can ask the audience if you

413
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:36,530
don't know and those those whose turn it

414
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:41,450
is can also pass on the turn to whoever

415
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:43,760
shows up first okay I see so you can

416
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,940
always pass without losing points but if

417
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,200
you show up and get the wrong answer

418
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,970
when the question is passed

419
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,489
then you will lose points and what do we

420
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,200
do have no one's showing up okay we'll

421
00:26:52,489 --> 00:27:00,559
see cutting you go

422
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:04,220
data fails 64 okay let's see if your

423
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,239
conversation works yes this is a

424
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:12,470
question that you will read out okay

425
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:14,919
niobium on an hashing person really

426
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:18,590
personal relation let's imagine an

427
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:22,009
enterprise is building some telephony

428
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:26,389
app and and because email addresses and

429
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:29,980
phone numbers and says these are not

430
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:35,689
personal data because we've hashed them

431
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:39,399
with sha-256 it's come too far now the

432
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:44,090
question then is that are these data

433
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:49,869
anonymous or personal and why you get

434
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:52,519
arrows hashed data for whom for the

435
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:56,689
authority that is sending the data or

436
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:59,779
the organization that receives them for

437
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:04,580
the processor of those data so the

438
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:09,320
company that has calculated the hash all

439
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:12,529
that's left is the hash I don't know if

440
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,119
this is gonna be a hint first you'll

441
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,830
have to say do you accept the question

442
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,970
are you going to pass I'm going to

443
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,970
accept the question there

444
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:22,009
Turner's there is is this an exclusive

445
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,749
or an inclusive or that can be important

446
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:30,440
well you always have to remember he

447
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:32,119
plays against you yeah yeah so now would

448
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,889
be the moment for you to answer the

449
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,619
question well we just talked about the

450
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:38,090
SSA 255 6 hashes and said that that's

451
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:41,629
it's actually in a one-way route there's

452
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:45,168
no way back vanished so in that regard

453
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:47,689
you can't get back from to the phone

454
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:49,220
numbers from the hash that's what you

455
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,590
said when we went with other questions

456
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,679
did I say that that hashes cannot be

457
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:57,470
reversed so you say it's anonymous no

458
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,910
way that's why I'm asking for whom and

459
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,980
not for whom is it

460
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,690
because the number that cutlass did the

461
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,630
company that calculates us has just may

462
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,780
still have the key for that lying around

463
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,660
and could reverse it there are other

464
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:17,120
keys with hashes there are no keys my

465
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:19,590
dying I I was thinking of cryptography

466
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,060
they're not salted and not peppered

467
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:27,570
either definitely I have been debating

468
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:30,030
with many people whether hash is still

469
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,740
personal or anonymous and my belief is

470
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,200
that it's anonymous but there's always

471
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:40,440
two different opinions so you decide it

472
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,880
depends yeah the answer is it depends

473
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,610
and we will exclude the Interior

474
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,010
Minister Jose Hoffa okay so question is

475
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,409
this data enormous a person and why and

476
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:51,330
that irritates me this and why because I

477
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,130
would say anonymous but the and why

478
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,000
would only make sense if personal would

479
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,680
be the right answer

480
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,960
no is it a trap well personally I

481
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,140
believe that hashes of this quality are

482
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,800
anonymous data how quickly will you

483
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,790
calculate 10 million hashes back into a

484
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:15,960
phone number I understood endure one

485
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:17,580
hour was the case with sha-256 how many

486
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,770
phone numbers do we have in German it's

487
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,389
not so many I don't know a hundred

488
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:28,700
million a billion maybe so a few seconds

489
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:31,470
you will need so sadly no that's wrong

490
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:34,020
just simply by brute force you can try

491
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,570
out the hash for all the phone numbers

492
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,830
and once you have it you hit it you have

493
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,600
the right number it's a bit more

494
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,250
difficult with passwords but a simple

495
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,919
example and that has been subject to a

496
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:51,050
court decision maybe you've heard of a

497
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,370
facebook custom audience where you can

498
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:58,820
transfer hashes of email addresses to

499
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,820
Facebook and the colleagues in Bavaria

500
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:07,080
prohibited local companies to supply

501
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,390
Facebook customers audiences with

502
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,710
emailed lists and transmitted at the

503
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,570
Facebook of what is it used for

504
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:18,800
it's used by Facebook

505
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:21,050
then these um match which people are

506
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,760
registered with the same images so in

507
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,530
effect the company will give the

508
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,290
information to Facebook that this person

509
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,660
is our customer whether it's by hash or

510
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,490
by direct email address is doesn't

511
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,130
really matter at all because Facebook

512
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,080
can always use the interests of the

513
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,030
customers they know about and calculate

514
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,370
the same hash and that's why these

515
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:45,410
companies were prohibited from from

516
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:47,929
transferring the data and the yeah vary

517
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,120
in Administrative Court the has

518
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:53,330
administered court in Bavaria in Munich

519
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,399
did confirm this decision so hashes of

520
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:59,389
email addresses and phone numbers are

521
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:03,620
personal data okay let's go a bit slow

522
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:05,030
ever so 64 points down that's the

523
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:10,030
difference between plus and minus do you

524
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:14,899
know about it from the 125 right well

525
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:16,190
let's move on the next round right what

526
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,820
is left

527
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:23,150
I think it's andreas turn now you choose

528
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:28,210
okay I'll use information freedom 23 if

529
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:32,870
you know information 23 anonymous

530
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:35,240
application so we're in the area of

531
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,070
freedom of information so it's going to

532
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,340
be the reverse game it's not about what

533
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,770
the state one's knows about it registers

534
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,820
of our data but what we want to know

535
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:49,760
from the state so we ask about data and

536
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:53,570
ask the authorities to hand out data the

537
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,150
question is can I hand submit such an

538
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,889
application anonymously can I submit it

539
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,230
in a way that the authorities does not

540
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,370
know who is applying and does they do

541
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,230
this they'll have to process the

542
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,199
application andreas what do you think is

543
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:08,480
that a question for you or will you pass

544
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,640
well I'll just consider how I will do

545
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,610
this how I would get the read a reply

546
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,920
because with fuckton start that might be

547
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,080
nice idea if I could still then as an

548
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,550
applicant be identifiable I would just

549
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,540
guess and I think that on a beautiful

550
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,540
it's a good question

551
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,879
because well the legal system in Germany

552
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:36,030
there's always feature an applicant I'll

553
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,530
just pass the question on ah he passes

554
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:41,280
it on who wants to answer it 50/50 50/50

555
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:47,340
chance

556
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:50,070
Holly do you say something Ryan smoking

557
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,850
83 okay I'll take it

558
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:58,620
and what's your answer answer that the

559
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:00,870
question is no the application doesn't

560
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,489
cannot be processed further if the

561
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,959
applicant is anonymous I don't know if I

562
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,270
should do it it need to give a reason no

563
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,940
no you don't have to because it's

564
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:15,810
actually wrong so 23 points deducted

565
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:18,240
negative you know mandamus phone you can

566
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,949
submit few information requests

567
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,439
anonymously many authorities do not know

568
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:25,020
this many authorities will then ask who

569
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,600
are you and you can respond no you

570
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:33,570
cannot ask that anonymous applications

571
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:35,850
work but the state laws are improved in

572
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,890
quotes because anonymous applications

573
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,949
are being forbidden in certain German

574
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:43,529
federal states that is quite mean but

575
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:46,319
that's the exception to the rule the

576
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,880
rule is that applications can be handed

577
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,100
in and honestly if you use a fact in

578
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,960
start the website the one on website

579
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,290
they are offering that service of

580
00:34:51,960 --> 00:35:00,120
handing in your request anonymously back

581
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:12,060
to the fun you can now choose okay I'll

582
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:15,120
choose the 128th common data leaks start

583
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:21,960
and panin cremated yeah we often hear

584
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:29,060
about data leaks and we often very often

585
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:32,490
hear about this who which were lost or

586
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,970
CC BCC errors and emails or hacker

587
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,970
attacks

588
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:42,260
but the most common thing is missing

589
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:45,350
here what's the most common things ended

590
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:55,760
the email it's often this is clear CC

591
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:58,790
BCC is clear because the recipients see

592
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,480
all the other recipients and check

593
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:04,550
attacks are hard to explain but you know

594
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,320
these are the most common except for the

595
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,980
really most common one that's still

596
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:14,660
missing so everyone thinks about where

597
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:16,490
is the most common Dayton link facility

598
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,670
email I guess the first thing would be

599
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:27,709
not encrypted emails and encrypted

600
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:31,640
emails I shouldn't ask questions how how

601
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:38,510
they're reported or how they actually

602
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:45,740
happen so by the GDP our data leaks have

603
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:48,580
to be registered reported and also the

604
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:51,799
[Music]

605
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:55,730
things that the company did so that it

606
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,880
won't happen in the future couple of

607
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,340
other things

608
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,420
Oh delicious for example if we say that

609
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:08,180
doesn't suffice this passive is on the

610
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:15,100
sofa so which so which is the most

611
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:20,839
common way for data leaks to happen I

612
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:25,850
would guess loss of personal data but

613
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,530
that's a data leak okay how how did this

614
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:32,600
happen

615
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:41,090
what activity led to this I guess hacker

616
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:43,270
attack is also undefined the right

617
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:46,869
solution isn't on the part yeah no I

618
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:51,799
guess it's companies that

619
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:58,640
accidentally leaked email or hazard data

620
00:37:51,799 --> 00:38:00,259
to github account networks if caught

621
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:08,769
some thug enough that's who as I still

622
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:14,359
have a question you say data leaks also

623
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:19,038
and under median Dean DeHoff well then I

624
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:22,848
guess it's just business card exchanging

625
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:25,700
a business card it's just business dates

626
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:28,460
and business cards that are exchanged

627
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:37,038
and that happens there so the real

628
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:43,569
answer is I'm looking for it but

629
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:43,569
everyone knows it right it's it's the

630
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,649
the sending of personal data to the

631
00:38:49,009 --> 00:39:00,140
wrong recipients it might be wrongly

632
00:38:51,650 --> 00:39:04,039
addressed mail email or a fax all of

633
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:13,089
these happen very often hundreds of

634
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:18,109
thousands of times we wanted to send the

635
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:22,519
prescription to the pharmacy but we sent

636
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:26,598
it to the wrong person it wasn't in

637
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:30,709
there in all your answers so I guess we

638
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:35,479
won't deduct points from anyone so maybe

639
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:38,239
as background that's just the most

640
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:44,479
simple thing thing that can happen for

641
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:51,089
example doctors that send the reports to

642
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:55,910
the wrong often recipient cheeks

643
00:39:51,089 --> 00:40:01,339
it doesn't really matter I mean how many

644
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,339
possible recipients are there that's

645
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:14,460
they say it isn't really high-risk move

646
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:19,560
on by add up so yeah use you still have

647
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:22,079
to and from the actual victims of the

648
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,549
data leak but most people don't do that

649
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,190
can I tell you an anecdote I'm I have

650
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:32,070
contacts with some of the people who are

651
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:40,740
involved with this and then I talked

652
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:48,810
about exactly this example and then what

653
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:52,109
happens if the doctor what happens if

654
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:55,470
the if you sent the wrong report the

655
00:40:52,109 --> 00:41:00,750
reports of the wrong person and two of

656
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:06,959
the people who were there just happens

657
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:08,880
to them so when in conclusion this

658
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,510
really happens way too often

659
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:17,910
so andreas asked what happens with these

660
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:26,099
data leaks so people have to report them

661
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:32,490
the data leaks to us so that's article

662
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:39,890
34 35 of the GD P R if it happens to

663
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:43,348
bigger groups it depends on how the the

664
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:47,250
report is delivered to the effect that

665
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:50,730
people sometimes you have to think about

666
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:57,019
fine if it if the data leak was really

667
00:41:50,730 --> 00:42:03,329
severe that reminds me

668
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:08,749
it's 34 and 33 and that 35 in the radio

669
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:12,749
here but email encryption that's that's

670
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:14,640
something I really like because that's a

671
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:21,979
data leak that probably happens a lot

672
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:28,078
but yeah okay okay

673
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:29,879
1024 also but if I actually wanted data

674
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,460
face but we'd never had the question

675
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:41,029
mark so I picked that so what's behind

676
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:42,739
that question mark 1024 oh right risk

677
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:52,319
risk

678
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:54,660
so I'll just fix this do I have to look

679
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,029
at this whole stuff now no that won't

680
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,640
help you at all right sorry I don't know

681
00:42:57,029 --> 00:43:02,269
the question myself I haven't got I

682
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,269
hadn't didn't

683
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:12,440
memorize it okay whether it was template

684
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:12,440
I have to expand it fastest is not hot

685
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:19,200
okay now I can reload I just have to be

686
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,650
fog away it's tough I thought that was

687
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,649
the question

688
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:31,170
all right can you just tell a story or

689
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:36,840
something so we had question mark 1024

690
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:40,290
oh yeah that's a little movie that you

691
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:47,900
are about that you should show now show

692
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:52,650
us a movie by mr. K from be risk

693
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:57,320
instructions in which areas can the

694
00:43:52,650 --> 00:44:01,560
federal data protection commissioner

695
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:04,470
instruct the data Commission the federal

696
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:08,420
states data protection commissioner's in

697
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,419
determine federal states in which areas

698
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:20,640
okay a question like it maybe one or

699
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:24,480
other will recognize this guy no that's

700
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:27,900
not bad I just have to search that video

701
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:32,250
that wasn't the plan to show it now and

702
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:34,800
what is risk risk yeah what does it mean

703
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:38,250
risk means that you have to choose how

704
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:43,560
many points of your 1,024 you want to

705
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:47,970
gamble all of them you could gamble 1000

706
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:56,160
only four points if you had do- points

707
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:59,189
exist both ask mueslix my expansive

708
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,370
still 23 do you want to gamble all of

709
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,370
them

710
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:10,379
he'll end at zero and that will be it

711
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:12,240
but if you get out of it

712
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,430
so for 23 points we'll just listen

713
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,859
closely that's the German Data

714
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,509
Protection Commissioner all this cover

715
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,760
my name is Alec ever I am the German

716
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:25,170
data protection commissioner I turned it

717
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,720
down Thomas let's restart no right

718
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,120
my name is Alice Kober I'm the German

719
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,620
Data Protection Commissioner for theft

720
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,990
protection and freedom information now

721
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,450
my question about gdpr and the Data

722
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:38,899
Protection Act in which areas can the

723
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:42,660
German data protection commissioner

724
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,980
instructs the federal states data

725
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,899
protection Commission's not that I heard

726
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,900
this but it was in the slide earlier

727
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,210
maybe we should add that these 1024

728
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,620
point questions were all rather

729
00:45:54,210 --> 00:46:05,730
difficult now the question of course is

730
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:11,970
you have 10 seconds ok I can't know that

731
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:15,330
long the question mr. Keval was in which

732
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:17,700
areas can the federal data protection

733
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:19,950
commissioner instruct the German federal

734
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:24,390
state data protection commissioners what

735
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:29,750
areas actually exist by which illegal

736
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:41,129
air is legal issues you could say which

737
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:44,700
issues the instruction be made maybe we

738
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:48,150
can give a hint about the number of

739
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:53,259
areas of the binary numbers there are

740
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:59,420
many options there No

741
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:02,540
no forget that hint nope yes so today

742
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:07,820
not what corner now you you should reach

743
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:12,890
your answer audience Joker great do you

744
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:16,250
still have this okay how should we do it

745
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:18,830
does anyone know let's look through the

746
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,660
audience the angel with the microphone

747
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:24,200
will now look for someone who knows and

748
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:27,319
otherwise we'll just vote because

749
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,629
obviously who wants to step into the

750
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,640
breach for muesli he will have to of

751
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,230
course decide whether he will accept the

752
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,960
answer someone is showing up in the very

753
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:42,020
back office did okay where was that

754
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,920
raised hand let's hope that we found

755
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:49,430
someone who knows it's a clearly

756
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,490
answerable question well since I haven't

757
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:58,368
got so many points to lose I will say

758
00:47:52,490 --> 00:48:05,359
zero yes correct answer so 1024 points

759
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:09,740
for muesli no no no no 23 23 he only had

760
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:13,730
23 points to gamble yes it was the risk

761
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:16,040
question you had to gamble a certain

762
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,710
number of points because that question

763
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,450
was far too simple for 1,024 he was it

764
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,540
was because someone knew the answer so

765
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:25,399
now let's explain the federal data

766
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,320
Protection Commissioner has no relation

767
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,940
to the federal state datum additional

768
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,859
commissioners they're different errors

769
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:34,070
the federal identification Commissioner

770
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:36,410
is many tasks with federal authorities

771
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,000
and the 30 prediction there and the

772
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,649
federal state debt petitioners are

773
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,339
involved with debt reduction at the

774
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:46,820
federal state organizations authorities

775
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:49,609
and also have supervision about private

776
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:51,740
enterprises so they deal with everything

777
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:54,200
that takes place in terms of private

778
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,000
data processing the federal date of a

779
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,009
detection Commissioner has a small area

780
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,730
where he will deal with

781
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:03,380
telecommunication law but mainly the

782
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,599
areas of supervision are completely

783
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,470
separate so he has nothing to tell us

784
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,390
and we

785
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,720
have nothing to tell him so the answer

786
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:14,330
zero is completely right and it was

787
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:19,459
there's no area which instructions can

788
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:20,960
be made okay great miss you can now

789
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,020
choose the next question we'll have to

790
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:28,310
speed things up a bit

791
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,849
okay hacker which number how much you

792
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:33,710
again

793
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:40,490
okay I'll choose 24 yeah you're really

794
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:45,369
on a roll here risk again how much do

795
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:47,359
you wanna bet all 64 points or I really

796
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:50,270
didn't come up with a hacker question

797
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,170
that I was sure that no one could answer

798
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:56,450
[Music]

799
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:59,510
wait wait okay I have to tell you

800
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,950
something this is a risk question how

801
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:05,030
many questions how many points do you

802
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:07,299
wanna bet 64 okay I first have to tell

803
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,300
the story

804
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:18,619
HRM member of the company has a suit

805
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:23,900
case in a car it was a locked case in a

806
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:28,790
locked car the suitcase was lost or

807
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:33,910
rather stolen including the laptop ten

808
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:39,020
days later the company receives

809
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:40,580
blackmail please send us X number of

810
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:45,080
bitcoins for in the hundreds of

811
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:48,170
thousands at the address below and the

812
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:51,109
blackmailer was sending personal data

813
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:55,640
that was on that laptop so hit our

814
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:59,869
payroll information and 24 hours later

815
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,500
the company reports the data breach data

816
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:06,960
leak

817
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:11,040
can the governance organization the

818
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:15,560
supervising authority impose its calm

819
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:18,509
cough a pin penalty so the question is

820
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:24,360
what's the reasoning who do they have to

821
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:28,050
inform do you want to solve it can the

822
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:30,020
supervising body impose a penalty do I

823
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:34,890
have to have to solve all of them

824
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:37,550
okay I'm passing what's your name

825
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,960
yeah the name is e Catholic I'll take it

826
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:43,500
but then you you only get six four

827
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,590
points right because he bent 64 what why

828
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:51,920
am I getting his points half moon so

829
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:51,920
good okay I'm gonna go back to zero okay

830
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:57,290
okay I only got some fifty something so

831
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:08,220
can the supervisory authority impose a

832
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:13,550
penalty yes because usually after 24

833
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:13,549
hours the breach has to be reported and

834
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:20,310
either there was a bad cryptography on

835
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:22,050
it even if they got the laptop obviously

836
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:25,470
they could read it so that's a problem

837
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:29,970
in itself the company has to a minimum

838
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:32,189
inform the the body because there is a

839
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:34,589
HR or rather personally identifiable

840
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:38,310
information on it for example

841
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:41,820
health-related information so I would

842
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:44,640
assume that the relevant people had the

843
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:48,870
data on their laptop so all of them have

844
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:54,450
to be informed yeah I'm glad I didn't

845
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:57,810
take that question yeah I really think

846
00:52:54,450 --> 00:53:00,779
we can avoid all 64 points to her okay

847
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:03,060
next question next round what do we

848
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,670
learn from this yes encrypt your load

849
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:08,220
books otherwise this could be very

850
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:11,730
expensive it happens all the time it's

851
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:13,200
not just laptops also stationery desktop

852
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,660
computers

853
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,259
so it's really not that hard anymore to

854
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,240
encrypt it

855
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,690
yeah please also encrypt all of the USB

856
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,220
sticks and if you find a USB stick on

857
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:28,000
the parking lot and please don't just

858
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:31,169
put it into the slot you can choose

859
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,170

states in Germany do not have an

872
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,019
information of Freedom Act yet I want to

873
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:31,288

874
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:32,788

thank you I'll donate somebody okay now

943
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:44,750
let's take something I surely don't know

944
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:47,839
a hacker 42 changing passwords - a

945
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:53,119
Zoltan after which period of time admins

946
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:57,828
should make users change their passwords

947
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:09,470
how often how often should passwords be

948
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:13,000
changed so actually in - oh there we go

949
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:17,720
the standard term was three months but

950
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:21,680
since for shortly it's just regarding

951
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:24,020
any issues any incidents or so maybe

952
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,940
there is no time period at all because

953
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,940
short timers will lead to people of

954
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:36,020
writing passwords down and fitting them

955
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:38,000
to the screen either correct and if your

956
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:40,549
admin in your company somewhere tells

957
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,270
you to change your passwords every 30 or

958
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:46,910
90 days or something then point them to

959
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:49,609
our password guidelines which you can

960
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:51,890
get from our website where it says no

961
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:56,180
you shouldn't enforce password changes

962
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:59,720
only if there is a reason an occasion so

963
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:02,089
that was as many as how many was that 42

964
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:06,308
points right yes

965
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:10,009
42 points you'll keep the tally you can

966
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:13,720
do sums above a thousand surely cutting

967
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:19,230
just continue well maybe someone else

968
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:21,879
you can pass on the question okay

969
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:26,110
mmm informations finite reading with

970
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:30,580
evasion 128 in freedom of information

971
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:33,940
and human rights or basic rights a lie

972
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:36,400
still in question is their basic rights

973
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:39,790
to freedom of information in Germany

974
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,250
we've all learned that the right to

975
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:45,430
informational self-determination is a

976
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:47,860
basic right as determined by the German

977
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:50,169
Federal Constitutional Court but the

978
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,040
right to get information from

979
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,450
authorities

980
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,029
Kathleen's good that there you are a

981
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:59,319
legal expert is that a basic right I

982
01:01:55,030 --> 01:02:01,840
pass that's a clever decision and I

983
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:07,030
guess I'll take that question and I'll

984
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:09,160
say no because it's not in the basic law

985
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,510
in the Constitution but it's in the

986
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:14,710
Freedom of Information Law which is a

987
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:18,280
federal law but not a basic law nice try

988
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:20,230
but sadly wrong in freedom of

989
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,470
information is a basic right it's an

990
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:25,360
article 5 of the Constitution where it

991
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:27,180
says that people can inform themselves

992
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:33,310
from public sources what you said about

993
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:37,390
the interplay between state laws which

994
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:42,310
are the FOI laws and German basic rights

995
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:45,339
at the time a state passes a freedom

996
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:47,440
information law that the the data

997
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,210
becomes a public source and you then

998
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,610
have a constitutional right to access

999
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:56,640
that source so sadly we have to deduct

1000
01:02:51,610 --> 01:03:02,550
points from you 128 you still have any

1001
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:05,950
no so 0 points we have 2 people forget 0

1002
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:09,700
you are out and only how's he doing

1003
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:12,339
92 so everything's still open and in the

1004
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,540
running there because you gave such a

1005
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:17,980
nice answer you can choose the next

1006
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:21,160
question what do you want out what do

1007
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:24,350
you choose done name

1008
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:31,940
I'll take hacker 64

1009
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:37,009
so he hack a 64 job well and we have a

1010
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:38,660
hacker attack an attacker took the email

1011
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:42,620
address of a customer of an online shop

1012
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:45,140
and copied it fellas

1013
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:49,250
three important measures that the shop

1014
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:53,480
owner has to take now you wanna solved

1015
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:56,030
and yes so the first two I would

1016
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:05,240
probably come up with but the third I'll

1017
01:03:56,030 --> 01:04:07,940
just pass so who wants this off now ok

1018
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,640
I'll take it off Lincoln in for me yeah

1019
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:16,100
they have to inform the customers they

1020
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:21,279
have to inform the authorities and they

1021
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:21,279
have to invalidate the login credentials

1022
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,810
well I was actually waiting for a

1023
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:31,540
different one but yeah that's ok that's

1024
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:35,690
alright given the points this estêvão

1025
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:39,800
Emma so the first one would have been

1026
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:40,430
yeah well obviously mitigate the problem

1027
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,500
ie

1028
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:49,549
solved the leak or the the the threat

1029
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:51,710
vector so how many points was that von

1030
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:57,710
glowers check off yes TJ was 64 right

1031
01:04:51,710 --> 01:05:01,520
yeah 64 or so you can also choose the

1032
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:07,520
next category now well we still have to

1033
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:12,050
do fake news can we look at no I'll take

1034
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:14,589
the 128 it's time Joe okay it's a joker

1035
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:18,440
nice

1036
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:21,578
yet Kassadin Alicia didn't tidy ageles

1037
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,579
so snake eaters powers

1038
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:35,118
okay I'll try Jacques I don't know that

1039
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:39,380
data leaks 23 ha that's a stable scale

1040
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:45,170
twist so the first fine imposed on a

1041
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:48,849
company in Germany so since the latest

1042
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:54,369
change in the law and the fines were

1043
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:58,579
raised massively so there was a first

1044
01:05:54,369 --> 01:06:00,980
fine imposed by the the state

1045
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:06,260
Commissioner for data protection and

1046
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:06,770
button looking back so what was that

1047
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:09,650
about

1048
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:12,500
what was the first fine done for it was

1049
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:13,010
on Heiser obviously no one wants to have

1050
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,760
its own

1051
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:19,270
it was the platform called snoodles what

1052
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:23,720
they did was they had unencrypted

1053
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:27,530
passwords on a database and it was 80

1054
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:31,549
thousand euro zone 20 it was twenty

1055
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:35,410
thousand years as a fine for having

1056
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:39,799
clear text passwords saved in their

1057
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:40,910
database that were copied today is it

1058
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:43,880
possible for me to know that website

1059
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:44,390
with my age well it depends it could be

1060
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,580
difficult

1061
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:49,000
it depends can we ask you for your age

1062
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:53,390
[Music]

1063
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:57,980
Corsi offer knows about it so 23 points

1064
01:06:53,390 --> 01:07:00,400
 happened okay you're calculating

1065
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,400
right

1066
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:13,959
theta fails 42 plus symbol this is a

1067
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:16,059
class book class and ball translator

1068
01:07:13,959 --> 01:07:19,989
doesn't know the register the

1069
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:23,130
translation of it's a book where the

1070
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:37,749
behavior of pupils is registered by the

1071
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:39,749
teacher at school section agency the

1072
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:45,488
class book has been lost

1073
01:07:39,749 --> 01:07:54,189
do I have to report they'll fail what is

1074
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:56,949
a very good question I have to ask the

1075
01:07:54,189 --> 01:07:59,160
colleagues come here can somebody help

1076
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:59,160
me

1077
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:07,408
register lose Katrien you wanna solve

1078
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:10,709
Amanda countertop truly intertube fingon

1079
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:14,569
this is a clarity - in the elementary

1080
01:08:10,709 --> 01:08:14,569
school in the topping and

1081
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:28,009
some Barbie registers who's there and

1082
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:31,380
who was missing I'd say very difficult

1083
01:08:28,009 --> 01:08:33,689
normally I'd say okay there's no

1084
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:42,769
automated data processing it's just in a

1085
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:47,729
book but it's systematic its class books

1086
01:08:42,769 --> 01:08:50,640
the epitome of systematic order that's

1087
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:55,788
right and that's full marks for Katrina

1088
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:57,900
[Applause]

1089
01:08:55,788 --> 01:09:01,078
as additional out of Matty's year

1090
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:02,848
forever I did that zone and also gdpr

1091
01:09:01,078 --> 01:09:05,038
does not just protect automatically

1092
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:07,889
register data but all kinds of data that

1093
01:09:05,038 --> 01:09:11,899
are systematically collected and

1094
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:14,429
completely rightly is it that the the

1095
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:15,868
systematic order of information in a

1096
01:09:14,429 --> 01:09:18,210
class register is something you can

1097
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:20,189
imagine so that is a breach that has to

1098
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:23,189
be reported and if that would be a

1099
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:24,808
repeated problem at the primary and

1100
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:26,729
secondary school of hinter tipping and

1101
01:09:24,809 --> 01:09:31,710
we would have to look into that and see

1102
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:34,379
if maybe we need to do something more my

1103
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:37,739
fagot okay let's take the question marks

1104
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:41,460
again 128 question mark hundred and

1105
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:44,058
twenty-eight now that is an urn has been

1106
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,059
washed ashore

1107
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:53,690
I registered either do you like to tell

1108
01:09:47,929 --> 01:10:00,770
the story at a beach an urn washes

1109
01:09:53,689 --> 01:10:04,730
ashore and the number of the of the

1110
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:09,199
cremation can be found read on the urn

1111
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:13,308
is that personal data the cremation

1112
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:16,159
number may be registered in some kind of

1113
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:20,150
list somewhere and that might lead to

1114
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:23,409
the to the name of the deceased now

1115
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:23,409
captain would you like to solve this

1116
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:34,010
you're conferring that is quite

1117
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:36,380
perfidious videos yes I just wanted to

1118
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:38,329
see if I should pass on the question to

1119
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:46,250
someone who would stand a few points

1120
01:10:38,329 --> 01:10:48,679
with it but in some cemetery register

1121
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:53,000
that is not very unique well but the

1122
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:55,340
person in this urn is dead mostly that

1123
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,500
is the case yes sir and and gdpr would

1124
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:01,090
only protect living people great cutting

1125
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,670
marks

1126
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:09,469
120 points to cut him add that to the

1127
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:12,800
tally that is the fact and they the gdpr

1128
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:15,050
does not apply to deceased people that

1129
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:21,530
is the lesson to learn from this

1130
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:25,429
question next question okay let's finish

1131
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:27,259
off it information so if your

1132
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:29,869
information 42

1133
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:34,760
it's a guesstimation question for

1134
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:38,299
everybody on swab so everybody has to do

1135
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,610
a guesstimate and the question is how

1136
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:45,770
many countries in the world have Freedom

1137
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:48,440
of Information Act so there is free

1138
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:52,429
information I'm gonna give you there are

1139
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:54,799
roughly 193 countries in the world so

1140
01:11:52,429 --> 01:11:57,500
the question is how many of those have

1141
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:01,080
passed a feat of an Information Act

1142
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:06,060
bein a strap is what one who's closest

1143
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:07,590
gets the full marks shitless you might

1144
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:19,580
find my octant from sake I'm gonna

1145
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:19,580
choose 58 I'm gonna say Bree okay 42

1146
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:29,600
what happens if I also say 42 no well

1147
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:33,450
then we do a tie breaker

1148
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:39,600
so for tactical reasons maybe choose 41

1149
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:45,510
or 43 so he chooses 43 clear victory for

1150
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:50,070
Andreas it is a hundred and thirty

1151
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:51,210
you've done a boat so with your 58 you

1152
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:56,240
were actually pretty bad but you're

1153
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:58,980
still closest so four points for Andreas

1154
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:04,950
is a category also and you may choose

1155
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:12,360
the next category poke ring and using

1156
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:15,840
data failed 1024 it's Castillo's maximum

1157
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:20,519
fine what about if Archdiocese the

1158
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:27,060
question is how I exactly is a maximum

1159
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:28,780
fine for an non reported data fail beats

1160
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,420
to lose

1161
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:35,179
each named alpha you wanna solve a bully

1162
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:37,900
and it a happen virtually to escape I

1163
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:39,800
have an idea but I'm still gonna use my

1164
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:43,009
audience Joker

1165
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,540
I'm pretty sure that some people that

1166
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:51,650
several people know the exact number

1167
01:13:46,540 --> 01:14:02,449
this always thought that so who can help

1168
01:13:51,650 --> 01:14:08,780
andreas andreas you choose million four

1169
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:11,480
percent of revenue yearly revenue for

1170
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:14,900
twenty million whatever is higher I'm

1171
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:20,030
sorry I didn't get the number let me buy

1172
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:23,860
this fresh it's both wrong my poor

1173
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:28,759
sensitive it's two percent of your

1174
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:35,210
yearly revenue he's laughing

1175
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:37,520
Andrea's the rules are if they are you

1176
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:42,969
just lost thousands and twenty four

1177
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:49,090
points your own folds the maximum fine

1178
01:14:42,969 --> 01:14:54,880
is the so-called small fine

1179
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:54,880
real bad arrows costs four percent

1180
01:14:54,969 --> 01:15:03,290
formal errors costs two percent of

1181
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:07,849
revenue yearly revenue ten million is

1182
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:11,030
the I would say this vid five yards at

1183
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:17,210
swell lower limit maximally boo scared

1184
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:25,099
that's one thing that's very good but

1185
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:30,949
lost all points you may choose okay go

1186
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:34,429
high and take 1024 again GDP are so that

1187
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:38,509
is my favorite question I'm not gonna

1188
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:41,779
spill it I spoil it just ask the

1189
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:44,659
question when did the GDP are

1190
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:48,199
come into force we would like the exact

1191
01:15:44,659 --> 01:15:53,598
date please the guy owns 1/6 on my 23rd

1192
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:56,509
of May 2018 this is that it's quite a

1193
01:15:53,599 --> 01:16:00,909
good answer I would have said 25th of

1194
01:15:56,509 --> 01:16:03,939
May made 2018 big sounds very good but

1195
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:06,829
unfortunately it's wrong 24th of May

1196
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:11,019
2016 but I would have said oh oh is it

1197
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:15,529
25th of May 2016 is May correct well

1198
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:17,419
decide anyway it's about 2016 we are not

1199
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:21,709
happy with just a year we want the exact

1200
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:23,989
date one will give us the months the

1201
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:29,539
other the date and the earth person the

1202
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:33,888
year 21st of May would anyone else like

1203
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:38,059
to lose all their points would you like

1204
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:41,689
to solve this so are you going to chat

1205
01:16:38,059 --> 01:16:44,959
it will be in force as it is published

1206
01:16:41,689 --> 01:16:48,469
in the European register right and that

1207
01:16:44,959 --> 01:16:52,938
was in 2016 that was when the date of

1208
01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:55,159
the gdpr was finalized the negotiations

1209
01:16:52,939 --> 01:16:56,809
and it was then published in the

1210
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:01,219
register of laws and that's when it came

1211
01:16:56,809 --> 01:17:03,379
into force it wasn't a 25th of May 2018

1212
01:17:01,219 --> 01:17:06,799
that was the moment when it became

1213
01:17:03,379 --> 01:17:11,179
effective it was in force it was out

1214
01:17:06,799 --> 01:17:13,759
there but it became effective at on the

1215
01:17:11,179 --> 01:17:15,829
25th of May 2018 we asked about the

1216
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:19,369
coming into force and that in fact will

1217
01:17:15,829 --> 01:17:22,599
see yes now wasn't it something strange

1218
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:26,389
like the 5th 45th day after publication

1219
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:27,709
so that's that's nineteen nine right now

1220
01:17:26,389 --> 01:17:30,229
you only need to know what the fifth

1221
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:34,759
45th day after application was oh come

1222
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:36,949
on the 1,024 questions are extremely

1223
01:17:34,759 --> 01:17:40,099
hard so I would suggest that you would

1224
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:43,518
not want to pass answer question yes all

1225
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:48,859
right about which day in May was it it

1226
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:52,579
was the 24th 24th on the 20th day after

1227
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:54,660
publication in the register it was

1228
01:17:52,579 --> 01:18:00,980
published on the 4th of May

1229
01:17:54,660 --> 01:18:05,370
16th 16th or 17th of May it was passed

1230
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:07,379
it comes even I say 24th of May 2000 yes

1231
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:10,019
you did but you then decided not to

1232
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:16,770
answer the question oh you are evil we

1233
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:18,300
are the supervisors of your authority at

1234
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:25,370
least you get to choose the next

1235
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:32,010
question ok I'm gonna choose hackers 128

1236
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:39,269
ok hacker 128 another Joker oh wow ok

1237
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:46,910
are you still keeping track getting

1238
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:52,590
close ok ok let's choose question marks

1239
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:59,300
64 so this is about scoring and your

1240
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:59,300
residential address is it allowed to use

1241
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:05,490
the information that the person lives in

1242
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:08,460
a high-rise building when calculating

1243
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:13,219
the score value and if it's detrimental

1244
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:16,560
to the score that the person gets so

1245
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:18,540
these kind of scoring systems they try

1246
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:23,760
to determine if you're solvent if you

1247
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:25,380
can pay for your bills so there are

1248
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,500
companies like safar that's the most

1249
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:30,720
important one that creates a score and

1250
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:33,150
the question now is if they calculate

1251
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:35,220
the score are they allowed to take into

1252
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:39,240
account the effect that they're living

1253
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:41,850
in a high-rise building so for example

1254
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:45,150
if someone lives in a detached house or

1255
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:47,790
in a semi-detached house that's probably

1256
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:51,990
a better value this location do you want

1257
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:54,230
to answer I'm passing so please choose

1258
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:56,820
someone who actually has asked already I

1259
01:19:54,230 --> 01:20:03,030
probably already have a free bed score

1260
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:05,179
but I'd say in principle yes it's

1261
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:08,690
probably disallowed

1262
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:10,550
to choose the residential address but in

1263
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:12,559
this particular case is not about your

1264
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:15,290
dress itself but rather about some

1265
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:19,190
property of that so in this case I'd say

1266
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:21,980
yes this is something we can count yeah

1267
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:25,580
it is allowed to count that information

1268
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:30,230
there is another problem it's not

1269
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:33,290
allowed to choose to calculate this

1270
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:35,660
score with just this information if

1271
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:40,100
someone thinks this is unfair please

1272
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:42,110
write to the sofa so I just want to say

1273
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,060
that I've asked the shoe for before how

1274
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:46,610
they calculate the score and I'm still

1275
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:49,790
waiting for the answer there is actually

1276
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:52,580
very interesting they're just very

1277
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:55,760
interesting ruling by the Constitutional

1278
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:57,860
Court and they say that this is a trade

1279
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,290
secret of the shoe feh and they don't

1280
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:02,000
have to tell you we actually have the

1281
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:06,680
open shoe portfolio and they should

1282
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,680
actually have to they could force them

1283
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,720
to come up with the secret and yeah this

1284
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,810
is another one of those things where we

1285
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,030
use fact in stat and we want to

1286
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:21,140
encourage you to participate in this to

1287
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:22,849
give them some some more questions that

1288
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:25,940
I can ask to the state where they can

1289
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:28,190
try to figure out a method for creating

1290
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:35,440
this score by the sofa so andreas your

1291
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:41,690
turn well there's not much left

1292
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:44,200
choosing fake news 64 true or false and

1293
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:44,200
why

1294
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:53,900
this site adapters good for a parameter

1295
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:58,930
de Clichy de new landlords have to screw

1296

finished as airship andreas says no they

1306
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:41,170
don't have to be removed 64 points for

1307
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:46,370
Andrea's correct other marks book minute

1308
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:50,830
his double shield is still there if it

1309
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:55,849
sounds silly it's not data protection

1310
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:58,940
it's your turn ok I'll just take the

1311
01:22:55,850 --> 01:23:01,010
three question marks 23 actually there's

1312
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:03,679
a exclamation mark in there to question

1313
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:07,370
mark or exclamation mark 23 photos

1314
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:09,830
okay we're dealing with photos again is

1315
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:14,000
the audience allowed to take photos from

1316
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:17,390
us of us on the stage here well

1317
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,130
according to camp regulations come on

1318
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:21,610
held on and rest would you like to

1319
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:25,030
answer question I would answer yes

1320
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:30,620
because we are part of a public event

1321
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:33,070
with respective consent is that your

1322
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:33,070
final answer

1323
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:44,010
well it's only 23 points so yes I'll

1324
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:48,140
stick with it I will accept that yeah

1325
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:51,270
I just wanted to raise the tension a bit

1326
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:54,210
yes would have been enough even if the

1327
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:56,130
introduction meeting said that if you

1328
01:23:54,210 --> 01:24:02,120
have to ask before taking questions yes

1329
01:23:56,130 --> 01:24:02,120
but that is House law or House Rules

1330
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:07,620
organizers can say that you can only

1331
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,810
take a photos after you've called out

1332
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:11,309
the German interior minister wholesale

1333
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:13,020
help us name three times they are

1334
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:15,930
allowed to do that but what is legally

1335
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,670
permissible is another question and

1336
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:19,440
legally yes of course it is allowed to

1337
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:21,390
take photos of anyone you want the

1338
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,660
question the problem only arises when

1339
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:26,070
you want to distribute those photos and

1340
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:28,530
that's where data protection comes in

1341
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:32,730
but beforehand taking photos is fully

1342
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:36,200
allowed difficult question because many

1343
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:39,179
out of fear or ignorance starts to

1344
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:42,300
prohibit taking photos in schools for

1345
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:43,880
example and so scoot over to save you're

1346
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,830
not allowed to take photos anymore

1347
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:49,560
completely superfluous that's nothing to

1348
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:51,000
do with data protection at all you can

1349
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,530
take photos of your own children and

1350
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,600
other people's children as long as you

1351
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:56,790
don't publish them online what is

1352
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,010
prohibited is publishing those photos

1353
01:24:56,790 --> 01:25:00,989
without consent by the parents for

1354
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:03,930
example but the actual taking of photos

1355
01:25:00,989 --> 01:25:07,500
is always allowed very little too small

1356
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:09,120
restriction if you somewhere photograph

1357
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:13,470
of your neighbors in secret through

1358
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:15,330
their bedroom window that is probably a

1359
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,860
breach of first knowledge right but in

1360
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,440
terms of data protection you can take

1361
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:21,839
photos much you want take keep them to

1362
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,339
yourselves you can look at them as often

1363
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,650
as you want but as soon as you want to

1364
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:28,770
publish them online you have to obtain

1365
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:30,929
consent or have to have to have a

1366
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:35,430
contractual basis or something like that

1367
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:37,440
so we have a public event here well so

1368
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,760
public for an entrance fee of two

1369
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,099
hundred ninety five years I think that

1370
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,410
is everyone well public doesn't mean it

1371
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:47,640
has to be free of charge it just has to

1372
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:49,730
be that people can participate on a

1373
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:52,200
general basis even in a public bath

1374
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:53,549
where there's an entrance fee this is a

1375
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,620
part of a place we're talking about the

1376
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:56,819
data protection law of though not about

1377
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,049
the rights to your own

1378
01:25:56,819 --> 01:26:00,049
image or something that's because I'm

1379
01:25:58,049 --> 01:26:03,419
just giving it gaining here and

1380
01:26:00,049 --> 01:26:04,589
credulous glances that is the difference

1381
01:26:03,419 --> 01:26:08,339
between data protection law and

1382
01:26:04,589 --> 01:26:12,149
personality law yes we'll get to almost

1383
01:26:08,339 --> 01:26:17,249
the end we have two questions left is

1384
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:19,019
your turn to choose no matter how much I

1385
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:27,510
get right now you're still ahead of me

1386
01:26:19,019 --> 01:26:35,669
so I'll choose hacker 23 so that's hot

1387
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:40,319
meerschaum oh we had that one okay how

1388
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:42,829
is that possible must be a bug so I

1389
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:45,299
guess I'll choose fake news genifique

1390
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:50,549
news transition how much room is inside

1391
01:26:45,299 --> 01:26:52,709
each part okay so we save ten now just

1392
01:26:50,549 --> 01:27:01,409
to get the point okay true or false and

1393
01:26:52,709 --> 01:27:04,858
why so close the thing of data is only

1394
01:27:01,409 --> 01:27:07,619
valid with the consent of the person

1395
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:11,129
affected so is this statement correct if

1396
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:14,068
I am using the data from some third

1397
01:27:11,129 --> 01:27:18,780
party do I need their consent do you

1398
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:22,169
want to solve andreas so I wish it was

1399
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:24,419
but obviously it's not right because Xu

1400
01:27:22,169 --> 01:27:30,839
Fei wouldn't exist otherwise so yes

1401
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:36,559
answer correct 23 points one is score so

1402
01:27:30,839 --> 01:27:36,559
consent is an important basis but not

1403
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:44,759
always there is a legitimate reason for

1404
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:50,999
example if you waive your rights in a

1405
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:53,249
contractual form so consent is one but

1406
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:55,379
it's not a the central or even the most

1407
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:58,199
important one so that was the second

1408
01:27:55,379 --> 01:28:00,959
round and this is the moment where we

1409
01:27:58,199 --> 01:28:03,780
have to say goodbye to two people so

1410
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:05,960
let's look at the scoreboard so andreas

1411
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:14,099
has how many points now

1412
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:16,710
yes 164 please applaud some fun so how

1413
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:20,330
many does muesli have what that's so

1414
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:24,870
important 110 that's less but still

1415
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:34,620
worthy of an applause so how many does

1416
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:36,510
catch a nap over 9000 over 9000 632 yeah

1417
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:40,650
it looks like you can stay here and how

1418
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:43,500
many does Holly have 92 I'm sorry that's

1419
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:45,900
not enough so that's why we have to say

1420
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:55,200
goodbye to muesli and Ollie with the

1421
01:28:45,900 --> 01:29:00,960
warm applause you getting a consolation

1422
01:28:55,200 --> 01:29:04,470
prize stay there you're gonna come come

1423
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:10,620
back on stage later now to the final of

1424
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:12,630
the two first contestants top

1425
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:19,490
contestants of the first of the second

1426
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:22,710
row of the second round the pumped idiot

1427
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:27,559
points that you're going to get in the

1428
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:29,550
last round are going to be multiplicator

1429
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:31,560
multiplicator pooja OD black

1430
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:33,870
multiplicator boom that has been to kind

1431
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:37,350
of poke the mast but the MFE have no

1432
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:38,880
points which thousands extra panel is

1433
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:45,540
typically and here's one

1434
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:48,480
he gets his result so the first points

1435
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:50,800
to win the first point isn't very

1436
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:54,849
interesting and then it's going

1437
01:29:50,800 --> 01:30:00,010
to be interesting item oh okay you're

1438
01:29:54,850 --> 01:30:04,800
gonna turn off both so completes yet see

1439
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:04,800
it's not so complicated

1440
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:14,590
okay you go both going to be asked my

1441
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:20,040
especially about what kind of video

1442
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:25,240
surveillance are there most complaints

1443
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:31,660
so video which of these draws the most

1444
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:37,050
complaints it a pools be of employees

1445
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:42,269

cotton is one point because most of us

1450
01:30:55,030 --> 01:31:00,639
vanish beard Yuba it's really like that

1451
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:06,760
most complaints about video surveillance

1452
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:12,190
that we get is that I surveyed my

1453
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:16,630
neighbor and either they survey back or

1454
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:20,799
they go to the police complain

1455
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:23,860
absolute LSD reforms country is very

1456
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:26,590
difficult for us as well it's vital

1457
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:29,429
August read a second question and that

1458
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:32,509

1467
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:11,369
let this great woman pass me by one or

1468
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:14,218
two time only chance so I'm now going to

1469
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:17,130
query that number plate in my database

1470
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:20,369
okay now this fake police person here

1471
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:23,639
this fake policeman wasn't ignored

1472
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:26,880
father what is the exact question right

1473
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:30,239
we are dealing with a policeman who has

1474
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:33,690
seen a fantastic woman on in his patrol

1475
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:36,239
and she was in a car with a lamb plate

1476
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:39,178
and he memorized the number plate and

1477
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:42,598
now he has access to the police database

1478
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:46,699
and he goes ahead and looks up the

1479
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:51,510
number plate to find out the name of

1480
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:54,089
that lady the residence maybe contact

1481
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:56,309
details such as mobile phone number and

1482
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:58,559
goes ahead and the question in that

1483
01:32:56,309 --> 01:33:01,650
context is is that police person

1484
01:32:58,559 --> 01:33:04,320
policeman allowed to do this and what

1485
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:07,409
happens to them to him if he goes ahead

1486
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:11,909
and does it now it's Kathleen's turn to

1487
01:33:07,409 --> 01:33:14,879
start first is he allowed no no no well

1488
01:33:11,909 --> 01:33:18,030
he's a policeman police databases are

1489
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:21,960
made for police men yes they're made for

1490
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:24,268
police people if they have a task a case

1491
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:26,760
to process and if they are authorized to

1492
01:33:24,269 --> 01:33:29,110
look at that data I'm sure that he's not

1493
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:33,639
investigating this woman

1494
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:35,739
and the interest does not count but

1495
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:37,150
maybe she went around the bend in

1496
01:33:35,739 --> 01:33:41,759
illegal booze but he didn't say that

1497
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:46,239
true what would happen to him well

1498
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:47,800
trouble with the authorities protection

1499
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:52,330
commissioner and the federal state data

1500
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:53,889
protection commissioner and a fine laugh

1501
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:55,480
at us oh and Jace what do you think is

1502
01:33:53,889 --> 01:33:57,760
he loud and what would happen of course

1503
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,678
not that was in the press recently and

1504
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:03,040
he will receive a fine

1505
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:12,690
nice good you're both correct a point to

1506
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:16,480
both of you applause by the way

1507
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:20,309
according to the GDP our regulation that

1508
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:23,019
was actually a point of contest that

1509
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:26,830
anyone in public service for example for

1510
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:29,679
at least people if it's allowed to give

1511
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:31,600
them a fine or not a lot of people were

1512
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:34,920
of the opinion that this is impossible

1513
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:37,900
but some others also said yeah it is and

1514
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:41,440
offered in this case the police person

1515
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:44,888
received a fine of 1500 years because he

1516
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:50,080
had interest in the person that was not

1517
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:52,360
within the course of the duty and as a

1518
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,760
police person they're always allowed to

1519
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,849
use their respective databases but as a

1520
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:59,400
private person they're not so two points

1521
01:34:57,850 --> 01:35:04,650
one for each of you

1522
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:09,369
it was a question yeah who actually

1523
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:12,099
supervises this so yeah partly us the

1524
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:15,250
question is how do we get notice of this

1525
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:19,710
or how would we suspect this in this

1526
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:22,239
particular case for example if the woman

1527
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:27,670
notices that the person that the police

1528
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:29,739
guy is watching here what how is he able

1529
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:32,860
to call me on my private number they

1530
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:35,769
shouldn't be able to know it and by now

1531
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:37,849
we can talk about this quite openly so

1532
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:43,680
by now the police

1533
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:49,260
databases are now watched with a sort of

1534
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:52,470
a honeypot every access is logged and we

1535
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:55,050
do superficial checks on all of the

1536
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:57,320
requests that are being done maybe every

1537
01:35:55,050 --> 01:36:00,510
hundred or so request is looked at

1538
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:03,630
they're supervised by an internal data

1539
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:06,210
protection officer at the police and

1540
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:08,010
they try to determine if it was an

1541
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:10,140
official case that they were working on

1542
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:14,310
or if they had private reasons to do so

1543
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:17,970
and this actually works quite well those

1544
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:19,500
areas there are no accesses on these

1545
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:22,590
databases anymore that are not being

1546
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:24,210
logged which is great because in this

1547
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:27,210
particular context this is very

1548
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:31,340
important and very sensible to do so to

1549
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:37,550
the one for Katherine maybe Dan what's

1550
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:45,600
this is a bug very hot that one today

1551
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:48,350
this but vary over time anyway so we're

1552
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:55,020
gonna just pass on to the next question

1553
01:36:48,350 --> 01:37:01,380
yeah no SOC fault is the wrong question

1554
01:36:55,020 --> 01:37:07,050
we had that that's the right one

1555
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:10,320
mr. Kalba I'm the federal Commissioner

1556
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:14,670
for data protection and information

1557
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:20,190
protection my question what is the

1558
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:23,450
maximum fine that a federal agency can

1559
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:23,450
be fined

1560
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:37,910
does anyone remember Mr ba-ba-ba-ba it's

1561
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:42,930
schnell mr. Schwaab you was after all so

1562
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:45,740
in the previous game show again what's

1563
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:45,740
the maximum fine

1564
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:58,050
that the federal agency it can has to

1565
01:37:50,130 --> 01:38:05,400
pay o0 kathleen answers none Reyes says

1566
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:08,750
the same no I've some ideas personnel

1567
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:12,360
fund what it would make more sense to

1568
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:17,040
act against the personally responsible

1569
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:22,440
person to correct answers three to two

1570
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:29,040
for Katrina a bit of background for the

1571
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:32,870
last question Alex hop in George offices

1572
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:39,630
just as I mean agencies just as

1573
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:46,200
corporations can be fined but several

1574
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:48,890
states have decreed that agencies cannot

1575
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:54,170
defined in other nations in Europe

1576
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:54,170
there's different agencies can be fine

1577
01:38:54,500 --> 01:39:01,860
in Germany no way to find a federal

1578
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:05,940
agency okay and now we're back with our

1579
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:07,558
actor okay yeah of course I know I

1580
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:13,509
cannot

1581
01:39:07,559 --> 01:39:19,869
but a little much mr. mayor you have

1582
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:24,579
this website there's a legal problem

1583
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:30,509
second problem the mayor wants to

1584
01:39:24,579 --> 01:39:33,249
evaluate the website statistics how many

1585
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:35,650
men access our website how many women

1586
01:39:33,249 --> 01:39:38,949
you can do all kinds of analytics I

1587
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:40,959
don't quite know so can I use an

1588
01:39:38,949 --> 01:39:45,549
analysis tool on my website asks the

1589
01:39:40,959 --> 01:39:49,539
mayor I think there's a large search

1590
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:51,999
engine there us-based isn't do we need a

1591
01:39:49,539 --> 01:39:54,759
consent for this or can we just run this

1592
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:58,659
please ask your husband who knows all

1593
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:59,380
the technical details what is the legal

1594
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:04,150
status

1595
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:06,489
I just don't know maybe your husband

1596
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:09,429
knows something that will be nice if you

1597
01:40:06,489 --> 01:40:14,249
could ask him right now you are the

1598
01:40:09,429 --> 01:40:17,400
husband of the colleague of this guy

1599
01:40:14,249 --> 01:40:19,929
could someone translate that was

1600
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,459
Southwest German dialect and yes that

1601
01:40:19,929 --> 01:40:27,789
was hard for the interpreters to

1602
01:40:21,459 --> 01:40:29,679
understand - I have it in better audio

1603
01:40:27,789 --> 01:40:31,478
quality but I didn't manage to get it

1604
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:36,659
worked into the video and then cut

1605
01:40:31,479 --> 01:40:39,729
edited okay three questions it's about

1606
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:43,268
whether google analytics can be used and

1607
01:40:39,729 --> 01:40:48,190
in this case can Google Analytics be

1608
01:40:43,269 --> 01:40:50,429
used by a an authority the one that this

1609
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:53,018
guy works for that is the first question

1610
01:40:50,429 --> 01:40:55,479
shall we go through all three yes the

1611
01:40:53,019 --> 01:40:58,320
second question is is an enterprise

1612
01:40:55,479 --> 01:41:03,369
allowed to use Google Analytics and

1613
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:07,799
thirdly even what if it is allowed would

1614
01:41:03,369 --> 01:41:11,289
these organizations have to adhere to

1615
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:12,880
SEO turn first question is a Authority

1616
01:41:11,289 --> 01:41:15,969
and author allowed to use Google index

1617
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:18,429
I'll say no really and also to the

1618
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:20,169
second question enterprises used allow

1619
01:41:18,429 --> 01:41:25,840
to use Google Analytics now again

1620
01:41:20,169 --> 01:41:27,489
all right and third question that's what

1621
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:31,840
they have to adhere to what they have to

1622
01:41:27,489 --> 01:41:35,709
look out for well if they would do you

1623
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:38,829
use this they would have to remove the

1624
01:41:35,709 --> 01:41:40,599
IP address the last two bytes of it at

1625
01:41:38,829 --> 01:41:42,308
least that's what I know from pivec but

1626
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:44,169
it's google antics it's clear that

1627
01:41:42,309 --> 01:41:47,800
Google will not do this that's why I'm

1628
01:41:44,169 --> 01:41:48,809
saying no so to knows and response from

1629
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:52,119
cuddling

1630
01:41:48,809 --> 01:41:56,079
authorities are completely agree no it's

1631
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:58,989
just not on and enterprises yes they can

1632
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:02,159
use Google Analytics but they should

1633
01:41:58,989 --> 01:42:04,839
take care to use these anonymizing

1634
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:08,679
variants where the last two bytes are

1635
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:10,959
made anonymous or pseudo and of course

1636
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:14,469
they have to include this into in their

1637
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:17,199
privacy statement and they have to state

1638
01:42:14,469 --> 01:42:19,329
a legal foundation which they do this

1639
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:21,728
but in my opinion this does not require

1640
01:42:19,329 --> 01:42:25,030
consent it will be legitimate interest

1641
01:42:21,729 --> 01:42:28,749
would be enough good either how would we

1642
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:31,630
score this zero points both cases I'll

1643
01:42:28,749 --> 01:42:33,938
be quick so what is correct authorities

1644
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:36,669
are not allowed you can explain that

1645
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:38,999
better than I can authorities would need

1646
01:42:36,669 --> 01:42:41,499
a legal foundation what would be

1647
01:42:38,999 --> 01:42:45,039
possible would be consent by the

1648
01:42:41,499 --> 01:42:47,429
visitors of a Authority website all

1649
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:49,929
those that are affected by the

1650
01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:52,659
measurement of the website reach but

1651
01:42:49,929 --> 01:42:56,469
consent is excluded because according to

1652
01:42:52,659 --> 01:42:58,509
the legal foundation and a consent will

1653
01:42:56,469 --> 01:43:02,559
not give me any further legitimate

1654
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:05,439
interest 6 111 is not a grounds for

1655
01:43:02,559 --> 01:43:07,209
processing so that's the end of that so

1656
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:10,329
that's what you two said that's correct

1657
01:43:07,209 --> 01:43:12,249
so far our Enterprise is allowed yes

1658
01:43:10,329 --> 01:43:14,860
well it's always possible to obtain

1659
01:43:12,249 --> 01:43:16,599
consent but that would have to be

1660
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:20,049
informed consent would have to be

1661
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:21,909
voluntary that's not often the case of

1662
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:24,849
third question other isn't it first

1663
01:43:21,909 --> 01:43:28,209
allowed yes but and thirdly what has to

1664
01:43:24,849 --> 01:43:30,099
be taken care of and we have a great FAQ

1665
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:32,860
on our website regarding this which you

1666
01:43:30,099 --> 01:43:33,960
will find if you use this large search

1667
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:36,799
engine to lose

1668
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:41,040
look for tracking in websites only six

1669
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:43,050
items just a few pages and that tells

1670
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:45,330
you what companies have to take care of

1671
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:48,750
if they use Google Analytics and its

1672
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:51,480
simplest answer is just don't bother use

1673
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:54,570
something where you don't need all this

1674
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:56,969
stuff such as Matt homo or Mitama is the

1675
01:43:54,570 --> 01:44:00,840
successors of paraffin P week right yes

1676
01:43:56,970 --> 01:44:02,160
exactly so how's the data yourselves the

1677
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,860
statistical data that you want to

1678
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:07,700
collect and don't pass it on to the

1679
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:10,500
third party if you use Google Analytics

1680
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:14,570
in the Google ethics standard settings

1681
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:19,740
you need informed voluntary active

1682
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:23,190
previous and retractable consent by the

1683
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:25,679
users it's not it will not suffice what

1684
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:28,049
you see on many websites if you continue

1685
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:32,700
using this website you will consent to

1686
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:36,330
the use of cookies I have never seen a

1687
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:39,840
cookie banner that will keep those five

1688
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:40,830
conditions first informed team you'd

1689
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:45,240
have to be told

1690
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:47,900
are you do you agree that all the

1691
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:51,090
everything you do on this website is

1692
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:52,950
going to be transformed to transfer to

1693
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:57,470
Google or whoever operates this service

1694
01:44:52,950 --> 01:45:00,120
I've never seen saving like that active

1695
01:44:57,470 --> 01:45:03,930
no tracking is not before you've said

1696
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:06,720
yes voluntary it must be possible to

1697
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:09,420
answer yes and no retractable you have

1698
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:12,000
to be able to rescind your consent to

1699
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:17,010
take back your consent previous

1700
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:19,080
voluntary active what did I forget one

1701
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:21,000
thing I forgot so these are the

1702
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:25,050
obstacles it's all in the FAQ on our

1703
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:27,150
website and that is the position of the

1704
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:29,220
Supervisory authorities so none of you

1705
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:31,049
and answered all three questions

1706
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:33,180
correctly it's still a three to two

1707
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:36,800
school and that gives us a winner for

1708
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:36,800

01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:59,210
overrun drastically but now it's over

1730
01:46:56,630 --> 01:47:01,940
short remark for me I would like to make

1731
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:03,860
we have this wonderful protection

1732
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:06,320
principle of transparency in the GD P R

1733
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:09,860
and you will it wouldn't will not have

1734
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:12,019
escaped you that I know some stuff I

1735
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:13,239
don't know that much about a crypto I do

1736
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:15,320
data protection

1737
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:18,139
professionally as a lawyer yes sorry

1738
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:19,670
it's not excluded but I have tried to be

1739
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:21,170
as fair as possible and passed a few

1740
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:23,750
questions on and I didn't answer

1741
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:27,380
everything correctly so even lawyers can

1742
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:29,150
be wrong so lawyers are always right or

1743
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:31,130
legal people always read that wasn't

1744
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:33,139
true anyway it was the wrong answer so

1745
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:35,120
but the questions were extremely good I

1746
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:38,180
would really like to thank you this was

1747
