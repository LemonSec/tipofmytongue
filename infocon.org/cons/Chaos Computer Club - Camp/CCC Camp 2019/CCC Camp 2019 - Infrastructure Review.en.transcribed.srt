1
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:16,308
welcome to the lecture ten I see that

2
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:18,380
actually some people of you like

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,840
sweating in understand so welcome to the

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,570
infrastructure review as you might

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,669
already know from previous

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,110
infrastructure reviews this talk is a

7
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:29,410
little bit different because we have a

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,180
lot of teams coming up to the stage

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:35,120
there will be some small breaks when

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,489
they need to get their hardware running

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,129
but we hope that we have time for all

12
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:43,730
the teams here the first team that will

13
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:45,710
present a review is the chaos post so

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:59,949
please welcome them to the stage

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:01:02,469
[Applause]

16
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:05,110
and I can see that there is actually

17
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:09,009
some more posts to deliver it's this

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,479
Alaska today not really okay so you

19
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,689
still have a lot of things to do

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,149
afterwards indeed yes break down and

21
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,529
about I would say 5800 cards if we

22
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,479
cannot deliver them here we will take

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,670
them to the next event like Congress or

24
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,950
so and try to little bit it there okay

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,670
so you still need some volunteers which

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,590
will deliver some post it would not hurt

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,780
okay so if you don't have anything to do

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,090
after the infrastructure of you go by

29
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,880
stop there at the post and get some

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,580
cards and deliver them now I will read

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,380
what we received actually years so as

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:47,170
you can see a very nice postcard do you

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,179
all thank you for using our service we

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,399
hope you enjoyed chaos post

35
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:54,090
we delivered three new services during

36
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:58,179
camp for you that's nice to know

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,920
post box certification save you for flak

38
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:03,030
so I don't know what that's on English

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,090
but I hope you know and bi-directional

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,090
chaos so you can send a letter and you

41
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,959
force somebody to give you a response so

42
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,980
that you know that you're actually

43
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,890
delivered it let's go we will be

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,890
available at a more mcd's so that will

45
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,970
be the next event and congress of course

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,078
so stay tuned

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:29,920
oh and about figures about 90 kilogram

48
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:32,799
of postcards were delivered 813 online

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,070
submissions to the camp and over 2,000

50
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:38,920
external postcards wow that's amazing to

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,858
over 42 countries in the world

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,220
that's quite you thank you very much for

53
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:44,220
the post

54
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:58,689
our next team is the network operation

55
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,689
centers so here are the guys

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,509
[Applause]

57
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:11,000
[Music]

58
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,190
I think it's on yeah hello I'm Nick Oh

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,160
doc this is Momo Ventus we are from the

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:20,510
NOC or the internet manufacturer and we

61
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,790
did Network again this time compared to

62
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,250
last camps the goals have been pretty

63
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,650
similar but we've upgraded the fiber

64
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,560
from one gig to each DK to 10 gig

65
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:35,870
I entreat right to avoid the road and

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,880
revenge this time as always we had a

67
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,620
Wi-Fi encrypted and unencrypted 4

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,799
devices which are not capable of it and

69
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,530
we didn't want to filter it our team

70
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,019
consists of 40 people from worldwide

71
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,920
most of them from Europe some from the

72
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,920
UK and the US

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,220
the our buildup started on temps so

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,800
Saturday two weeks ago most of the team

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,900
arrived during build-up so we kept

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,319
increasing the number of people on site

77
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:18,239
and during the event we were also

78
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,238
supported by the great knock help desk

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,400
our design is pretty similar compared to

80
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,710
camp 2015 the campsite is known so we

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,070
could use most of the design back then

82
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,530
it just increased a bit in size and we

83
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,080
also collaborated with the c3 power

84
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,229
teams this time so we had most of the

85
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,500
fiber laid together with the power cords

86
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,640
and attached to them because they also

87
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,540
protected the fiber a bit just by

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,159
because they are so huge we also have

89
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,740
another uplink this time we didn't only

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,620
have the fiber but the we have also an

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,190
RF uplink I'll come to that later we

92
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,710
plant the local set up in CID this time

93
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,690
so we had the auger plants and we made

94
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,630
our own plans for the dart and claws and

95
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,980
the fiber it's a bit tricky to see here

96
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,870
but all the dart and clothes have this

97
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,300
circle around them which shows the rough

98
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,610
well I think it was 40 meter circumvents

99
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,390
of the dart and claw and the thin yellow

100
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,390
lines are the fiber of the decays the

101
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,340
most of the planning was done in CID and

102
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,050
then rendered into OpenStreetMap which

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,989
some of you also used during the camp

104
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,590
and we also use the EMF camp pipeline

105
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:41,010
which has been used in the couple last

106
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,099
EMF camp which produced some PDF plans

107
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,770
for fiber runs so this is the logical

108
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,310
overview of the connection of all dk's

109
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:54,479
we have had a lot more decay than the

110
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,280
last time and this is the logical know

111
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,960
the physical overview of the fiber runs

112
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,969
not the logical one logically it's

113
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:06,780
completely different we increase from 37

114
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:10,020
to 57,000 closed because of the new camp

115
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,630
size and the naming of the dart and

116
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,450
Claus was also changed from cities to

117
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,370
the grid of the augur plan which makes

118
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:22,920
it a lot easier to find them when you

119
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:26,970
first them we have laid out 68 fibers on

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,980
the site increased from 47 and the total

121
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,860
length of all fibers as nine and a half

122
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:35,310
kilometers the strength length so each

123
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,350
single core added together is over 40

124
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,600
kilometers we use 140 couplers for

125
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:44,710
connecting all the fibers together and

126
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,330
we also use new 12-core MPO fiber so

127
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,750
I've got a single connector connecting

128
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,340
to a breakout box which is easy to lay

129
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,990
under train tracks for example so you

130
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,380
don't need to dig a big hole for them

131
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,220
and then you have really tidy setup in

132
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,350
the dart and flow

133
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,790
so in these start and flow values them

134
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,420
you see a picture on the right we

135
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,150
sometimes at only two MPO boxes which

136
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,970
compared to dart and close without MPO

137
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:14,169
was a huge improvement so we had around

138
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:19,120
20 of the MPO cables and of bit more of

139
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:22,590
the non MPO cables external connectivity

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,390
we had a 2 x 10 gig way from a desk on

141
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,599
increased from one time 10 gig last year

142
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,300
and we also found the usage for the

143
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,640
e-collar this time to spool the fiber

144
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,770
from a 4 kilometer school to more

145
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,570
handable of 500 meters to 1 kilometers

146
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,770
up link was done last week on Saturday

147
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:47,409
this time we laid it through the grass

148
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:51,609
as I would say always compared to last

149
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,100
time no big change here the fiber is a

150
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,910
new improved outdoor grade fiber where

151
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,890
the vendor said that it is safe for

152
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:03,580
rodents and we haven't been disappointed

153
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:07,690
this time additionally we've got an RF

154
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,440
uplink we've got a 10 gig main uplink -

155
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,750
grazie

156
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,180
we've got a 10 gig upstream provided by

157
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,180
Deutsche Telekom we also have a 500

158
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,650
megabit backup link to grams e just to

159
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,540
make sure that it still works when

160
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,120
there's a thunderstorm or rain because

161
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,660
the tanana of kilometres is way outside

162
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,150
the spec of the 10 gig link we also have

163
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,880
a 500 megabit link to Berlin to

164
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,728
Alexander term or Alexander Platz which

165
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,580
is 57 kilometers also used as a backup

166
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:41,910
if everything else failed we also use

167
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,910
the during built tier setup and teardown

168
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,410
it's okay dan we also had a local DC

169
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,450
which in the beginning from the promised

170
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,719
I think we ordered over ten kilowatts of

171
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,000
AC power had enough roughly eight eight

172
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,710
kilowatts which we first had to improve

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,750
by putting up some rescue blankets and

174
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,430
you can see actually the dip we produced

175
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,350
by just putting up rescue blankets in

176
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,560
the graph there it's roughly two degrees

177
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,270
just by reflecting sunlight but on day

178
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,000
one we got another air-conditioned and

179
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,069
were able to cool that datacenter down

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,980
quite efficiently you also might have

181
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,530
seen we had a huge transparency

182
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,150
offensive where we try to show everyone

183
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,819
the dot and claw not a doubt until a

184
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,709
datacenter I think you all had a great

185
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,890
look if not take the night we won't tear

186
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:40,460
down until tomorrow so look at all the

187
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,560
fancy backbone our core network in that

188
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,810
DC and as well as in a pop in Berlin

189
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,550
consisted of two to temporary Amex to a

190
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,119
force where we basically did all the

191
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:53,329
VLAN routing we had one arrested he says

192
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,530
seventy five or four as a single core if

193
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,400
that would have failed we would have had

194
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:00,230
a cold standby and on the very right

195
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,319
hand side of the slides you can actually

196
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,600
see the neurological topology of the

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,430
backbone marine managed not to

198
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,440
daisy-chain any data that enclose or

199
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,359
well not too many of them so if there

200
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,300
would be a power outage which happened

201
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,610
quite a lot and in different grits then

202
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,800
no other dot and close would be affected

203
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,470
except the ones change behind him so

204
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,240
yeah also as there was just one coral we

205
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,810
had a loop free design which avoided us

206
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,150
from shitty layer two issues on the

207
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,000
exercise we rolled out ninety-six axis

208
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,829
which is great mix of juniper Nerissa

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,560
big things there to event in front and

210
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,110
proact responds with them to us and also

211
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,680
we were running all a rouble Wi-Fi as we

212
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,930
usually do we also had two eight or 2.11

213
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,599
ax access points for our tests in

214
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,069
workshop one and two so maybe some of

215
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,340
you have noticed that you can connect to

216
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,090
the Wi-Fi or

217
00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:00,780
ix on-site logistics you might have seen

218
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:04,050
our car we had a great Volvo v40 from

219
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,089
2003 which we serviced mainly by first

220
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:10,740
of adding coolant to the engine which it

221
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:14,070
liked and it was a great great help for

222
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,570
us as you see DDOT and closed have D

223
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,880
Wi-Fi access points mounted in their

224
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,990
chimney and on top they have D so called

225
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,560
Alma lights which are from the

226
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,430
unconference

227
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,800
and we had roughly 60 of those Wi-Fi ApS

228
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,569
on a stick which were quite a pain in

229
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,030
the ass to transport so first up we try

230
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,420
to strappin on a car but then we build

231
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,640
our quite nice roof rack which served us

232
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,079
really well and now makes for a very

233
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,080
nice car

234
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,230
also obviously everything we did was

235
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,850
automated so we still are using that box

236
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,319
as our single source of truth and

237
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,480
changed our motto from that box in

238
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,128
shield to net box and Grill and tree I

239
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,660
probably left over a thousand euros at

240
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:04,089
the local butchers so that's what's nice

241
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,829
as well also we have some Enterprise

242
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,569
scripts in place to ensure auto

243
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,959
provisioning off the square of the years

244
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,368
which is monitoring you might have seen

245
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,399
the dashboard already if not go to

246
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:17,410
dashboard cam dot cccd we're using

247
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,449
Prometheus for all our metrics and are

248
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,480
collecting metrics from every other acht

249
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:25,108
which wanted to share them with us also

250
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,519
we did some load testing on our fibers

251
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:29,199
laying them over train tracks it's okay

252
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,149
if the train stops and someone carries

253
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,160
it over the fiber and then puts it back

254
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,319
on so please train operators take a bit

255
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,399
more care next time buddy I'd survived

256
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:42,279
the uplink is fine and wasn't too bad on

257
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:47,169
a more serious note please if you are

258
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:49,389
bringing cable to camp and unroll it

259
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:51,129
through the campsite please make sure to

260
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,319
unroll it properly don't leave big

261
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,239
spools people get stuck in them it's

262
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:57,099
rips out to switch from our DK and

263
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:58,809
that's not really nice so we try to

264
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,769
deploy hints where we found it but

265
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:05,019
please take a bit more care so yeah some

266
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:08,850
numbers for Heiser I guess we had

267
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:12,339
roughly 5800 consecutive Wi-Fi clients

268
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,919
mainly on 5 gigahertz which is nice

269
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,519
we've seen overall roughly 12 and a half

270
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:21,699
thousand devices we actually managed to

271
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,199
saturate our uplink above or depending

272
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,669
on the weather situation about 50

273
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,139
percent which is nice we would love to

274
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,819
see that at Congress if you can make

275
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,189
that happen

276
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:31,868
we had no fiber cuts and our uptime

277
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,689
actually is one hundred percent for the

278
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:38,280
core so that is noise

279
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:43,850
[Applause]

280
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,850
[Music]

281
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,830
one more thing please don't pick dot and

282
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,010
close we know you can those locks are

283
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,320
not secure the adjustment as a barrier

284
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,000
like more of a metaphorical kind -

285
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,460
please don't pick the - in close respect

286
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,270
the infrastructure don't unplug our

287
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,340
stuff

288
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,840
don't leach over the Wi-Fi just use a

289
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,080
cable it makes it worse for everyone

290
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,610
trying to use the Wi-Fi yeah and don't

291
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,120
also mess with other basic

292
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:17,150
infrastructure also shielded cat5e cable

293
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,380
is no good idea in outside deployments

294
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,420
where you have different ground

295
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,780
potentials will trip an RCD so please

296
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,780
don't do that

297
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,469
also as you might have seen all that and

298
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,410
closed have a sign where it says that

299
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:37,420
you should not use them as a toilet and

300
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,829
every sign has its 33 decays were

301
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,469
contaminated during build aboard just

302
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,180
secure them with a zip tie and one was

303
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:52,940
even picked and then contaminated so

304
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:54,560
please please yeah camp as well as

305
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,390
Congress network is not possible without

306
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,469
responses - please give them a warm

307
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,470
round of applause

309
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,170
and last lettuce need last but not least

310
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,209
during Tyrion please don't touch our

311
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,649
network we will unwrap everything else

312
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,300
if you want to help stop by a by the

313
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,180
knock and we will find some work for you

314
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,800
but please do so in a coordinated manner

315
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,120
if you want your cable back please just

316
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,099
roll it up and leave it in front of the

317
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,680
dot and clue we will walk around them

318
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,079
continuously and unplug you and if you

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,638
abroad an SF P R X of P please bring

320
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,138
also a plastic bag otherwise we'll have

321
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,970
to drop it in the ground and s might

322
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:40,579
destroy your optics so that's it

323
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:48,230
questions thank you very much - do not

324
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:50,508
guys our next team on stage will be the

325
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,209
work but if you have a question in

326
00:15:50,509 --> 00:16:00,279
between to the NOC you can ask the

327
00:15:53,209 --> 00:16:00,279
question okay go ahead

328
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:23,540
no questions for the NOC let's see

329
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,129
c3 what is here on stage I think you

330
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,370
already know what we are doing we

331
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:31,519
recorded all these slides and all the

332
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,300
talks and everyone who worked over who

333
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:41,269
walked on the stage there were 82 talks

334
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:44,870
on this conference these resulted in 492

335
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:49,639
new video files uploaded to media dot C

336
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:51,980
CC dot d e we had roughly 10 minutes of

337
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,769
issues accumulated over all talks that

338
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,319
had to be repaired

339
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:00,129
all in all 5 cameras deployed in the

340
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:03,050
stages managed by AC 3 work the last

341
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:06,370
camera was just deployed for the

342
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:10,490
previous talk in here the e3 power one

343
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:13,789
we covered two lectured hence the monkey

344
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,459
stage was managed independently we

345
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:22,059
unfortunately had one small security

346
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:22,059
incident we had to change some passwords

347
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,590
for the first time on a camp I think we

348
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,110
deployed an induction loop for people

349
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,199
with hearing aids they can switch over

350
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:39,520
from microphones to an internal copper

351
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,610
coil and get direct audio without any

352
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,550
echo from from the tent so that they can

353
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,760
understand anything

354
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:51,919
[Applause]

355
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,920
[Music]

356
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,669
we're not just relaxing on all the

357
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,909
software we built and used before in the

358
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:07,669
background there was a lot of

359
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:11,179
development work done for getting worked

360
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:14,090
on mixed already we had a first test set

361
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,309
up in one of the tents in here in THM

362
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,840
and mitre

363
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,760
unfortunately this screenshot we have

364
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,668
there doesn't have the cameras showing

365
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:27,080
but it's a slightly different GUI so we

366
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,549
can mix our angels you might have to

367
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,780
learn something new on the next event

368
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:35,658
and on in the background we fixed a lot

369
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:41,178
of synchronization issues between these

370
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:42,289
sources and audio and so on any

371
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:46,929
questions so far

372
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:51,559
I don't think so now I'm jumping up

373
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:54,140
thank you very much for the no no no we

374
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:57,139
had to do much more than what we what

375
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,570
you saw in the tents in here we

376
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,679
basically planned all the setup in these

377
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:11,590
rooms here we drew some plans on what

378
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:14,270
should be a place where we hired some AV

379
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,379
company to bring us all the stuff we

380
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,850
built up everything together with them

381
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,120
but we also work together with all the

382
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,959
Herald's thank you Harold's Thank You

383
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,959
State's management

384
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,510
although its translation of possible for

385
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,850
the guys and girls and at the Prakriti

386
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,330
some free lingo they could join a and

387
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,709
signal angels who give any microphones

388
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:49,928
converting seems from internet to the

389
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:52,600
question in the lecture tents and many

390
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,940
other teams but without c3 power we

391
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,469
wouldn't have any lights lighting up

392
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,120
this stage we won't have any projectors

393
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,299
our cameras would have to smoke the

394
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,770
batteries every few hours so thank you

395
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,230
very much to power and thank you very

396
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,540
much to knock for providing us with the

397
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,309
upstream to get in streams to all of the

398
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:16,330
thousands of years out there in the

399
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:18,160
world and all of this would not have

400
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,040
been possible if the countless hours of

401
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,140
that work we all angels we went in the

402
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:31,059
halls in the background and everywhere

403
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:34,809
so and one last shot from our office

404
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:36,910
with some I think you can't really see

405
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:38,889
it we also have a Ravana there showing

406
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,010
how many viewers were watching the

407
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:45,150
streams when this photo was taken and

408
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:50,230
down there are some audio monitoring

409
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:52,380
pictures thank you thank you for the

410
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,380
work

411
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,470
the next Samia on stage will be the

412
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,129
little gistic operation center big

413
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:13,029
applause for them already

414
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:13,029
[Applause]

415
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,500
do you see my slides I don't see them

416
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:46,550
this should be better it should be

417
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:47,870
louder I guess that's the truth there

418
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:54,050
were more people here in the room come

419
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:55,669
on do it a little bit louder it's

420
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:02,750
getting better but you can even do it

421
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:04,960
better and now different shifts that's

422
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,960
good

423
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,970
that's mean to put in even the different

424
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:26,610
melody also thanks to the AV angel who's

425
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:30,559
fixing my laptop right now because I

426
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,559
can't use expander at all

427
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,930
so there's the next angel coming up on

428
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,710
the stage seems to be a little bit

429
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:50,790
bigger problem

430
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:52,530
oh no just taking stuff okay that

431
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,120
doesn't seem to be a usual problem like

432
00:22:52,530 --> 00:23:01,100
putting more angels to it and it will

433
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:01,100
work should should be better way

434
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,029
[Music]

435
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,189
yet goes to logistics operation center

436
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:42,290
I got about 1.5 seconds delay here so

437
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:45,050
they're with me please now we have it

438
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,330
yeah weird luck as you can see we do

439
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,210
logistics not design and we definitely

440
00:23:47,330 --> 00:24:02,840
don't do any video technic technical

441
00:23:50,210 --> 00:24:05,090
stuff so let's get started you can see

442
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,310
how AV angels are always around and

443
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,169
always have very helpful and we

444
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:12,020
definitely don't do stuff with computers

445
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,400
or microphones so and cam started to us

446
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,090
actually with the early planning

447
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,840
November last year actually build up

448
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,990
started on August cert with packing oil

449
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,629
stuff in one of our suite for warehouses

450
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,180
in Berlin you see pictures of it there

451
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:34,250
that's where most of the stuff is stored

452
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:36,890
between the congresses and camp on day

453
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:41,060
15 the first people of us arrived here

454
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:44,450
at an empty warehouse tent with our

455
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:51,200
first build of stuff and well we started

456
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:55,490
to unload lots of 40 ton trucks all in

457
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,040
all we had 40 transports with truck 7.5

458
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:01,190
ton trucks and 40 ton trucks and that's

459
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,560
only built up and only transports we

460
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,290
organized this doesn't include transport

461
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,050
by D hell and stuff like this and it

462
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,330
doesn't include teardown we had a total

463
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,129
of two our waiting time in phone queues

464
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,290
for truck replacement because we broke

465
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,590
one truck and it's still not replaced

466
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:24,110
and we delivered a total of two pillars

467
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:26,480
of liquor for the bars we delivered 120

468
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,850
cubic meters of couches most of which

469
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,600
were from last Congress and will be used

470
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,600
on the next Congress

471
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,590
some people don't take as much off as a

472
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:44,570
vacation for example I did so when it

473
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,549
comes to purchasing which since last

474
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,100
Congress is a part of the logistics I

475
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:53,320
did that from Berlin so we had actually

476
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:57,769
a remote office in Berlin from which we

477
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:00,559
also during the you wind got some four

478
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:05,899
pellets of toilet paper because we ran

479
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:08,178
out we use about one pellet per day we

480
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:13,879
also had to get about 200 liters of soap

481
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:21,139
because we used more than we thought yes

482
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:24,230
thank you thank you for washing your

483
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:27,049
hands during the event we also bought

484
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,600
two more pallets of paper towels than we

485
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:32,629
thought we needed we had a total of six

486
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,580
pallets of toilet paper I hope we would

487
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:36,980
don't have to buy any more for Vietnam I

488
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,990
really hope so because we need to drive

489
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:42,320
to the Metro in Berlin for this time for

490
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:46,669
that and that's two hours one way we

491
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:49,129
used around 250 liters of soap and due

492
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:51,679
to some defective toilet brushes or some

493
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:54,730
just vanished old brushes we had to buy

494
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,009
around 50 of them

495
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:00,580
we also handled lots of dangerous goods

496
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:04,429
for example for cleaning toilets and

497
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:09,289
washing machines and dishwashers this is

498
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:12,009
around half of what we dealt with and we

499
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:16,549
have some fun facts about purchasing too

500
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:18,970
as of now metro doesn't have any lime in

501
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,970
Germany

502
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,530
you may also have noticed that we had

503
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,590
three different kinds of toilet paper

504
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,860
during Diamond we started with one ply

505
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,689
very dark toilet paper but we couldn't

506
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:46,428
do this to ourselves and to none of you

507
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:48,890
so we got some free ply but at some

508
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,000
point we ran out of three ply so we went

509
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,830
to the meadow and through this line

510
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,390
again and bought some more free ply

511
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,980
toilet paper so I went there and told

512
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,900
them yeah I need four pellets of toilet

513
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,050
paper and they looked at me and said

514
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,030
well we don't have four pallets of free

515
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,350
ply toilet paper so we took three or

516
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,178
three ply and one or four ply toilet

517
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:11,030
paper so if you find really nice toilet

518
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:14,090
paper please leave it so right now they

519
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:16,550
only have one ply the Metro Iranian book

520
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,399
where we have been for most of the fresh

521
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:21,050
fruit delivery also lime is out of paper

522
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,559
towels because we needed new paper

523
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:27,559
towels as we had to drive so many

524
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,780
kilometres to Berlin and to Ohanyan book

525
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,480
and the two people who were doing the

526
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,240
purchasing this includes me spend around

527
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,570
50 hours sitting around in cars we hope

528
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,960
this will be less next camp we bought

529
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,960
around

530
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,110
we bought around 25 kilometres of

531
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,580
barrier tape and I looked it up 30

532
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:55,289
minutes before this talk we have around

533
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:57,539
500 metres left we had to buy 10

534
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:59,129
replacement tires for the hand cards I

535
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:01,379
don't know what you people are doing to

536
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,789
them and and we have two broken hand

537
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,330
cards right now without replacement

538
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:08,490
errors and if you've seen some beer some

539
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,320
beanbags we actually also bought three

540
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,679
cubic meters of filling because they

541
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,210
were pretty empty after last Congress so

542
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,700
if there's any questions about what else

543
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,179
we purchased just come to us after this

544
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,120
talk yeah is the most annoying object to

545
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,960
transport by far was this thing we call

546
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,049
it dirty

547
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,820
it's from Pomona and sadly they do some

548
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:32,429
really cool stuff with it so we can't

549
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,350
just throw it away but it's a pain zest

550
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:36,539
to transport because it doesn't fit on a

551
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,100
forklift and it's bouncy and it doesn't

552
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:44,010
really fit on our truck and it's totally

553
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:45,928
 up and we also did some sort of

554
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:54,090
post office and received a total of

555
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:56,760
around 1,000 packages most this this so

556
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,010
hands up who use the service this does

557
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,679
not include packages that we ordered

558
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:03,960
ourselves for the lock or for any teams

559
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,130
or for the purchasing it's just you and

560
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:12,240
certainly most of them were from Amazon

561
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:16,350
yes so we transported the same stuff at

562
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,360
least three times from Berlin to camp we

563
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,730
told DPD at least two times to actually

564
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,309
deliver the packages to our tent and not

565
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,799
drop them on during some grassland or

566
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,549
tell us we are not we weren't available

567
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,870
to collect and when we are 24 hours open

568
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:35,490
and we didn't take enough pictures as

569
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:38,279
you see on all the text slides yeah we

570
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,960
also I just received this news earlier

571
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,070
so I couldn't put it in the slides

572
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,169
anymore

573
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,059
we're using we're moving a lot of stuff

574
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:48,630
and you're moving a lot of stuff too so

575
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:51,330
if you are driving a vehicle that's neat

576
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:53,220
that needs diesel fuel don't stop at any

577
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,939
fuel stations in Grande Z or Tillamook

578
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,940
they don't have any

579
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,840
we also noticed you tested some of the

580
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:11,629
business in front of the cash desk and

581
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,149
well they don't is they are not camper

582
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:19,549
proof so if you drive a camper over this

583
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:23,030
bridge well you get a CSV sinkhole and

584
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:24,770
we also got a guest storage we didn't

585
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,840
know about this until a day before we

586
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,929
had to build it so if you plan to bring

587
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,360
a lot of dangerous goods like 70 bottles

588
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,000
of gas to the camp next time please tell

589
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,399
us beforehand and before it doesn't mean

590
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,230
a week it means two or three months

591
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,990
please at least yeah but we are not done

592
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,960
yet we are staying here until 1st of

593
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,179
September and we have to pack around 130

594
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,150
pellets we have to move a lot of stuff

595
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:55,010
to Leipzig in Berlin and have an unknown

596
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,650
amount of other transports to organize

597
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,809

sustainability and since we yellow

610
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:47,000
[Applause]

611
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,070
so now again the question who used the

612
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,810
service from the lock to get a parcel

613
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:54,439
delivered here I couldn't see all the

614
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,940
hands up so I come on the roof thousand

615
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,920
packages so there must be more people

616
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:05,230
here in the room or did you all get like

617
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:05,230
20 puzzles but amazing service

618
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:24,189
hi so this is a joint presentation of CS

619
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,710
we help yellow the team that managed

620
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,740
hygiene and new teams is a

621
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:35,200
sustainability I start with some

622
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:39,940
information from c3 cab so during camp

623
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:44,970
we used approximately 1300 55 cubic

624
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:47,590
meters of water like until this day and

625
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:53,610
calculated to the number of people that

626
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:57,970
is 271 liters per person seems legit

627
00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:03,250
c3 gap ran washing machines we did 50

628
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:05,620
laundry loads during camp and probably

629
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,930
you know the Shippuden as a service

630
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:15,429
dishwashing as a service service

631
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:15,429
[Applause]

632
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,190
we had three of them on-site at two

633
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:25,980
locations they were on the high load

634
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:28,649
permanently used but the waiting time

635
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,210
was mostly below 20 minutes it was the

636
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,520
first time that we did this year so

637
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:36,510
sorry if it was not as smooth as it

638
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,889
could be in total we had 80 angels that

639
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:47,790
helped us with the dishwashing

640
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:50,679
[Applause]

641
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:52,870
we also had water dispensers at two

642
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,418
locations at heaven it was at use

643
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:58,120
approximately half of the time at the

644
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:00,330
lake it was basically used all the time

645
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,770
from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.

646
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,470
these machines can do 3 liters per

647
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:09,070
minute for the sparkling water tab we

648
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:12,100
used 50 kilograms of co2 that makes

649
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:14,260
approximately 5000 litres of sparkling

650
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,080
water we don't have data for the non

651
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:19,870
sparkling water but we guess it's at

652
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:24,509
least the same amount so you did good

653
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,509
you drank water but drink even more

654
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:33,300
we had 190 people that actually did this

655
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,300
bureaucratic hygiene diploma

656
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:44,390
and many many things too easy from

657
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:51,080
Kidspace who did the briefings on site

658
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:55,250
and like stamping and signing so this

659
00:35:51,080 --> 00:36:01,970
concludes with the if you have questions

660
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:03,680
maybe now it's the time yeah please get

661
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,959
a microphone for the question there are

662
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:12,500
two angels in the hall which have

663
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:14,300
microphones I know that the water

664
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,100
dispensers were put in to help save

665
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,290
plastic so that we don't have as many

666
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,420
plastic water bottles do you have any

667
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,400
statistics on how many plastic water

668
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:26,930
bottles we had this year versus the last

669
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:32,120
cam no we don't have data on that but we

670
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:37,000
have plans to improve the water bottle

671
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,000
situation for Congress Thanks

672
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:49,578
okay then I move on to CCC

673
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:54,230
sustainability so as you know power is

674
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:58,369
provided by fossil fuel generators we

675
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:00,380
used approximately 4.5 liters of well

676
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:04,490
it's not yeah diesel whatever like

677
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:08,749
heating oil per person like Inc

678
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:10,069
including the whole time until now for

679
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:15,470
the climate impact that's approximately

680
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:17,690
13 kilograms of co2 per person so this

681
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,999
means like it's approximately the same

682
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:25,609
as when you drive 100 kilometers with a

683
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:28,910
car so this doesn't sound so bad but of

684
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:31,038
course it would be nice to have other

685
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:34,460
solutions in the future because we

686
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:38,170
cannot afford to to burn fossil fuel

687
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,170
anymore so

688
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:51,390
so we ran around and got some pictures

689
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,710
of solar panels and solar cells at the

690
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,170
campsites and there were actually a lot

691
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,450
of them so this is very good we want to

692
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,320
see more of that next time bring your

693
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,319
solar cells

694
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:21,090
now I hand over to okay so we're we are

695
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:23,970
we know about that we need to change

696
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,450
something and how we provide power to

697
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:29,430
all of us so we are all using power for

698
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,040
all kinds of different things heating

699
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:36,990
cooling lights and charging devices are

700
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,390
only four of the major ones so we put up

701
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,819
a rock group or which we call as a

702
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:44,790
working title event grid to actually

703
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,030
pull up a completely new full stack

704
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:52,440
green DC power network for future camps

705
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:56,940
and outer events international so it's

706
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:00,480
not only CCC camps but also other other

707
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,660
outer events like sha for example and

708
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,119
and we were lucky to build on the

709
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,359
knowledge of the Shah

710
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,609
which did already a test run so we are

711
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,549
now focusing on these items which you

712
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:18,240
see on the slide so we try to build up a

713
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:22,290
smaller power grid DC power grid to

714
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,750
enable shift to green power which is for

715
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,930
the consumer devices and a backbone

716
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:32,280
which has around 300 to 400 volts DC

717
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:36,180
power we want to also provide some more

718
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,690
insights on how we use power so we would

719
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:43,169
like to visualize even better how much

720
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:46,890
power we use so to make you guys all a

721
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,960
little bit more aware of how much power

722
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:52,560
we are using for example what your

723
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,790
village uses right now so new power

724
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,950
meters would be a nice thing or

725
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:02,279
extending on those we have on the on the

726
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:05,640
generators right now and we would like

727
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,670
to also provide completely new power

728
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,150
meter as as a kid as a do-it-yourself

729
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:16,650
kit so that you can have a power meter

730
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:18,480
which is also enabled to do some 24/7

731
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:22,310
logging on your power usage

732
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:26,010
and which you could also use at home

733
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,960
yeah we provided or we set up a quick

734
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:32,570
questionnaire for you for all of you

735
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:36,660
visiting the camp yeah this is this is

736
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:39,420
the survey URL you can go to this URL

737
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:44,520
and on the slide before you may have

738
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,380
seen that we have a wiki so at this

739
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,869
point

740
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,500
huge thanks to the Netherlands and to

741
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:55,200
the shower which are providing this wiki

742
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,570
and you can look up all the stuff we

743
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,549
were working on there in the wiki and we

744
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:04,680
will keep you updated on that Vicki so

745
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:07,320
take the survey this would be great so

746
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,020
thank you very much to see three yellow

747
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,880
and see three sustainability we have one

748
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,790
more team to go which needs to fit into

749
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,890
the next five minutes it's so big one

750
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:23,579
other side so yeah we've got you may

751
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:27,150
wonder why I have this thing you we were

752
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:30,060
just like to educate on kind of help you

753
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:32,760
can do we put up these signs today it

754
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:37,880
contains a QR code which tells you how

755
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,880
to how to do a do-it-yourself dust mask

756
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:45,060
we had electronic waste recycling

757
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:48,480
station we organize organic waste 15

758
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,460
bins please don't put backs in there we

759
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,000
started serving to reduce meat

760
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,089
consumption we ask the bars to ask

761
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:03,980
people if they want straws and yeah go

762
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:03,980
strike all right thank you very much

763
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:15,280
and the last and final teamriche comes

764
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,549
up to the stage today is our awesome

765
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,170
heaven so please say you trolled of

766
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:22,170
applause for to heaven

767
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:35,910
so I had no time to bring slides because

768
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:37,920
all the heaven is working very hard to

769
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,930
get things done as we did all the time

770
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,239
but we didn't do it alone

771
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,249
you saw all these themes who were doing

772
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,170
something here all of these are angels

773
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:49,379
all of these are more as part of our

774
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:52,079
team as we are coordinating the angels

775
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,029
of the other angel group and not

776
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,839
everybody is part of such a team so we

777
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:59,759
had quite additional stuff to do and are

778
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,890
still trying to do something at the

779
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:05,249
moment when I wrote down the numbers

780
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,950
there were 66 people working 66 angels

781
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:10,890
working but we were missing a lot of

782
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:13,169
people this is just those who were in in

783
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,788
the shift tracks so those we are

784
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,539
tracking there are a lot of more people

785
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:24,630
working on the teams and everywhere so

786
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:27,299
we still have about 170 I was open shift

787
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,979
for the next three hours so all my

788
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:30,660
shifts have a need people which are

789
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:32,910
coordinated through the system and

790
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:37,109
there's a lot of more stuff to do that

791
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:38,700
we don't have shifts for and they are

792
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:44,279
also a lot of night shifts that we need

793
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:48,598
to do but over the whole camp since or

794
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:52,140
for the on-site stuff we trekked 20,000

795
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,630
hours this is about two years two and a

796
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,859
quarter years which was worked by

797
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:02,719
volunteers just here on the site which I

798
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,719
believe is a very great thing

799
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:19,100
this work was done by 1836 people who

800
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,710
are marked as arrived angels we don't

801
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,319
check who actually did work but a lot of

802
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,260
them really worked hard to get all this

803
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,960
camp done and yesterday we introduced

804
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,660
the angel awareness day I hope everybody

805
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,850
hacked or thanked at least two angels

806
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,440
and we ask you to do so again if you

807
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,350
didn't do it yesterday please Edward

808
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:48,710
twice today

809
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:51,808
[Applause]

810
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,819
yeah thank you all the angels that are

811
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:55,710
working here at the place we have a lot

812
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:57,660
of people in the stand working so thank

813
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:01,890
you here as well and a lot of people

814
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:04,499
outside so if you can do two hours in

815
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:06,319
work today or tomorrow that would be

816
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:08,819
cool even if you're not one of the

817
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,308
angels in the system we really need

818
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:13,890
people for traffic for teardown Locke
