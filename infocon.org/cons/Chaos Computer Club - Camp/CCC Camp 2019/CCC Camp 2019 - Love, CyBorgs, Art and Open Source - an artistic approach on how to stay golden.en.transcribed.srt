6
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,780
you came to see my talk today I think

7
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:37,849
it's quite a special topic because I'm

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,489
not a programmer I'm not talking about

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,600
much technology I'm more talking about

10
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:47,328
art about a really special way to see

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,300
the world and yeah maybe even

12
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:55,520
celebrating that that way as a kind of

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:57,559
weapon as a kind of language yeah first

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,180
I would like to introduce myself my name

15
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:06,350
is Leo I work as artist under the name

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,229
Lu JP Musk Luke I'm an art student at

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,559
the Art Academy in Munich Academy of

18
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:17,179
Fine Arts Munich and the cast for

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:21,380
digital and time-based medium I are

20
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:25,549
written from the from the politically

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:29,539
left left-wing direction which let me

22
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,829
also - body modification I wear an a/c

23
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:34,789
chip inside of my hand

24
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:37,939
and I'm highly interested in all that

25
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:40,130
field because I see it as a kind of

26
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:43,038
merging between human and machine very

27
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:47,689
soon I guess you guys can imagine that

28
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:52,340
in your super open to the topic and yeah

29
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:55,788
let's just jump through that thing well

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,439
I have a rough outline introduction I'm

31
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:02,299
gonna tell you a little bit about my art

32
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:05,119
my personal work and my intention then I

33
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:06,950
would like to try to talk about the

34
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,979
definition of art which is not really

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,209
easy I would like to show you some

36
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:17,209
artists the talk right after me contains

37
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:19,880
some I'm a big fan of as well I would

38
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,160
like to talk about my personal autism

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:31,299
theories

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:46,990
I do feel noise often hello off you

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:48,460
better vise to load alright so yeah I

42
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,710
would like to tell you more about my

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,740
personal autism theories that's how I

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,780
call it I would like to suggest some

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,450
solutions to the actual social problems

46
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,570
that I see as an artist and as a human

47
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,260
basically and then I would like to have

48
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,900
a discussion with you if you guys are in

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,299
I would like to ask you to interrupt me

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,340
anytime you can just raise your hand if

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,610
you want to tell me something if you

52
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:20,860
want to add any facts because I'm not

53
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:23,980
super fact orientated I'm more mindful

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,260
and into consciousness that look a

55
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,649
little bit spiritual but in a cyborg way

56
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,920
as I say so you can interrupt me anytime

57
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,510
and I also want to point out that the

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,600
movie I'm gonna show you is maybe

59
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,630
nothing for kids so if there's any kids

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,500
or people that are lightheaded I don't

61
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,980
want you to faint

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,550
so please maybe leave the room now if

63
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,260
you don't want to see that movie yeah I

64
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:55,120
think I'm gonna start with the movie

65
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:59,709
that's a spontaneous it you know what I

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,290
mean decision right so we have some

67
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:04,530
music and you see what I do maybe that's

68
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,530
easier

69
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,470

[Music]

78
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:25,849
so I'm gonna stop here I think you you

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,470
saw what I wanted to use for my

80
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:32,060
introduction

81
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:38,289
I'm already 34 years old I'm a carpenter

82
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,289
I'm a CPR like emergency worker and

83
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:47,990
tattoo artist and I realized that a lot

84
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:52,729
of people judge me for this work

85
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,919
especially I I use it as my example

86
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,860
because I can explain my kind of art

87
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,799
past in this piece the reason I did that

88
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:06,020
was actually to try to perform at time

89
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,199
jump in an artistic ideology so I made

90
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,150
it to two and three weeks later I

91
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,940
decided to remove that too I put it in

92
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:19,340
formaldehyde and I put it into an art

93
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:23,630
gallery this actually tells a lot to me

94
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:27,349
I got judged for that work it's nothing

95
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,930
about any psychiatric issues I have I

96
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:32,360
didn't enjoy it actually was a real hard

97
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,180
thing to do for me but to me was really

98
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,370
important because as an artist you have

99
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,598
a lot of pressure you have to be present

100
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:44,120
if you guys know Marina Abramovic

101
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:49,459
she started stuff like that in the 60s

102
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:54,020
already and yeah I think she was in a

103
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:56,989
similar Road like me if you see that a

104
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,270
piece of my body physically is exhibited

105
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,750
in a gallery that means the artist

106
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,620
artist is present even if he or she is

107
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,620
not present

108
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:24,680
so the piece of myself it will not only

109
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,430
be present in that moment I exhibited it

110
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,709
but it also will be in the future that

111
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:36,050
means that I perform a time jump with my

112
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:38,479
DNA ideology I know it's not proper

113
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,729
because I think the piece of skin the

114
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,160
tattoo will not last very long my DNA

115
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,540
might be killed by the formaldehyde but

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,420
in theory it shows that I well part of

117
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,980
me which is only a little square piece

118
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,599
is already existing in the future

119
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,130
maybe in some art collection maybe not

120
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,170
maybe it's going to land in the trash I

121
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,870
don't know but the message is that it's

122
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,540
important to understand that even a

123
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,930
pixel three times three centimeter of

124
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:14,390
the body of you of a picture of cells of

125
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:17,599
you represent all of you because if you

126
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,990
if you heard about cell memory you know

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,170
that your body is defined out of all the

128
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,980
mass of yourselves right so we are

129
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:31,250
mainly water and we define ourselves

130
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,820
through our minds sometimes some people

131
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,270
do that even through their bodies but to

132
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,630
me

133
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:41,899
it's like a never-ending chain my skin

134
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:46,360
is renewing every night every day I lose

135
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:49,790
a part of myself every breath I take is

136
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,070
exchanged this process is really

137
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,920
important to me that's also why I show

138
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,339
all those all those fast pictures

139
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,380
because we're living in a world that

140
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:05,709
adjusts processes there's no product

141
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:08,270
anymore that are to be important to me I

142
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:12,310
don't know if any one of you has read

143
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:14,779
the cyborg manifesto but on a hard way I

144
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,899
really I really would like to suggest it

145
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,540
to you it's really feministic that's

146
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,010
what people say I have my own opinion

147
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,339
about it but I'm not here to discuss

148
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,350
that I just would like to recommend you

149
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,460
to read it and build your own opinion

150
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,350
about it as well as

151
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,110
the German book he goes I'm alone

152
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,850
critical bye-bye pressed he's kind of

153
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:41,850
like a pop philosophy guy I like him he

154
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,980
has a good opinion but as always please

155
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:54,570
build up your own opinion and check it

156
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:59,339
out this one has a fancy effect by Apple

157
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:02,610
I like it this one is another work I did

158
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:06,930
as you can see my main topic is the

159
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:11,520
overwhelming in this today's world so I

160
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:15,839
built this kind of like ball out of

161
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:19,260
monitors it's 25 monitors 26 raspberry

162
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,750
PI's and zeros as well and it's bound on

163
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,540
there with shabari ropes

164
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,580
those are Japanese ropes because I think

165
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:31,610
in times where we have to question ai

166
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:36,120
and humanity collective intelligence

167
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:39,540
cloud uploads you imagine what I what I

168
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,400
mean I think the most important question

169
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:48,209
is what's gonna happen about Authority I

170
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:52,260
mean if I lose my leg and my leg is

171
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:55,219
going to reproduce still I'm 75 percent

172
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,310
roughly of myself if I see myself as a

173
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:02,540
bunch of cells but the rest of it it's

174
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:07,739
gonna be metal maybe or some high

175
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:11,400
prosthetic device how much of me is

176
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,880
gonna be so me since I since I believe

177
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,850
in a cell memory I think the question is

178
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,650
which leg is gonna win I mean if the

179
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,720
right one is not real the left one is

180
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:25,170
real and me and my brain is steering

181
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,730
both of them what if the right leg

182
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,370
decides to go another way suddenly

183
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,820
because it's maybe metal and not part of

184
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,490
me or is my body going to adapt it like

185
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:38,370
for example I think the the chip I have

186
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,740
it's kind of like collaborating in a

187
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,750
weird way with my body because I'm

188
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,090
weather sensitive I

189
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,390
but a lot of you know that from

190
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:50,480
themselves if I have a scar scar tissue

191
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,710
whatever and it's gonna start to rain

192
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,970
it's gonna get itchy it's gonna feel

193
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,480
funny stuff like that

194
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,790
the same happens to me with the tissue

195
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,430
around my microchip

196
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:05,550
once I get close to magnets I talked to

197
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,680
many people and they told me they they

198
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,780
believe that could be possible because

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,469
there is metal inside right that's

200
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,730
logical

201
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,130
so if I imagine I had a whole leg or

202
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,670
maybe even more a whole torso whatever

203
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,730
in the very faraway future I wouldn't

204
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,099
really know what would happen in

205
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,240
questions of authority how much of

206
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,120
myself is gonna have control over the

207
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,840
rest and if I lose half of my brain it's

208
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,590
going to reproduce in a computer what

209
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:47,160
decisions are going to be made different

210
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:49,760
yeah the work over here is exactly

211
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,010
discussing that through some symbolism

212
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,319
because you can see those ropes they use

213
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:59,939
in bondage you maybe know that from the

214
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,370
BDSM and fetish area and I wanted to

215
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,420
show that those videos all around the

216
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:10,800
bar which I have machines like war

217
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:15,240
machines or machines in in the building

218
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:19,020
in the making by companies I don't have

219
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:24,600
to mention I chose a lot of holographic

220
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:28,650
stuff it shows technology about 70% and

221
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,250
the rest of it is is nature I mean I put

222
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,720
some videos of bees and stuff and I

223
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,630
think it's really hard to describe art

224
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,240
you should step inside to understand but

225
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,220
I think the the overwhelming of the

226
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,310
actual world is a big problem it's gonna

227
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,080
be a big problem and I think you can

228
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,130
also see the effects already on the kids

229
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,440
I have a son and I remember when he was

230
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,939
five years old I showed him a bunch of

231
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,790
photographs you know like physical

232
00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,870
photographs and what he did was

233
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,980
move and the pictures flew away because

234
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,570
he didn't understand it's not the

235
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,260
tablets and at that point I tried or I

236
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:13,740
started to understand that

237
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:16,080
haptically sensations and all that it's

238
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,940
gonna start to change it's like the body

239
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,450
hair changes because we're not in the

240
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,640
blizzard and cold anymore it's a lot of

241
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,960
genetic and evolutionary stuff going on

242
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,990
and I think as an artist my my tool to

243
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,830
try to give a sense of what's going to

244
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,960
happen in the future to people is make

245
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:43,200
exhibitions just talk to them through

246
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:46,950
the language of art yeah so what is art

247
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,170
especially conceptual art I don't think

248
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,870
you don't know what conceptual art is

249
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,069
but I felt the need to show this

250
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,110
definition of the Internet it says an

251
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,270
art form in which the artists intent is

252
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:07,589
to convey a concept rather than to

253
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:11,730
create an art object sorry it's just so

254
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:15,389
hard well I think that's a really easy

255
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:19,470
definition it's made easy but it's not

256
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:23,220
that easy because if you see this whole

257
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,589
camp as a sculpture as I do a social

258
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,340
sculpture you might be reminded and

259
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:32,220
people like like boys but actually Skype

260
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,780
drills like this you cannot hang over

261
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,120
your couch you cannot sell them for

262
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,770
millions but they exist and they are the

263
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,000
really really important pieces of art

264
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,680
that's how I see it it's relative it's

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,400
all relative of course I would like to

266
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,680
sell some crappy shit that somebody can

267
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,980
put over the couch and get millions for

268
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:57,390
it so I can find your artsy stuff and

269
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:01,830
change the world in a naive way I do as

270
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:07,920
an artist but yeah I mean I think this

271
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:10,020
definition is so broad and so wide that

272
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,700
there's a lot of space for other

273
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:17,520
disciplines as well so I don't know if

274
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,820
you guys know stell arc he's a really

275
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,240
cool artist I'm in touch with him

276
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:28,500
actually he used to do a lot of things

277
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,920
he had this ear in his arm he's getting

278
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,210
hooked he's getting body suspensions

279
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,250
he's yeah a great guy in starting the

280
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,770
whole scene and actually he got a body

281
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,760
suspension and the art academy of Munich

282
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,230
a long time ago also boys is a very

283
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,410
important person to me because

284
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,140
especially not because he is a cool guy

285
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:55,080
and he's super crazy and I admire him

286
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,210
but also he was the one starting off

287
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,750
with all that social sculpture thing I

288
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,640
did several social sculptures but it's

289
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,250
always hard to sell stuff like that so

290
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,390
it's more like people smile at you like

291
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:11,910
oh nice she's trying to do something but

292
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:17,910
as I said to me that's the essential

293
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:22,620
part of art of course I guess you know

294
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:25,500
moon rebus and Neil Harbison cool people

295
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,479
they are thinking about they founded the

296
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,430
cyborg foundation I think that tuck is

297
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,560
right after this so I'm really looking

298
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,590
forward maybe you should listen at that

299
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,909
one too if you hear

300
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,330
Nina that's the guy with the antenna in

301
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:44,880
his head who can basically hear colors

302
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:47,639
if I understood it right I think it's

303
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,770
really really good that those guys start

304
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:57,060
to raise awareness for all the

305
00:19:51,770 --> 00:20:00,330
personification thing of cyborgs I mean

306
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,720
if you have a body part that is not you

307
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,490
but it's practically inside of you or

308
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,380
implemented in some way that still means

309
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,410
it's a part of you so it should get

310
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,700
riots as well but that's a very long

311
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:18,210
discussion so I reduce that to to my

312
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,720
power well here's some nice pictures of

313
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,720
those guys

314
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:28,570
on the bottom right stellar with one of

315
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,980
his a super cool fancy devices he did

316
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,649
there's many videos if you want to

317
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,650
research him I promise you found a lot

318
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,110
well now here's my autism theories as an

319
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:51,060
artist I I like to play in my mind

320
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:54,159
conceptual art is like how do I say that

321
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,919
it's like a big playground for me to go

322
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,200
all crazy I can change my personality is

323
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,710
kind of like David Bowie did I can play

324
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,910
around I can imagine things I can talk

325
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:10,200
about Schrodinger's cat stuff like that

326
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:15,210
so in my opinion autism especially

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:21,250
Asperger's and you know that Simon

328
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:26,560
what's-his-name : thinking about being

329
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:30,370
autistic to me represents a strong sense

330
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,310
of evolution I researched a lot and it's

331
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,530
hard to put that in words but I realized

332
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:42,340
there's a lot of parallels and autistic

333
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:46,120
people and evolution in - it's a slow

334
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:50,830
evolution that's pointing into the

335
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:54,429
direction that is harder for the brain

336
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:59,040
to process some things and at the same

337
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:02,770
time do some other but since we are in a

338
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:06,820
Anthropocene time age it's going to

339
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:09,010
happen anyway so of course if we use

340
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:14,710
computers a lot of course our kids start

341
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:18,730
to import import the optical stuff but

342
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,620
not only that I even think that all

343
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,310
those kids from engineers and IT

344
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:27,040
managers that are autistic or on the

345
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,780
spectrum as you would say it they are

346
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,920
basically the future because they are

347
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:35,539
ever looting into a world where it's

348
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:43,820
easier to focus on yourself and

349
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:47,509
at social skills if you choose to so I

350
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:52,309
think the most important thing is to

351
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:54,289
talk about solutions so the most

352
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,479
important point I have here on my little

353
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:59,149
sheet is being interdisciplinary I

354
00:22:56,479 --> 00:23:02,119
realized a lot of people just separate

355
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:04,820
they isolate the physicist hang out with

356
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:08,330
the physicists the artists do the art

357
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,499
stuff the hackers - the hack stuff but

358
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:15,649
it's much more important to generate a

359
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:17,659
fusion in the same name vessel you can

360
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:19,908
see that and you can see here as well

361
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:23,989
how good it works but I think we should

362
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:26,629
spread that more in the world in general

363
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:29,539
then to me it's really important to

364
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:33,428
sharpen social skills that's easy to say

365
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:36,529
but it's not that easy actually we

366
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:38,179
started to move away from people we

367
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,899
don't respect each other that much

368
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:40,970
anymore

369
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:45,349
that's what I can see on the internet

370
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:49,119
sometimes we try to anonymize ourselves

371
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:49,119
and I don't think that's a good thing

372
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:55,428
what is worries actually is to steal

373
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,289
data from people of course but if we

374
00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:00,889
have the the power to change that now we

375
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:03,830
should do that well communication is

376
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:06,649
essential that's true if you are not

377
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:11,619
able to communicate no matter if your

378
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:14,748
language is art or design or Python

379
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:16,629
you're not able to do anything right so

380
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:19,789
you should try to listen to other people

381
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:22,209
get back to the communication skills

382
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:25,399
because they are super essential and

383
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:29,359
then art can be a weapon or a language

384
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:32,059
or switch so as I said boys is super

385
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:36,049
right and he also said that everybody is

386
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:38,149
an artist so if you could even if you go

387
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,460
to the toilet you can see everything you

388
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:45,379
do as art if you do it a positive way

389
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:46,849
because every change starts in you so of

390
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:48,658
course you can always complain and say

391
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:50,908
society sucks and

392
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:53,220
I hate those politicians and we know

393
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:56,090
people that talk like that right but

394
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,460
change actually always begins in you so

395
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:02,699
if you have this whole consciousness

396
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,059
karma positivity discussion up believe

397
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,249
it

398
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,658
I think it's true I mean it was that

399
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:09,450
story that happened to me a couple of

400
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,129
days ago where I paid this super nice

401
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:15,450
guy a beer because he forgot his wallet

402
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:16,799
at tenth and yeah you know he came back

403
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,269
the next day he gave me the money for

404
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,418
the beer and he gave me an extra five

405
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:23,789
and he told me hey you gave me this even

406
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:28,259
if I might not have found you and stuff

407
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:30,179
like that here you get the since you get

408
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,399
this five extra and then I shared it to

409
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,690
the next person and of course this is a

410
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:37,709
the karma train that will never stop I

411
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,529
think a lot of people still didn't

412
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:43,859
understand that and it's not as

413
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:48,299
unimportant as you think well not you in

414
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:52,939
certain but society and also one point I

415
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:56,460
really observe in every social area

416
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:00,899
knowledge has to be shared jealousy

417
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:04,229
always returns so even in the left-wing

418
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:07,529
where people share usually everywhere

419
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:09,809
people Envy each other but it's idiotic

420
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:13,139
to do that if you're jealous about

421
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:14,609
something somebody else reached it's

422
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:19,158
going to give you a bad feeling it's

423
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:21,178
gonna fuck up your own shit in English I

424
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:22,320
think a lot of people still didn't

425
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,869
understand that and it's really

426
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:31,080
important and yeah he's Sophia

427
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:35,119
she's my starting point for any

428
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:39,359
discussion because I think she's like I

429
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:42,809
don't know kind of like Trump but in a

430
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,689
technology way so yeah

431
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:48,299
does anyone want to say something okay

432
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,399
so as always if you have something to

433
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,859
contribute we have to microphone angels

434
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:55,109
and because of the recording you need to

435
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:57,689
speak into a microphone to be heard so

436
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,519
please line up behind the microphone

437
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,630
angels all make yourself visible to them

438
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:12,550
then they may also come to you

439
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:14,830
all right there we go on stage left hey

440
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,940
I liked your talk and I agree with your

441
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:20,889
premise a lot and I think since you know

442
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,130
we're talking about how we're already

443
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,960
kind of cybernetic and how media and

444
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,300
communication we're all influencing each

445
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,980
other and our ideas are living on is

446
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,340
there something really special you find

447
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,890
about the way about specifically body

448
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,419
modification like what your own personal

449
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,040
body has to do with that if that

450
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,670
question makes sense like is there some

451
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,820
potency in the body yeah well I see that

452
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,500
really futuristic because I'm I mean of

453
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,950
course we have wearables and we have

454
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,750
smartphones but to me a smartphone is

455
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:56,980
already a bodily extension because it's

456
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:58,330
a it's a brain prosthetic my iCloud it's

457
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,360
it's that shit

458
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,520
I cannot store in my brain well or

459
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,360
whatever cloud I don't want to use it to

460
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Apple but I have all those storages and

461
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,719
all that stuff but it represents my

462
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,120
memory in a technical way so yeah I

463
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:22,630
think it's really important to use the

464
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:25,300
body even you know like create some nano

465
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:28,360
stuff that can be inside of you and

466
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,430
morph because it's it's stupid we are

467
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,070
wasting the planet but I think by

468
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:37,030
generally generating energy out of our

469
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:39,220
own body out of ourselves we could we

470
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:43,030
could maybe stop that even if it's too

471
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:46,150
late maybe we could find ways to connect

472
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,639
with machines to use AI to you know save

473
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:54,280
voltage to generate solar cells to

474
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:58,420
improve productivity in a way it's not

475
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:01,590
going to destroy things basically thanks

476
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,600
all right any other questions or

477
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,669
contributions otherwise maybe if someone

478
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,860
could just volunteer to have a look at

479
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,450
this stream like at the ISC and Twitter

480
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,719
to see if anyone else has a question

481
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,340
that's not in the room I don't think we

482
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,250
have a signal angel officially but

483
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:23,860
maybe someone can step up and become a

484
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:26,400
signal angel temporarily otherwise do

485
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:30,820
you have anything else you want to say

486
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:34,470
no that's all I wanted to say I'm not

487
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:37,270
really good in talking out I'm more a

488
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,930
connecting person so I'm gonna switch

489
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,190
the yellow LED and my cardio on and if

490
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,110
you want to come up and talk to me

491
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,180
face-to-face that's much more

492

to collect all your opinions and kind of

494

like put it into my art which is not

495
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,900
only a narcissistic approach it's more

496
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,510

497

498
