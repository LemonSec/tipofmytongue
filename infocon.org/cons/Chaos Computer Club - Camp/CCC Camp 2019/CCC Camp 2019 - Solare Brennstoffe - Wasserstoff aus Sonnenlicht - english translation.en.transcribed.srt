1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,140
[Music]

2
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:21,000
we're gonna talk about how to produce

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,460
hydrogen by using this fusion reactor

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,270
that is always hovering above us and how

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,300
that works

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:34,899
stoma will show us please applaud him

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:44,300
[Applause]

8
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:45,100
yeah good model yeah good morning oh all

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,050
right

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,000
that's a communist Oliver sighs sorry

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,739
welcome thanks good that you're all

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,610
awake I'm a chemist I have worked with

13
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:00,169
organic chemistry with biochemistry and

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:06,408
lately with physical and

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:08,780
electrochemistry I wrote a master's

16
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:12,979
thesis at the Hamilton home in Berlin

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:17,170
Ramsey and there I dealt with this

18
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,399
subject how to find materials to produce

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:24,500
to solve the energy problems of the

20
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:28,190
future so short agenda

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:32,690
how many agenda do we need per year I'm

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:35,569
going to go over some basics I'm not

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,369
going to dive deep some chemistry and

24
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:40,099
physics from school will be useful some

25
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:44,289
of you may remember the basics then

26
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:47,030
we'll look the well-known silicon

27
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:50,000
photovoltaic cells that are spread over

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,489
this over this cam then you need to

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,179
store the energy somehow I'm going to

30
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:58,789
talk about that shortly and then how to

31
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:09,459
couple this way with a new class of

32
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:18,700
materials so a bra neck 9 so

33
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:22,319
um doesn't spire doesn't slide these are

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:29,888
two diagrams from rocket egg

35
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:33,159
it is a council group for academia and

36
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:37,299
technology architect that is this pie

37
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:42,340
chart on the left looks like we have

38
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:44,769
only two percent solar energy some part

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,620
of renewable energy but most of it's

40
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:52,389
still from fossil fuels and on the right

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:57,189
side we see a diagram from the BP annual

42
00:02:52,389 --> 00:03:02,139
reports BP you know them refueling

43
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:05,849
station the oil producer they write a

44
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:09,159
report on energy consumption every year

45
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:11,918
and you see this spike downwards pretty

46
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:16,929
well 2008 2009 when the world financial

47
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:19,090
crisis was and the changed went up back

48
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,099
again and now we have an increase in

49
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:27,370
energy consumption of 3 percent per year

50
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:29,349
which is a a three-year high and on the

51
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,939
right we see that the carbon dioxide

52
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:35,319
emissions have also increased so this

53
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,299
climate change thing is everywhere

54
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,839
everybody's talking about it and it's

55
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:45,129
time that even more people talk about it

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,729
here's the change over the years

57
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:53,048
consumption of primary energy the

58
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:55,870
composition is on the top coal then in

59
00:03:53,049 --> 00:04:00,370
orange the renewable energies then we

60
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:05,500
have hydroelectricity the the bright

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:10,120
orange is nuclear energy then gas and in

62
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:14,199
green oil megatron calculation is in

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:17,660
megatons oil equivalent mt OE do you

64
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:24,680
believe that is the usual unit

65
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:28,550
and these are 166 petawatt hours - as a

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:34,160
recall pata is the one unit after Tara

67
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:39,740
so thousand terawatt-hours or 19 Tara

68
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,700
what years per year so you could you

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,030
could cross it out

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,060
the earth has a rated power of 19

71
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,729
terawatt Hong Kong has one our embassy

72
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,840
meow thankfully a lot more comes from

73
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,030
the energy from the Sun 179 petawatt so

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,929
more or less in fact 10,000 more

75
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:05,559
that's a graphic from NASA originally

76
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,910
the incoming radiation ninja in yellow

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,420
and the different ways how this

78
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:17,780
radiation is reflected going back to the

79
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:21,020
universe or staying on the ground 89

80
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,859
petawatt arrive at the ground that's

81
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:28,130
more than enough to cover all the demand

82
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,310
here's a repetition the more orange you

83
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:35,840
see on the map the more intense the Sun

84
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:42,350
radiation is that is average over the

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:44,330
year and the black dots are some spaces

86
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,660
with high radiation for example North

87
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:51,349
America the Great Basin Nevada desert or

88
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:56,150
South America atacama desert Sahara

89
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:59,300
Desert and these black dots alone would

90
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,789
cover those with solar panels would

91
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,930
cover the whole energy demand of the

92
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,820
world what is actually reaching us

93
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,770
that's the spectral intensity of

94
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:16,790
sunlight remember from school this

95
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:19,400
theory with black body radiation that is

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:23,780
the yellow curve and the orange curve is

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,330
the actually measured radiation outside

98
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,460
of the atmosphere inside the atmosphere

99
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,120
it's a little bit different that is the

100
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,960
lower curve

101
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,169
but you see the the the rainbow it's the

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,960
visible spectrum is it not just desert

103
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,960
and these notches that you can see are

104
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:50,849
actually filled filtered by water gas in

105
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,180
the atmosphere water has several

106
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:57,630
absorption bands and the right side of

107
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,880
the graphic they absorb radiation from a

108
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,310
price that has already been considered

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,080
in the diagram we just saw before which

110
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,669
also means that the more arid your

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,909
region is the less clouds you have the

112
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,919
harder it will be in the oceans on the

113
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,180
land and this whole story will run even

114
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,859
faster young standardize all of this the

115
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,250
atmospheric mass model has been

116
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,610
developed we place we have different

117
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,990
details different level of details so

118
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:33,240
the first approximation is the earth I'm

119
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:37,740
tell of the other I'll put a plate on

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,700
the earth you see where does it go back

121
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,889
in the atmosphere in the right angle and

122
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,300
the angle between the Sun and this

123
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,950
reflection is the presented angle

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,539
divided and then the atmosphere will be

125
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:59,039
passed only once if you go a bit more to

126
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:03,270
the north or to the south then even at

127
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:07,110
12 o'clock at summer solstice the Sun

128
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:11,880
will enter in an angle that is the a.m.

129
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:14,550
1.5 that's the usual radiation force in

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,349
Europe and northern America the in the

131
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,840
Stila now and because that's the

132
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:22,950
industry industrial countries that has

133
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,530
been used as a standard for measurements

134
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,380
but more to the north that would be 60

135
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,349
degrees Scandinavia for example that's a

136
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,870
m2 this equivalent for means that the

137
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:36,419
equivalent of 2 atmosphere thicknesses

138
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,750
are being traversed by the vital

139
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,409
radiation and if you see the Sun just

140
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:47,000
above the horizon at 90 degrees

141
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:52,050
in the more detailed models that is in

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,030
38 fold atmosphere penetration and of

143
00:08:52,050 --> 00:09:00,030
course in the in space that is Ames ero

144
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,970
because there's no atmosphere at all so

145
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,230
you cannot wait until summer solstice to

146
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,030
make your measurements when there's

147
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,280
absolutely no clouds so that means in

148
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,530
the lab you mean you need a Sun

149
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,939
simulator that is the device

150
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:17,640
I made my measurements with you see in

151
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,340
the left side the control PC that's

152
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,620
where all the electronics is put in in

153
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:26,520
the middle is the measurement cell and

154
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:31,320
on the right this black L is the light

155
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:35,510
source here let's see it in detail the

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,130
white thing is the electrochemical cell

157
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:41,700
wires go to the mass electronics

158
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:46,160
measurement electronics and on the right

159
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:51,120
we have an aperture in order to go from

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,780
dark to clear quickly and on the right

161
00:09:51,120 --> 00:10:01,860
we have X in on light that you also have

162
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:04,800
in cars these super clear bright bluish

163
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,960
lights arc Sanon lights why do we take

164
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,719
them well we need to model the Sun

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,340
spectrum pretty efficiently if you take

166
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,160
incandescent lamps then you reach 3000

167
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,410
3500 Kelvin you know the light

168
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,949
temperature that is exactly that data

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,579
and that orange thing is the Sun

170
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,890
spectrum and there you see that the blue

171
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,590
parts are just not well represented and

172
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:35,640
therefore you need that bluish light and

173
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:38,340
it is modulated with filters in order to

174
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:43,890
reach this equivalent of the intensity

175
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:47,000
in the cell about solar cells we've all

176
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,030
seen them before the shadow widths and

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,950
arrive at silicon and this is split into

178
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:58,040
their flat wafers I have sustained

179
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,870
you reach these glittering

180
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,260
polycrystalline solar cells at the mono

181
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,600
crystal like in the chip industry vain

182
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,050
hyperbole but in solar cells you luckily

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,240
don't need this high purity like you

184
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:18,270
need on ships in industry you usually

185
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:22,170
need about 99.999 degrees of purity and

186
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:24,230
solar industry you 99.5 are enough so

187
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,620
you can work with very simple processes

188
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,660
so how does the current come out of this

189
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:38,610
moody on the left hand side you see a

190
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:41,790
model a silicon semiconductor and the

191
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:45,750
solar cell the bluish part is the one

192
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,719
irradiated by Sun and the red one is the

193
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,790
actual material which you don't see you

194
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,960
and in between the electrical current

195
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:58,290
runs silicon solar cells this is 0.6 to

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,420
0.7 volts and the radiation intensity

197
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,670
determines how much current you get out

198
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,180
of the solar cell so if there's a cloud

199
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,680
above it gets darker and of course

200
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,790
eventually the current and voltage drop

201
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,819
down on the right hand side we see what

202
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,860
this cell actually absorbs the dark one

203
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:21,210
is the Sun spectrum that comes into the

204
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:24,120
cell the yellowish curve is the actually

205
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,150
used part of the spectrum in between you

206
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,070
see the bandgap at a temperature of 300

207
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:34,260
Kelvin yeah

208
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,890
which corresponds to the base state of

209
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,500
the valence band it's going up to the

210
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,710
state of the conducting band and the gap

211
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:49,860
in between is the actual band gap which

212
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:52,140
you can deduct as a voltage so the

213
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,500
energy is calculated by H times nu which

214
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,560
is a blank column times the irradiation

215
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,890
frequency which is also corresponding to

216
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,579
the color of the incoming light

217
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:08,790
so here the orange region is the visible

218
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,420
light up till infrared spectrum and then

219
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,819
there's a shot

220
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,170
nice nails guys on in school but we just

221
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,080
due to the energy of the incoming

222
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,729
photons not being sufficient anymore to

223
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,610
actually bridge the gap into the

224
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:28,740
conduction band so this light simply

225
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,420
isn't absorbed oh it's going to be

226
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,210
interesting later in the talk because

227
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,430
this is actually the upper limit

228
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:37,350
regarding efficiency that we can get out

229
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,120
of our solar cells because otherwise the

230
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,790
material simply can't catch the photons

231
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,920
anymore so here we have the bore at a

232
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:52,770
model which explains the atom as divided

233
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,689
into the core and the shell so here's an

234
00:13:52,770 --> 00:14:00,480
excitation from a second to the third

235
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:02,130
shell sending out a quantum of light and

236
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,870
this is exactly what we want regarding

237
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,100
solar cells so there's a photon coming

238
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:11,370
in and there's an energy excitation

239
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,410
sending out and generating a voltage

240
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,820
difference which is what we can use in

241
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:23,730
our solar cells simple path models in

242
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:25,920
this case magnesia wouldn't the the

243
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,390
electron tire diseases and see that all

244
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,180
atoms in my compound share the electrons

245
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,730
the so-called covalent binding which

246
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,290
forms the valence band

247
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,480
that's highest of the conduction band is

248
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,300
only slightly above this valence band so

249
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,910
with only a little push in energy to the

250
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,800
electrons which they can already assume

251
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,380
at room temperature the electrons can

252
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:55,530
freely move and electronic conductivity

253
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:56,780
is established however which is silicon

254
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,760
which is the semiconductor

255
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,380
exactas lightning sponge quasi detect on

256
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,089
valence band runner in a matter that

257
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,740
again the valence and conduction bands

258
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:08,490
are very close to each other and the

259
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:12,089
band gap is sufficient however in a

260
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:15,600
nonconductor the conduction band is too

261
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,700
far away so no light and no electrical

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,350
energy is sufficient to get the

263
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,839
electrons into the conduction band

264
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,960
they're stuck with their atom cores and

265
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,089
the materials not kind

266
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,480
would diesel and the average of these

267
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:33,250
two is the semiconductor where the

268
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,310
bandgap is in the region below

269
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,350
approximately four electron volts which

270
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,219
roughly corresponds to ultraviolet light

271
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:45,670
and a bit lower corresponding to a

272
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,390
yellowish shade so silicon has a band

273
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,430
gap of about 1.2 electron volts which

274
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,420
corresponds to the infrared spectrum of

275
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:57,520
light is a in a given a little electron

276
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,650
void as all this energy is usually

277
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,110
expressed in electron volts which is

278
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,430
that elementary charge times the voltage

279
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,690
that was obtained by this charge

280
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,040
absolutely now everybody should have

281
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,670
heard about this concept tags is known

282
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,750
however what happens if we get

283
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,150
semiconductor into direct contact with

284
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,480
water

285
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:27,250
is these electron demons so photo

286
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:31,450
electrochemical cells can detect

287
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,550
actually conduct wouldn't electrons

288
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,500
directly into water so not by an outer

289
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:41,579
circuit but rather directly into water

290
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,950
splitting the water into hydrogen oxygen

291
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,110
by that omitting an outer circuit which

292
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:51,100
would of course cause losses in

293
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,080
efficiencies on besar so the one point

294
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,930
two or three electron volts we see is

295
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,060
the Braddock's potential of water which

296
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,620
is a minimum potential it has to be

297
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,949
surmounted in order to start this

298
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:07,990
process those red arrows are the so

299
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:11,920
called over potentials the false so in

300
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,910
the band gap we ideally need to split

301
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,670
water into hydrogen oxygen would be

302
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,270
approximately higher than 1.8 electron

303
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,280
volts

304
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,540
considering the over potentials as well

305
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,670
as does detect heat and we saw so far

306
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,649
that we obtained no material that was

307
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,429
actually able to perform this right away

308
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:35,470
so we had to introduce some tricks

309
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,440
mustard seller to do this schematic of a

310
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,380
photo electrochemical

311
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,540
14 comprising two half-cells so the

312
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,570
light enters the blue layer on the right

313
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,590
hand side these are very thin layers in

314
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:53,980
the region of 10 to 20 nanometers in the

315
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,959
minimal case or up to 100 nanometers in

316
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,740
a thicker case but then we have

317
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,650
stability issues in Elektra lutein

318
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,570
warszawa and the Rays transcend a

319
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,180
membrane which in this case is

320
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:11,530
water-based and arrive on the other side

321
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:13,690
on the red photocathode with the light

322
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,389
that still reaches the other the red

323
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,840
side can start the process of splitting

324
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,540
the water so the electrodes kind of

325
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,379
share the work and only the one

326
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,820
electrode has to surmount the work to

327
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,840
provide the electrons for these

328
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:34,540
processes the Undong button lighter also

329
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,649
Moomba lighted electrons are conducted

330
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:43,629
via an outer conductor coming back to

331
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:47,440
the photo a note in for exact is a

332
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:50,080
photovoltaic cell oh I'm sorry they come

333
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,250
back to the photo cathode via this

334
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:57,100
other's outer circuit bus is Okazaki

335
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,680
Vulcan who the energy but then we also

336
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,760
said we need higher energies than 1.2

337
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,070
electron volt much they are hot good we

338
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,940
have higher energies and a larger band

339
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:12,879
gap in a material understand only

340
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,700
high-energy radiation is absorbed

341
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,730
everything below it gets lost so it's

342
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,010
only used for example ultraviolet or

343
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,870
green light so what do we do with the

344
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,190
remaining radiation we just send it into

345
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:31,469
the next cell so from the left-hand side

346
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:35,740
the full spectrum light would reach a

347
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:37,510
yellowish photocatalytic material then

348
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,520
performs the first part of the active

349
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,700
reaction and the remaining irradiation

350
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,520
reaches the material behind the

351
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,400
yellowish part which is maybe then in

352
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,139
the reddish yellow spectrum and on the

353
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,580
back side it just reaches a

354
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,640
photovoltaic cells how it is highest

355
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,500
dusters on the right-hand side the image

356
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,460
is mirrored but the general it shows the

357
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,520
same processes the full-spectrum light

358
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,450
excites as many electrons as it can

359
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,070
everything else that doesn't manage to

360
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:16,100
do that shines through end of silicon

361
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:19,820
material reaches the silicon solar cell

362
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,580
and does its normal work so it's a kind

363
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:26,840
of tandem solar cell working together as

364
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,460
a compound Menken about sang-man tight

365
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,470
isn't functional bye-bye in spite time

366
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,320
so we're actually parting this orange

367
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:38,510
region into two parts the higher energy

368
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,549
part on the left hand side is absorbed

369
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,240
by photochemical material and the rest

370
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:47,030
the remains for the silicon solar cell

371
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,360
it was even if it's by water by

372
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,620
starvation a simple cost yeah this

373
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,149
material on the right hand side is

374
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,090
marked by fe2o3

375
00:20:53,150 --> 00:21:00,429
which is simply in the breast it's just

376
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:03,290
corroded I usually use metal oxides

377
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:05,510
because they're very practical they're

378
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,799
stable they're widely available

379
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:11,419
MIPS but the problem is of course in the

380
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:15,350
periodic table of elements there's like

381
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:18,530
50 60 metals and then we're running out

382
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:25,100
of possibilities for materials you know

383
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:27,879
lots of work that's in fire so what are

384
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,659
the materials could we use below the

385
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:35,990
yellowish part this one is marked as

386
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:38,510
smooth vanadium and oxygen coming out so

387
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,850
on the script it's my country and if we

388
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,390
calculate how many actual combinations

389
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:47,330
of metal oxides we could have we end up

390
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:50,299
in the four digit region so we have a

391
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,760
lot of experimental grounds on which to

392
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,860
try which materials and which

393
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,600
combination of elements could be

394
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,129
suitable for these processes because of

395
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,639
course they all have different band gaps

396
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,890
they all absorb different energies and

397
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,669
could be more or less suitable for the

398
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,450
aim of

399
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:13,090
bring water Jordan in a steamer Medeiros

400
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:16,070
by Hume going back to energy storage

401
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:19,449
this is an excerpt from Agora and a

402
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,039
given tour energy transition report

403
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,539
marking the German wide energy

404
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:30,109
consumption over one and a half months

405
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:32,840
is the purple curve in the middle is the

406
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:35,960
most interesting one over so it's

407
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:39,980
actually the pink one which is the

408
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:45,259
demand for energy come on Ashley Indian

409
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,909
bhai does the energy in again on the

410
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:49,879
first of May we actually entered the

411
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,590
region that regenerative energies would

412
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:55,459
have been able to actually cover the

413
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,230
whole demand fact once worked I realize

414
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,889
that that can be put down to different

415
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,769
factors so of course we had a different

416
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:05,899
very high Sunday radiation it was a

417
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:08,509
public holiday in Germany so with a

418
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:11,508
quite lower energy demand and for the

419
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:14,749
first time we found this inversions that

420
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:17,090
could have actually just been able to

421
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:22,639
shut down conventional power plants and

422
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:24,439
use the renewables instead enjoyment of

423
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:26,090
inertial limousine one of the

424
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,879
applications would be simple

425
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,559
electrolysis everyone might probably

426
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:34,219
have seen this in their chemical essence

427
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,168
so we put in electricity in the water

428
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,869
and split it into its components

429
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,809
hydrogen oxygen which works quite well

430
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:44,119
in principle unfortunately the most

431
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:51,109
effective alert codes in this context

432
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:54,980
are platinum electrodes so platinum is

433
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:57,408
the material that very much is most

434
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,409
efficient in spreading water perform a

435
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:03,470
electrolysis so me tired of the Olivia

436
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:08,929
motors also not as rare as metals like

437
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:11,149
iridium for instance both divers in ones

438
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:13,639
are modern electronic which for instance

439
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:15,939
also components of our modern electronic

440
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:18,040
devices these are an order of magnitude

441
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,070
rarer

442
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:26,710
the man gets dim process in ainít

443
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:29,320
sailors on board however if we all three

444
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:34,030
concepts that I mentioned within one

445
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:36,399
photo active cell type like I said which

446
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,410
means generating a stack of three

447
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,560
different semiconducting materials which

448
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:44,200
absorb different colors marked by blue

449
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:48,520
green and red here in this case in

450
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:54,310
viagra Deanna Givaudan conducting in

451
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:57,010
series are setting up a series on and

452
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:01,240
immersed in water then we actually have

453
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:04,180
a cell which can split water into

454
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:09,640
hydrogen and oxygen by only being

455
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:12,370
irradiated by light ensign yet does

456
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,470
video by me raw fish

457
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,469
so on my screen the video doesn't work

458
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,590
as bluebirds have for one can out a

459
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,420
smashed exciting there's bubbles this is

460
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,030
actually or what I want to show in this

461
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,760
video there are class of the Lincoln

462
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,590
site is the site of our stuff so the

463
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,370
circle on the left hand side is where

464
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,649
hydrogen is developing I'm still Asakusa

465
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,770
you know that stock geometrically the

466
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,500
bubbles have to be larger one of the

467
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,030
anxiety is this is covered with platinum

468
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
and on the other side on the right hand

469
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,840
side we have Racine iam

470
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,880
oxide on the electrode which is also

471
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,000
quite rare metal and one of the only

472
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,460
oxides that are actually able to

473
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,400
catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction

474
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,630
or oxidation reaction in this case in a

475
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:09,220
very good way and sort of two systems in

476
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:15,550
Viera decisis in general about oxygen

477
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:17,740
needs a kind of conviction how to via

478
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,330
participate in this reaction which of

479
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,700
course we want to reduce because the

480
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:26,020
over potential time supplied current is

481
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:29,970
an electrical power output which we lose

482
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,970
in this case in the reaction

483
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,150
I guess this everybody has seen in

484
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,389
school as well that's a kind of

485
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:41,260
biological cell the chlorophyll in the

486
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:43,840
nature the same principle first call for

487
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,810
absorbs light of a first wavelength

488
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,459
it's excited then over this step that

489
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:53,139
you see in the next it D deactivates a

490
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,080
little bit then on the second

491
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:59,260
photosystem it is really excited I think

492
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,480
it gets a harder push and the energy of

493
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:05,050
the second photo system is strong enough

494
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:08,380
to push the following reaction and carry

495
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:11,320
out the photosynthesis in the plant so

496
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,600
that's also that would be the global the

497
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,389
big picture I hope that you have more

498
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,730
questions than before that from foolish

499
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,580
Danna and I would like to answer some of

500
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:26,420
those

501
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:26,419
[Applause]

502
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:34,760
so you can't ask a you know you know the

503
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,980
drill there's two microphone angels one

504
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,990
on the left one on the right if least go

505
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,230
see them if you have questions if you're

506
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:44,570
in the stream you have lost because

507
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:50,360
there's no signal angel I'm very sorry

508
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:52,639
oh hi how is it with efficiencies and

509
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,129
the wear and tear of the materials that

510
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,620
are being used now that's a good point

511
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,710
silicon solar cells while the

512
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,469
theoretical limit is 30 to 33 percent

513
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:06,880
from thermodynamics in practice the best

514
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:10,550
cells have a bit more than 20% the

515
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,090
super-expensive for military and space

516
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:17,330
applications have 25% the electrolysis

517
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:20,830
behind depending on how good inexpensive

518
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:24,980
the catalysts are 70 80 maybe 90 percent

519
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:28,939
and that means in the sum we have 15 20

520
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:32,750
% stop in this stack cell where we saw

521
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:36,380
the video there was the efficiency

522
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:39,850
written next it 9.5% that is pretty good

523
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:43,070
but I mean these materials deliver

524
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:46,370
efficiencies we're talking about the

525
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:49,760
solar to hydrogen efficiency as th my

526
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:52,550
since that is usually be below 1%

527
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,310
sometimes maybe 1 points or 2 point

528
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:58,330
something percent there's a lot to do

529
00:28:54,310 --> 00:29:03,260
and the stability also good point is

530
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:07,429
generally I mean in the process the

531
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:11,840
materials being corroded in general we

532
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:14,050
bring on passivation layers to enhance

533
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,250
the lifetime so in the lab we reach

534
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:19,399
lifetimes of a week or something like

535
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:22,700
that and usually that is already good

536
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:25,310
but sometimes within minutes they get

537
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,710
decomposed so we need to look at these

538
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:31,340
thousands of combinations of which

539
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:35,390
material works has good efficiency and

540
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:39,199
isn't Ditka posts within minutes another

541
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:42,559
question from that side I saw in the

542
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:48,220
media that apparently a come

543
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:51,499
has developed a prisoner to use the non

544
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:56,360
- to shift the unusable part of the

545
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:57,950
light spectrum into the usable part well

546
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,939
for me that sounds like frequent

547
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:03,320
doubling there are nonlinear optics of

548
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:08,720
you has already seen a green laser

549
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:11,840
pointer I'm or less everybody that's

550
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:16,100
actually an infrared laser that is being

551
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,168
sent through this nonlinear optics which

552
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,629
sends out everything that is green but

553
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:23,779
it only works very selectively for

554
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:26,240
narrow spectrum so I don't know if that

555
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:30,619
is actually what you mean but otherwise

556
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,080
the convert the color yeah I don't know

557
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:35,869
a process that can do that and I don't

558
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,830
know how efficient that would be in

559
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:41,360
these green laser pointers have a

560
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:46,820
terrible efficiency from electrical

561
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,019
power to light hey let's move on a small

562
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:53,269
question is a big question small

563
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:55,279
question is how necessarily Clee how

564
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,649
clean does the water need to be I guess

565
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,769
that if you take just tap water in large

566
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:03,889
quantities that after some time the

567
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:07,070
catalysts will be dirty or something

568
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:09,918
like this botanic you generally don't

569
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,580
want to clean the water with a lot of

570
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:18,049
energy I guess and the other question

571
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:21,980
once can we imagine molecules that are

572
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:24,950
specially engineered named one to absorb

573
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,580
light and split water into hydrogen and

574
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,149
oxygen

575
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,820
I mean if we had that molecule we could

576
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:34,070
maybe create a DNA strand that we can

577
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:38,740
put into bacteria and then engineer

578
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:42,879
bacterias in order to conceive carry out

579
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:45,710
for that electrolysis or that

580
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:47,689
photosynthesis that splits water widely

581
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:52,070
open versions wide enough we're so far

582
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:54,600
in the technology question and regarding

583
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:58,110
water purity well

584
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,418
I've only dealt with lab setups so we

585
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,039
have ultra pure water which is called

586
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:08,370
milli poor has super low conductivity

587
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,870
almost none impurities inside because

588
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:13,469
the problem is we're talking about redox

589
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:19,549
chemistry so if other redox active

590
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:22,649
materials are implied salt metals lead

591
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:25,500
copper they are also being reduced and

592
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:29,008
oxidized electro chemically Syngenta you

593
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:31,549
will be dropping copper or lead you can

594
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:36,169
poison your material with that yeah

595
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:39,120
inside that's fine man and in doubt you

596
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:43,049
drop your efficiency talking about

597
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,879
filters and partake particles yeah you

598
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,220
don't want them so you need to filter

599
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:49,259
your stuff I can't tell you more detail

600
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,980
about that unfortunately regarding the

601
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:56,970
second question yeah there is such

602
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,070
things that's called Gretl cell somebody

603
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:07,190
worked on it and received the Nobel

604
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:11,330
Prize there was organic colorants on a

605
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:17,549
conductive support which was then

606
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:20,250
excited and the electrons were lad

607
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:22,500
offered there was a big hit for us

608
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,889
sometime I don't know how that has

609
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:32,460
developed for today it's a very special

610
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:34,080
man service you can do that at home to

611
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,440
make that work it's pretty simple

612
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,399
I mean organic colorant something like

613
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:43,889
can do that with with fruit he actually

614
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:48,350
is long off that doesn't live for a long

615
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:52,168
time also here this the incoming light

616
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:56,600
excites the molecules but they wear out

617
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:59,399
and don't work after sometimes when I

618
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,610
don't know how the practical

619
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:04,030
applications look like okay 10 minutes

620
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,850
left

621
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:11,320
who wants to ask a question maybe from

622
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:16,509
the left mic da you want you know

623
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:18,370
there's somebody standing up I might as

624
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:27,159
microphone unbidden yeah this is true

625
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:30,100
not exact it skipped there is this

626
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:34,720
combination of solar cells and fuel

627
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:37,389
cells seems only to be working in the

628
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,719
lab there's a lot of talk about I mean

629
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:45,100
you can just take solar cells and then

630
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:48,879
own the branch of the hint solar fuel

631
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:51,339
cell behind it to produce just just a

632
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,230
break you mean fuel cell or electrolysis

633
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,990
I mean electrolysis fuel cell comes

634
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,360
afterwards to use the hydrogen yeah

635
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:00,850
exactly that's a whole other chapter but

636
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,940
yeah my question is you see how it's the

637
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:07,569
Tigra from bow that is state-of-the-art

638
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,030
isn't it is that much more inefficient

639
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:13,420
or why do you want to go to this direct

640
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:16,420
coupling is the citation on that and how

641
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,360
far are we still in the future that's a

642
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:24,540
very good question probably a couple of

643
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:27,370
years ahead you know that solar power or

644
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,790
renewable power to electrolysis is being

645
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:33,970
done today the problem is on the one

646
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:37,120
hand it's half of course before of curve

647
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:41,950
off and I put up this slide sand to

648
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:46,029
silicon to solar cell it seems easy but

649
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:49,180
needs a lot of energy Ziya good thoughts

650
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,950
a very well researched process mostly

651
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,009
because the chip industry that had big

652
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,830
interest in to that but the production

653
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:59,200
from solar cells needs a lot of energy

654
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:01,509
and the amortization times are somewhere

655
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,029
in the domain of two three four or five

656
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:07,150
years until the solar cell has

657
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,640
compensated harvested the amount of

658
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:12,460
energy it has cost to produce being

659
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,970
produced on yachts in the lifetimes are

660
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,960
in the domain of decades 20 25 30 years

661
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,810
easily and that means

662
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,440
that afterlife time they still perform

663
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:28,299
80 85 percent of their energy so one

664
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,240
argument would be you can save the

665
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:36,109
energy to produce silicon from silicon

666
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:41,060
silicon dioxide the metal oxides are

667
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:43,790
already energy low materials how you

668
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,369
know that iron is resting because Ross

669
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:51,800
is a lower energy level than metallic

670
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:53,839
iron so the idea would be you get the

671
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,630
raw materials more easily

672
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,849
well silicon is one of the most frequent

673
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,020
materials we have in most abundant

674
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:04,880
materials we have the crust of the earth

675
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:08,270
the idea is we want to produce all of

676
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,130
that with less energy the next point is

677
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,050
that electrolysis is only working

678
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,740
efficiently and well if you have these

679
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:20,770
expensive valuable material catalysts

680
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:23,959
noble material catalysts so you can

681
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:26,150
lower the system costs instead of

682
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,550
building a solar farm and then an

683
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,670
electrolyzer and you have to maintain

684
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:35,210
them so that would be a possibility to

685
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:39,050
save money but how well that will be in

686
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,940
the end we will see next you know him

687
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,310
and does anyone else want to ask a

688
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,839
question of lighting this insights we

689
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,420
were working on a frog referral maybe to

690
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:50,359
bridge some time I have a question for

691
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,430
Diamond active and as Ohana kismet does

692
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:55,450
anyone do active research on these

693
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:59,950
materials so is there any working groups

694
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:03,140
you know that maybe simulate or just try

695
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:06,200
these kinds of materials out yes for its

696
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:10,250
for instance my working group so indeed

697
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,500
this very contemporary topic and it's

698
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:16,270
one that has been done by very excellent

699
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,230
research groups Diwali under a

700
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:22,599
stationary mission there's also the

701
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:25,420
variant of quantum chemically simulating

702
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:31,160
Mankins similar to these materials on

703
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:33,740
very big cluster one done upset since

704
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,930
okay to calculate the band gaps of these

705
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,700
materials and determine whether they

706
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,529
actually exhibit the properties that

707
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,930
we're looking for but actually I don't

708
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:47,240
know what the state of the art in this

709
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:50,140
respect is but in order to do this sighs

710
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,209
Lee we have to invest a lot of

711
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,529
calculations power and energy and it

712
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,720
could still be that theory doesn't

713
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:59,480
really match reality in this respect or

714
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,310
that the material works and has the

715
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,190
property that we desire but then

716
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:07,759
degrades and doesn't exhibit the

717
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,830
lifetime that we wish for so it's really

718
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,950
the literal search for the needle in the

719
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,840
haystack it's about the human taken

720
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:18,819
strong wish for a body detecting so

721
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:23,410
that's okay we talked about directly you

722
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:26,990
direct electrolysis and changing the

723
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:29,240
electricity into water electrolysis many

724
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,160
of you have Merton mingwan masam as a de

725
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,140
Conti fashionista gansan talked about

726
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,629
the amorous cancer camp long as of us

727
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,750
so I could talk about this for the whole

728
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:42,440
camp but are there any alternative

729
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:47,570
processes to actually perform this yes

730
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:52,100
for instance bioenergy mice so for

731
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:54,830
instance Lansing sushi indeed on in BO

732
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,650
disease for instance corn crops and

733
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:01,730
changing them into by ethanol and by

734
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,650
reactors which is also the refueling

735
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,470
station discussion this is actually

736
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,720
being done but I don't have the total

737
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:13,430
efficiency in mind I think however that

738
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,299
it's not very big just a few percent in

739
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,609
Manaus

740
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:21,410
and also of course we then compete

741
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:25,330
against our own nutrition generation the

742
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:30,560
planet I emitted this topic on therapist

743
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:33,410
for instance some spike and some neem -

744
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,960
mind it's from nuts importance is

745
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,089
hydroelectric storages this I omitted

746
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,140
and purpose because it's another very

747
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:45,000
big topic shadows fresh that's for the

748
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:49,270
electrode Lucinda here

749
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,880
vas Alchemist what is the zonin energy

750
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:56,080
but what for instance is also done is to

751
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:00,040
directly to focus in on damage translate

752
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:02,500
solar energy under water just evaporate

753
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,660
water and then drive turbines whither

754
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:08,800
which is for insistent in Spain or in

755
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:10,270
Sahara Desert honey time but otherwise I

756
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,710
don't have any spontaneous idea about

757
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,830
other couple processes

758
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:17,400
I'm pehangi know so we have room for a

759
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:24,700
couple more questions okay is it get

760
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:28,060
done good Dunn's another good douche

761
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:35,230
cook-off ok so everyone is heated up and

762
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:38,040
let's thank our speaker again you have

763
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,040
listened to the talk

764
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,599
[Music]

765
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,900
you
