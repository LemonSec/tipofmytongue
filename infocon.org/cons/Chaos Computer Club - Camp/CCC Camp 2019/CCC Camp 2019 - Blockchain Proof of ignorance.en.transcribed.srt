1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,279
[Music]

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:22,750
hey everyone second day of CCC camp here

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,288
on playing stage we have our next talk

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,780
right now coming up with Reiner as a

5
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:34,150
huge applause for Reiner first fall out

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:37,690
of speaker Reiner will talk about

7
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,449
blockchain and what's currently math not

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,269
so good or what's maybe not so good in

9
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:47,949
the future with blockchain and yeah so

10
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:50,440
in the end we will do a short Q&A and I

11
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:53,710
will come to you with this microphone so

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,820
you can so we have your question on the

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:03,339
recording as well and yeah that's pretty

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:07,590
much it so a la a bomb welcome and have

15
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:18,810
fun with China and yeah blockchain and

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:23,200
proof of ignorance okay hello everyone I

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,740
think now the slide will come up soon

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,360
that's the magic of technology I guess

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,610
yes so this is one slide and it will

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,330
stay like this as I've mentioned in the

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:37,150
program this will may have some grains

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,940
of a rant so you can listen to me and

23
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,650
there's nothing to see there

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,840
okay so blockchain proof of ignorance I

25
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,990
chose the subtitle to a title with

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,320
liberty and justice for some maybe you

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,509
know the book by Glenn Greenwald I think

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,750
from 2011 where he analyzed the u.s.

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:58,150
system where in the opposition to the

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,920
Constitution where it says with liberty

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,409
and justice for all he said well the

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,030
system is gamed and it's gamed in a way

33
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,010
that there's liberty and justice only

34
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,479
for some and I want to make the point

35
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,440
that this is basically the same with

36
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,349
blockchain so first to me my name is

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,700
Reiner I'm a computer scientist research

38
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,399
at the rights mom Institute for the

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,499
networked society and I'm also here with

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,909
v the computer professionals for peace

41
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:23,130
and social responsibility we're over

42
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,170
there in the village

43
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,049
and I've been talking about blockchain

44
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,899
for more than two years now and usually

45
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,190
about the assumptions and what problems

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,950
should be solved with this or what

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,450
problems cannot be solved with that if

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,760
this talk is too witty or too cynical

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,640
for you I hope you excuse me as I said

50
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,190
it's supposed to be around so what I'm

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,279
talking about is on an abstract level a

52
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,900
blockchain as an emancipatory and

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,570
autonomy technology which gives power

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,880
back to the users and especially because

55
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,739
it's it's it's supposed to take away the

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,680
intermediaries I think you all know what

57
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,080
that and I'm I'm pretty sure that a lot

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,630
of you have a very critical stance on

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,850
blockchain right now so probably my

60
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,350
conclusion might not be new to you but

61
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,989
what I try to do is to give you a larger

62
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:19,109
reasoning why why this feeling you might

63
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,940
have or why that was why those insights

64
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,640
you have from a technical point of view

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,109
are also valid from you could say maybe

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,420
more social science point of view and I

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,030
will concentrate more on blockchain as

68
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,880
emancipatory and less on the supply

69
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,140
chain management things although we can

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,940
it's only one hour we can move this

71
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,649
topic to the Q&A if you're interested in

72
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,680
that why I think that's not a good idea

73
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,240
so this talk will have three parts first

74
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,940
I want to talk about industrialization

75
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,170
and division of labor then I want to

76
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,090
talk about blockchain and autonomy or

77
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,250
emancipation of the of the end user and

78
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,690
then I will close with some final

79
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,780
thoughts and then we'll have the Q&A

80
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,000
session so first I want to talk about

81
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,770
industrialization and division of labor

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,830
well welcome that's my Trojan now you

83
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,930
have to listen to this all okay so let's

84
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,209
talk about a division of labor well

85
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,600
there has been the hunter-gatherer

86
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:18,480
Society agricultural society let's say

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,370
maybe from 10,000 years ago where people

88
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,590
started staying in one place and you

89
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,590
know the the hunter-gatherer thing

90
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,679
there was no specialization in the way

91
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,049
where that we know it now certainly

92
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,330
there were roles in those societies in

93
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,790
the villages but not in the sense of how

94
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,050
we now in industrial societies we have

95
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,330
like very

96
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,580
cific tasks even maybe broken down to

97
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,530
one part of the screw which is not even

98
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,169
the whole screw to make that for example

99
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,869
so the next step you could say is in

100
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,299
this relation industrialization we would

101
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,220
say maybe you could see the starting

102
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,590
point the middle of the 18th century is

103
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,349
1750 is somehow where some people would

104
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,060
say the start with the steam engine and

105
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,460
such this is usually the tech narrative

106
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,979
but in social science there are also

107
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,250
other voices who say industrialization

108
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,659
actually came about because of mainly a

109
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,460
reorganization of labor to Tarantino our

110
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,199
writers that wrote about this so that

111
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,299
means you could have had

112
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,219
industrialization without changing

113
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,159
technology just because you reorganize

114
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:22,349
and split up labor and then distribute

115
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,210
it to different people so it's you know

116
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:27,750
that's just the other end which would be

117
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,979
a totally non tech narrative well of

118
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,289
course the truth that is somewhere in

119
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,270
between it's usually intertwined people

120
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,770
create technology then technology

121
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,539
creates how people interact with each

122
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,389
other and back and forth so it's it's

123
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:42,659
all it's as usually I think a mix so but

124
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,710
what changed well at first I want to

125
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:48,389
look at the workplace like he somehow

126
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,250
distinguished three dimensions where

127
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,289
work changed first we had

128
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,159
standardization so we could measure

129
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,509
products we could like measure in the

130
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,949
physical sense but also in terms of

131
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:03,270
quality so we can say if we know the

132
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,039
products are standardized then you can

133
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,750
split this up into a chain and then you

134
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,419
can say okay I've replaced this part or

135
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,099
I use another part because the

136
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,349
interfaces are somehow a senator

137
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:16,590
standardized then we have specialization

138
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:19,080
so the creation of products has been

139
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,929
broken up into small and smaller steps

140
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,758
from making the whole shoe into making

141
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,590
the soles and the you know the top part

142
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,949
and the laces and everything so split it

143
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,500
up to specialize and then have maybe

144
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,960
higher quality and then you know and the

145
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,069
third one would be automation so if you

146
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,900
have the specialization in the

147
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,060
standardization you can actually start

148
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,310
letting machines doing part of the work

149
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,180
in the case of the steam engine was the

150
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,430
physical labor that was being replaced

151
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,550
now we could say maybe another like the

152
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,130
the mental label as as being automated

153
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,050
well by the use of computers but this

154
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,930
isn't this is not how it started somehow

155
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,710
so obviously society changed because of

156
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,440
those kind of production methods well

157
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,080
with the specialization the increase in

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,640
a degree of details for each step if

159
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,169
you're Marxian you would say oh this is

160
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,690
the start of the alienation of the

161
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,910
worker so if you're not really you know

162
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,380
building making the shoe and selling it

163
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,700
to people but you're just using the

164
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,990
laces you will never see the happy

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,460
customer buying the shoe with a

166
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,410
beautiful laces so you're somehow

167
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,260
alienated from this the things you do

168
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,010
and not getting any social feedback

169
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,340
somehow

170
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,440
so hence society became more complex

171
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,750
because of course you have to organize

172
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,219
this kind of labour and this kind of you

173
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,680
know have their depart and then you

174
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,530
reunify the parts again you have to so

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,740
so a special new class like the

176
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,270
bureaucrats were created somehow you

177
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,170
know the people with the ties who just

178
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,240
only do the the organization of labor

179
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,550
and in the same way the products and

180
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,470
artifacts also became more complex if

181
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,940
you look at it now even shoes have this

182
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,800
kind of you know the parts where the

183
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,050
airs in and then the other parts where

184
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,080
you know protects you from from rain and

185
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,440
whatever I am not wearing shoes so maybe

186
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:12,510
that's okay

187
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,890
so the alienation started from people

188
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,990
from their products but also people from

189
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,030
each other and people with larger

190
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,400
organizations where people work we don't

191
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,690
even know really where's like who's the

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,099
management and all this so everything

193
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,600
gets more and more complicated because

194
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,600
of splitting up all those steps so

195
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,280
sociality somehow definitely changed

196
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,799
from communities to society what does

197
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,750
that mean well in the community usually

198
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,390
you have individual exchanges between

199
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,240
people who are seen as people so you

200
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,799
have your neighbor is not someone who

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
provides the service to you but it's

202
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,430
your neighbor with their problems with

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,730
you know with the whole personality

204
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,560
somehow so this is somehow how villages

205
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,350
somehow worked and if you look around in

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,790
camp as well you have the villages where

207
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,970
people know each other and with people

208
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,990
it's not really the exchange of products

209
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,019
but there's more like being there

210
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:08,060
together as as a group

211
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:10,170
but society in the opposite is somehow

212
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,449
characterized if you want to follow

213
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,959
tony's on this by the functional

214
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:17,430
exchange so if you go to the bakery

215
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,199
you're actually not that much interested

216
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,939
in you know how the life is going up the

217
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:23,819
person selling you the bread maybe there

218
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,259
might even be just in a machine doing

219
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:27,540
this for you so you're only interested

220
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,509
in the functional service that person

221
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,519
provides to you so that somehow someone

222
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,930
made the shoe and gave it to someone

223
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,459
else and in the end you just go to the

224
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,410
shop here's the money i want to have the

225
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:41,069
shoe so the interaction somehow

226
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,779
dehumanize and get very functional so

227
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:46,920
this is kind of the the switch from

228
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:49,649
community to society as you could say so

229
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,899
that means you're now we have a

230
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:54,449
continuous exposure to encrypt

231
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,240
incomprehensible artifacts they might be

232
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:59,609
technical or not it's the same with if

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,860
you think about as i said you don't even

234
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,060
know maybe I'm maybe usually you don't

235
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,680
even know where your bread comes from

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,790
you know if you go to organic shop and

237
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,529
they show you you know this is the

238
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,980
bakery you can even go there but this is

239
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:13,170
not really how at the moment society

240
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,970
largely works and all this complicated

241
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,180
products if you think about cars

242
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:22,529
computers condoms water socks food in

243
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,810
all of those products we are we're not

244
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,029
experts so we go to shop and we buy

245
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,310
something and somehow we have trust that

246
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:35,670
it will not poison us it will not you

247
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:39,779
know hurt us or anything like that so

248
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:42,089
but also would also came up as a change

249
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,310
is more and more power differences

250
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,829
because not all actors in the society

251
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,199
game are equally powerful of course the

252
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,880
individual if you're in a community you

253
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:52,920
if there's a problem of course you can

254
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,260
somehow deal with a problem or with a

255
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,910
person you have a problem with or

256
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,160
anything and if this if you can't solve

257
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,199
it maybe you go somehow one layer up but

258
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,930
you also know though this person so it's

259
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:05,339
maybe the elderly person in the village

260
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,170
or something but you still know each

261
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,360
other but now with large organizations

262
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,040
if you have a problem well you get to

263
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,839
the customer complaints and they all

264
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,430
think our problems are really important

265
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,050
to them and they will get back to us as

266
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,569
soon as possible you know you don't

267
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,530
really

268
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,630
you don't really know what's happening

269
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,270
you're just interacting with the machine

270
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,600
as if so to say and of course those

271
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:28,750
large corporations might it be BMW or

272
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,660
Facebook they are very very powerful

273
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,140
they define how a Facebook profile looks

274
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,640
like somehow what what you can choose

275
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,069
how to present yourself right we have to

276
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,660
sweat this problem with let's say gender

277
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,100
if facebook says there only two genders

278
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,959
well this is what you can you could

279
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,500
choose in your pulldown menu right you

280
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,570
you can't change what how how how

281
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,820
profile looks like you can maybe fill in

282
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,140
your famous movies or something but

283
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,930
that's that's you know that so there was

284
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,020
structuring of society is completely

285
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,969
taken over by those organizations as

286
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,760
must it's not necessarily bad but I'm

287
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,100
just saying that is the difference so

288
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,530
but how do we deal with the situation of

289
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,310
those power in differences and those

290
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,290
largely not understood systems and and

291
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,119
complex interactions and also the

292
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:20,290
products we don't really understand well

293
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,510
they're basically two two approaches

294
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,400
it's like two extremes on the scale I

295
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,689
would call the first one the libertarian

296
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,670
approach and the second one is the

297
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,100
collectivist approach well the

298
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,410
libertarian approach says I would like

299
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,390
to call it the the warrior mode it's

300
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,900
kind of I have my individual

301
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:40,689
responsibilities and I want to have the

302
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,370
power to live my life as I please and if

303
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,230
I want something a product or something

304
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,060
changed then I have to learn about it

305
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,280
and change it myself that's kind of

306
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,660
maybe in this community it was would be

307
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,040
like okay there's surveillance and

308
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,510
everything so what do you do well you

309
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,240
encrypt your emails this is what you can

310
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,950
do you acquire the knowledge about IT

311
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,170
security our data protection all this

312
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,130
and then you start doing what you do and

313
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,740
this is kind of the the you could say

314
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,300
maybe crypto are not gist view encrypt

315
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,700
your stuff and your friends stuff and

316
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,099
then you try to stay out of society you

317
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,040
somehow try to create an end cloud where

318
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,560
you in your warrior mindset can kind of

319
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,959
fight society because it's not like you

320
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,369
want it to be the other approach is

321
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,010
somehow the I would call the

322
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,930
collectivist approach it's somehow I

323
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,439
would say maybe in computer terms

324
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,520
protected mode so we have some

325
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,410
collective responsibility

326
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,300
that the society is somehow shaped in a

327
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,839
form that not everyone has to be a

328
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,599
warrior all the time so those power

329
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,700
differences have to be somehow counter

330
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,440
balanced what we made up for this is

331
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,360
some kind of the idea or the most

332
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,270
positive idea like a state where you say

333
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,130
okay people pay taxes and then maybe the

334
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,630
the weaker ones of society they get some

335
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,460
kind of support the stronger ones have

336
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,800
to pay more taxes it's an ideal world I

337
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,660
know it doesn't work like that

338
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,750
but that's that somehow that's somehow

339
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,949
the idea so that there's an a collective

340
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:10,050
system in place that somehow balance

341
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,050
balances again those natural imbalances

342
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:19,720
so if we have if we have like those two

343
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:22,360
modes of operation now we can think

344
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,790
about emancipation and autonomy it

345
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,740
somehow autonomy the opposite of

346
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,079
heteronomy which means like to be

347
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,090
controlled by other people but you to

348
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,220
take your life and to take your

349
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,070
decisions into your own hands to be able

350
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:39,700
to do this so you want to live freely

351
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,470
and independent from coercion but even

352
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,410
from sickness somehow right because we

353
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,120
all have different health pre positions

354
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,890
of course there's the part of how we

355
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,510
live our lives but of course there's the

356
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:53,680
part of how we're born and all those

357
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:57,730
things so in the first case well the

358
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,500
first case I mean the liver can if you

359
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,290
want to live free well then you need the

360
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,060
power and the resources and some critics

361
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,030
even say you need the luck you know some

362
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,439
people are born with passports with more

363
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,380
possibilities and other people just have

364
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,150
bad luck with maybe even no passport so

365
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,310
but this is something you have to deal

366
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,350
with yourself right the libertarian

367
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:21,339
approach the second case the the

368
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:24,520
collectivist approach is somehow the

369
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:27,010
group of people the society somehow has

370
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,160
to come up with a solution that the

371
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:33,220
society and the environment should

372
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,339
somehow be prepared to somehow carry the

373
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,120
power the powerless and restrain the

374
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,890
strong ones well some critics say it's

375
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,150
only about raising the powerless but

376
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,779
that doesn't really work because the

377
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,209
means

378
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:49,029
to distribute are somehow limited so if

379
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:50,829
you want to support the powers of course

380
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,660
you have to take power from someone so

381
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:54,579
it's it's you could even say it's a

382
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,079
zero-sum game so if some people say well

383
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,609
the problem is not that there's so many

384
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,099
poor people the problem is that they are

385
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,930
not enough rich people well it will 1/1

386
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,059
amount of money of course you can't make

387
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,459
other people rich without taking money

388
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:11,410
from somewhere you know it doesn't it's

389
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:13,779
connected so just an example for this

390
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,339
kind of the libertarian approach and the

391
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:18,220
collectivist approach if you think of

392
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,499
maybe have the freedom of movement in a

393
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,879
city with a lot of bridges like Berlin

394
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:24,339
for example Berlin has more bridges than

395
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,259
Venice so let's take a boolean so the

396
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,269
libertarian approach what would it be it

397
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,800
would be well you have to repair the

398
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,329
bridges all the time you have to learn

399
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,670
how to swim you maybe you have to buy a

400
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:35,739
boat maybe a big car that you can

401
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,599
actually drive through those areas where

402
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,309
the bridges are broken or maybe you have

403
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,350
strong and important friends who'd

404
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:43,809
somehow arrange things for you

405
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,769
well the collectivist approach would be

406
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:49,509
well we have to make some organization

407
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,059
create organizations whose

408
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,439
responsibility is to take care that

409
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,509
those bridges are in good conditions

410
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:58,569
because not everyone is a bridge maker

411
00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:00,250
right so the main target of this

412
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:03,069
organization is that you can actually

413
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,119
exercise your freedom for Froome for

414
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:08,619
free movement which is based on the

415
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,448
bridges being in a good condition so

416
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,799
that means just to say well you have the

417
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,089
freedom of movement the for next

418
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,918
question should be but what are the

419
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,688
preconditions well if there's a lot of

420
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,429
bridges then the bridges have to be okay

421
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,740
otherwise this freedom will never be

422
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,079
exercised or only be exercised by the

423
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,270
powerful ones right so that's kind of

424
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,599
the libertarian versus collectivist

425
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,600
so now let's talk about blockchain

426
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,600
finally

427
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,850
especially and when I say blockchain I

428
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,470
include smart contracts and the like and

429
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,719
what I will not talk about is permission

430
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,420
or private blockchains because to be

431
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,929
honest I as a computer scientist and

432
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,800
probably as you somehow are as well

433
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,670
permission of private blockchains of

434
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,840
course our bet databases somehow but

435
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,000
really really slow and inefficient

436
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,590
databases because of course if you say

437
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,580
you know we have we want to have a

438
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,580
system where everyone can participate

439
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,740
and then you say ok let's have it

440
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,659
private or permissioned again you have a

441
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,070
power entity that decides who plays the

442
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,410
game or who doesn't so I don't want to

443
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,389
talk about this so I want to talk about

444
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,340
the the public immutable this reputed

445
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,910
ledger that's the real thing this is the

446
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,649
only thing I would consider a blockchain

447
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,600
so the promise here now is with

448
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,790
blockchain we want to have money with

449
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,010
our banks we want to have consensus

450
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,590
without notaries we want to have a world

451
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,690
without intermediaries and we want to

452
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,290
have a society without the need for

453
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,510
trust

454
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,909
if you think back to what I said before

455
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,050
this would be the trust into an

456
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,510
organization that that organization

457
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,559
actually takes care of the bridges we

458
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,809
don't want to have those in-between

459
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:49,899
things we want to have you know the only

460
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:53,080
direct interactions exactly so let's

461
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,120
look for example at Bitcoin and autonomy

462
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,050
for this matter but this can be used for

463
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,149
for a lot of blockchain approaches

464
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,590
somehow but it's basically I would say

465
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,280
there's still the largest maybe you can

466
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:08,590
add a theorem as well application of

467
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,250
this public blockchain which is actually

468
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,899
in use well the idea and now I make this

469
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,420
as a concrete example but as I say you

470
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,880
can make the extra abstract view about

471
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,620
this yourself well the idea is well

472
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,570
people should have their own wallets and

473
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,219
it's decentralized there's no central

474
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,309
entity who can meddle with with the

475
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,990
numbers or anything and the idea is well

476
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,350
mining is done by everyone it's also

477
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,510
decentralized so that means in this if

478
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:38,199
this will work like that of course it's

479
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,929
a good idea because then you this is

480
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,790
this is one approach to somehow decrease

481
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,410
those power imbalances by just saying

482
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,330
there are just no entities who have

483
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,370
power so the system

484
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,779
should somehow reorganize itself because

485
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,539
everything is centralized decentralized

486
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:54,970
and stays like that well but of course

487
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:57,940
if you look at the reality people use

488
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,159
exchanges a lot a lot of you know the

489
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,700
majority of people uses exchanges and

490
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,860
not have their own wallets because it's

491
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,740
easier to trans transfer money and

492
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:12,158
everything but if you look at it also in

493
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,960
somehow daily use it's mainly the IT

494
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,279
experts and the people who know what

495
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,429
they're doing that are having their own

496
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,630
wallets in their computers in their

497
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:22,750
mobile phones but everyone else actually

498
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,580
uses exchanges and the reality with the

499
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,309
mining well it's done by some big

500
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,470
players if you think of bit Maine it's

501
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:33,990
somehow around depending on your on your

502
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:37,029
on the estimations 60% of the hash power

503
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,309
somehow so the mining itself it also

504
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,559
became centralized because of financial

505
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,210
incentives because of other reasons but

506
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:47,500
we have again a centralized system

507
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:50,789
because there was no no like built-in

508
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:54,100
system to keep it decentralized somehow

509
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:56,470
well at least it is still public right

510
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,870
so that was those were kind of the the

511
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,600
promises but why are there those

512
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,629
problems why why do people use exchanges

513
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,168
well obviously not everyone is an IT

514
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,320
expert

515
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:09,610
only those excit expert they can have

516
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,620
wallets because if you have a wallet

517
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,899
what does it mean well you have all your

518
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,760
valuables on your computer you have to

519
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,168
understand when to update you have to

520
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,730
understand how to secure your machine

521
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:22,570
and all those things that are necessary

522
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:29,519
around to actually make use of you being

523
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:32,168
able to control the money yourself and

524
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,830
if we look at the mining for example

525
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:37,450
this is a another point so even even if

526
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,658
there would be a hundred nodes and 19

527
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,519
nodes 100 nodes and the system would be

528
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:44,950
technically decentralized it could be

529
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,799
that 19 nodes belong to one person so at

530
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,620
this point you would have a technically

531
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:52,149
decentralized system but the power

532
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,779
analysis would show you that there is

533
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:57,309
again again there's a power center and

534
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:59,440
this cannot be prevented by the

535
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,639
technology itself of course right so

536
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,100
this is the

537
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,200
so we somehow have a resent relized

538
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:12,250
world already using like the most the

539
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,500
most broadly used a blockchain system I

540
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:22,030
will not go into details but could it be

541
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:24,850
otherwise and so let's pretend it would

542
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,470
be otherwise so people would would have

543
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,719
their own wallets in owen or everything

544
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,870
like that well look at some random cases

545
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,630
so you have an insecure computer your

546
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:38,290
money was stolen well in the old world

547
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,780
in the banking system well if there's

548
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,740
anything happening you know like like

549
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,840
mm-hm

550
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,150
it's not always the case but if some of

551
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,800
the banks go bankrupt there is a system

552
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,960
in place that someone says okay if one

553
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,480
bank goes down it will be supported by

554
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,550
other banks so the individuals usually

555
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,020
that's the ideal world will not use

556
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,320
their money because there are mechanisms

557
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,710
in play in place that support comes from

558
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,929
other ways so it's not it's not about

559
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,730
the individual now having to suffer that

560
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:13,780
some banks went down I know

561
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:15,310
2008 complicated ok so sometimes even if

562
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,500
you have credit card fraud and whatever

563
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,149
usually there are some kind of kind of

564
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,430
insurance this is put in place and maybe

565
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,330
it's a lot of paperwork but at this

566
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:28,180
point somehow you get back what you lost

567
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,949
usually or if you say for example you

568
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,510
have made a drunk transfer I don't know

569
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,900
if it happened to you you're at night

570
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,490
maybe at home you're drunk on ebay and

571
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,700
suddenly you buy some big machine or

572
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,650
something you know or maybe you mistyped

573
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,210
a transfer something like that or you

574
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,280
were forced to do a certain transfer you

575
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,660
know gun gun on your head that's the

576
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,889
most obvious one but maybe there are

577
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,650
other reasons why you were forced to do

578
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,450
this or maybe you order something and

579
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,450
the damaged and the goods delivered are

580
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,240
actually damaged so how do you how do

581
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,710
you like revert a transaction well of

582
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,530
course it's it's mutant mode you can't

583
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,390
revert it somehow so in this case in all

584
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,690
those cases what I just outlined the

585
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,730
money in this example is gone so as I

586
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,690
say again the old intermediaries could

587
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,330
somehow tap into the jurisdiction

588
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,650
system and say okay maybe you were

589
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,590
forced to do that so that's why this

590
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,770
thing has to be reverted and so usually

591
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:24,510
if judicial cases come before court then

592
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:28,440
the whole context will be taken into

593
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:31,350
account if there has been a contract the

594
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,900
contract is an Express of your will so

595
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,699
that means if there's a dispute then

596
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,530
before court this has to be negotiated

597
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,240
was it your will and whatever and

598
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,710
whatever if you have for example smart

599
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,510
contracts what counts is what the

600
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,620
program said it might not have been what

601
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:48,840
you wanted but this is what counts or

602
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,699
maybe you have a pension app engine

603
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,590
smart contract and you get like in I

604
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,390
don't know 50 years or so you get all

605
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,159
your money you saved and everything well

606
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,690
what is what if there's a bug in your

607
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,760
smart contract and I mean we are all

608
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,490
somehow closer or further away from

609
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,320
programming sometimes I wonder why

610
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,820
planes actually work but you know if

611
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,800
there's something if you want to write

612
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:12,620
code that should still be working and

613
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,620
valid in 50 years good luck with that

614
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,100
the same would happen if you say let's

615
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,960
for example insure a car and let's

616
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,760
attach a smart contract so if your cards

617
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,010
damaged then you get to you know you get

618
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,090
your money back automatically well of

619
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,550
course the first thing the insurance

620
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,050
would say is well how do we know that

621
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,310
the car was actually damaged then you

622
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,110
would say well but there were some

623
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,909
sensors and so this has been reported

624
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,409
back into the blockchain and they will

625
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,910
say yeah but are the sensors actually

626
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,250
okay we don't trust you maybe it was

627
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,200
yourself so maybe can you add some more

628
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,060
camera proof there was not yourself

629
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,280
hitting the car you know and suddenly

630
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,540
you see it's not about oh there's a

631
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,610
damage and that's why I get the money

632
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,440
back it's about what happened who did

633
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,990
the damage for how what's the whole

634
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,360
context of it was it really an insurance

635
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,980
case or is it the case of fraud but this

636
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,139
is nothing in the scope of a blockchain

637
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:08,610
that just saves what is so in all those

638
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:13,560
aspects what's up with the autonomy it

639
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:16,500
somehow seems that if you take all this

640
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,240
into your hands and you secure your

641
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,550
computer and you have everything around

642
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,040
it seems like you're pretty busy all day

643
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,139
keeping this system up and running so

644
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,500
it's quite a busy thing to be autonomous

645
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,270
and of course it is

646
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,930
not saying one should not strive for it

647
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,220
I'm just saying we should reflect on the

648
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:37,570
necessary preconditions to actually be

649
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:40,750
autonomous so I would say I would say

650
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,879
how free and self-determined can a

651
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,280
person be if you're constantly thinking

652
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,110
about not being poisoned not losing your

653
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,670
money not being hacked not being you

654
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,600
know killed and whatever all those

655
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:54,730
things well it seems like quite a lot of

656
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,240
regulation and intermediaries have to be

657
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:00,730
around for us actually to be free and

658
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,980
autonomous and that's a pretty pretty

659
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,540
interesting thing if you take the

660
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,700
blockchain approach which says well

661
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,250
let's get rid of everything around and

662
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,390
then you can finally be free and now it

663
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,370
seems like and of course I'm

664
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,140
exaggerating a little bit now it seems

665
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,060
like all this regulation and we can

666
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,700
certainly discuss about this is actually

667
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,080
a precondition for being free and we're

668
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,500
suddenly it's certainly the other way

669
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,030
around

670
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,370
then we're not talking about the

671
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,080
individual that tries to be free all the

672
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,300
time but suddenly we're talking about

673
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,040
bigger structures creating the

674
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,810
preconditions and we can do this in a

675
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,580
democratic way and whatever we want to

676
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,770
do this but this is about societal

677
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,030
negotiation not about coding and not

678
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,280
about hacking and not about Atty

679
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:43,870
security it plays a role but this is not

680
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,570
the starting point and again I mentioned

681
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,689
the examples think of condoms right if

682
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,919
if you would have this kind of your your

683
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,860
responsibility for everything around you

684
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,050
well right now you go to a shop you get

685
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,120
you get those and you're pretty sure

686
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,070
well according to all we know you have a

687
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,169
certain percentage the things work well

688
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,850
but in this kind of blockchain thinking

689
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,110
you would say well there's a shelf and

690
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,969
you have all kinds of and it's written

691
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,679
on there you know this is kind of sixty

692
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,150
percent safe but it's cheaper this kind

693
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,160
of 90 percent but this is a little bit

694
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,660
more expensive and suddenly you see wow

695
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,990
now suddenly you have to be a latex

696
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,880
expert and a rubber expert to see which

697
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,530
one you should actually choose well and

698
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,730
if you don't have such a big income well

699
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,860
bad for you then you have to buy the

700
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,630
cheaper ones right so suddenly you in

701
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,490
all those aspects you see how the

702
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,760
environments somehow shapes how free you

703
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:33,100
can actually be mmm and it's the same

704
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,570
with food with brakes with water you

705
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,129
know it's the same with car and brakes

706
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,320
I'm also not shaking my brakes all the

707
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,320
time because there is there is a system

708
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,909
in place that somehow says if your brake

709
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,620
do not meet this minimal standard you

710
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,840
should not go to the road and this is

711
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,610
not about myself because I can be sure

712
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,020
that all the cars around me also had

713
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,179
this check you know maybe you don't

714
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,800
trust the drivers but if you're honest

715
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,720
to yourself you trust the drivers if

716
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,389
you're on the motorway or even if you're

717
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,070
on the bus if you would think things

718
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,800
will gon go wrong regularly you would

719
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,470
not take the bus so you have this kind

720
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,600
of trust all the time everywhere and now

721
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,060
I find it pretty interesting to say well

722
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,129
let's use some let's apply some kind of

723
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,500
technologies that says well let's get

724
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,150
rid of all the trust if you look around

725
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,060
you and maybe today what you will do all

726
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,070
day just make this example to say what

727
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:25,139
would I now do if I would not trust

728
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:26,909
those people around me how how much

729
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,610
effort it would be all the time to

730
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,620
secure everything and this this would be

731
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:35,639
I would consider this a very unfree

732
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:38,310
world so what I'm just saying and this

733
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,840
is kind of maybe the the extreme thesis

734
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,700
here we can discuss later on without

735
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,040
those safeguards autonomy is not

736
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,800
possible at all and it's not possible in

737
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:51,840
any meaningful way at least not for the

738
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:54,180
majority of people so that means those

739
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,340
blockchain individualization efforts are

740
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,610
actually working against the autonomy of

741
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,800
everyone who's not an IT expert and this

742
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:05,879
is this is a pretty pretty dim vision if

743
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,980
you think about it so that means those

744
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,110
who don't happen to have IT as their

745
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,060
hobby or their profession well you

746
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,860
better not be old or weak or busy you

747
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,149
have other strengths or anything to

748
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,159
guard your values and live your life

749
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,790
right that's kind of thing so what I'm

750
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,600
saying

751
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:27,470
somehow or feces I'm putting out here is

752
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,570
somehow those kind of individualization

753
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:33,240
efforts of the blockchain are actually

754
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:36,389
somehow a rollback into medieval times

755
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,340
where the most the things you think

756
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,530
about the most is how to secure yourself

757
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,699
and how to be in this kind of warrior

758
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:48,300
defending yourself mode all the time and

759
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,820
to make it more more like more

760
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,290
imaginative you could say this is kind

761
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,090
of hiding your own money under your

762
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,500
pillow and then thinking ok how

763
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,199
why should I hide that people don't find

764
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,470
it and I would just say this is neither

765
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,059
freedom nor autonomy so now we finally

766
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:06,929
understand why what makes total sense

767
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:08,940
for people to use exchanges because if

768
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,010
their computer gets hacked well okay it

769
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,809
depends on did you store your password

770
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,750
and everything but somehow there is

771
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,340
someone taking the job for you to deal

772
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,200
with IT security with all those

773
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,090
measurements to keeping this software up

774
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,169
to date which may be most of the time

775
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,350
they don't but that's a different

776
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:27,720
problem but I think you see you see what

777
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:31,020
I'm saying here it's not that people are

778
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,570
actually lazy to use exchanges it is

779
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,620
just a world that uses division of labor

780
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,809
and what I would say now is that all the

781
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,209
talk of tech people about the autonomy

782
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:45,440
by blockchain can only do this because

783
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:48,929
everything else does not work like that

784
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,850
so everything else creates that much

785
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:52,710
free space so they can walk around and

786
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:55,439
say hey this you know spend your time

787
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:57,240
thinking about IT security which I don't

788
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,250
think this should be a reasonable

789
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,440
expectation for a whole society that

790
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,360
includes everyone so what is blockchain

791
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,460
good for well this is kind of a funny

792
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,610
thing I've been to many blockchain

793
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,510
conferences and it's actually good as a

794
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,639
business case

795
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,830
well you create a product and if you

796
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,779
find a customer well that's good it

797
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,850
doesn't even say if it works if it's a

798
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,770
good solution or anything this was kind

799
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:26,549
of what I would eyes noticed and those

800
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,289
more financially oriented blockchain

801
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,658
conferences if you look at the like the

802
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,309
top five examples for blockchain use it

803
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,020
you could you could solve all of that

804
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,389
with a normal database but block Chinese

805
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,980
and you think so you can sell it and

806
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,539
when I questioned people afterwards in

807
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,710
panels what they said is yeah yeah

808
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,940
that's true I don't I don't care about

809
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,580
the technology if you call it something

810
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,250
else my task is to sell it that's it

811
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,230
the use case is to sell it to transfer

812
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,419
money from the old intermediaries to us

813
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,370
you know that's that's that's the idea

814
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,720
so that means if you find a paying

815
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,639
customer well your succeeded mm-hmm and

816
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,690
maybe you could also say it's some kind

817
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,549
of esoteric thinking where it's

818
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,169
psychologically interesting why people

819
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:07,980
actually want to get rid of those

820
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:09,450
intermediary

821
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,070
and be free so this is more

822
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:14,070
psychologically interesting and I

823
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:16,639
totally understand the need for that but

824
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,330
what what we could say that for example

825
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,679
Bitcoin and this would be my

826
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:24,870
interpretation is not a call for you

827
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,580
having wallets ourselves but it's a call

828
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,500
for the democratization of the banking

829
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:34,290
system and that's a whole whole

830
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:37,110
different thing and if we widen if we

831
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:41,190
like look around what the other use

832
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:43,530
cases they are let's say supply chain

833
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,950
management all those kind of I can prove

834
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:52,559
whatever you know I can prove things to

835
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:55,320
other people usually the examples where

836
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,540
blockchain is being applied to or or is

837
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,389
wanted to be applied to those are

838
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,159
usually the societally hard questions so

839
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,390
if people propose to use blockchain for

840
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,980
something it doesn't say is something

841
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,450
about blockchain it says something about

842
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,340
the person what that person thinks is

843
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,530
the hardest problem so that the magical

844
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,889
blockchain will just save it for them so

845
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,200
as somehow Leon Keizer rephrase did you

846
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,619
could see the blockchain as a Rorschach

847
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,839
test

848
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,429
so you say now we have this nice

849
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,960
technology what do you want to solve

850
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,520
with it and then it's interesting to

851
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,918
hear what those people say to you what

852
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,699
they think their biggest problems are

853
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,350
blockchain will not help but now you

854
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:33,299
maybe understand better what what's

855
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:35,639
wrong in this organization okay and so

856
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,169
just as a as a comment maybe if we're

857
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,590
now we're heading into into the

858
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:42,960
discussion somehow if you want to have

859
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,030
somehow supply chain management and you

860
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,070
say oh let's let's have a proof where

861
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:50,429
everything came from well who puts in

862
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:53,429
the data in those in those block chains

863
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,909
well of course it's the suppliers so the

864
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,520
blockchain

865
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,390
actually just records what they said

866
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,859
would happen

867
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,569
you can still distrust them and say well

868
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:02,040
you wrote wrong information in it what

869
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,400
the blockchain just saves is what they

870
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,190
said so again you see this is this is

871
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,869
not where it actually helps to apply

872
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,270
this because now you just have a very

873
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:17,040
very secure place to save allegations

874
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:20,200
and not truth okay and maybe as the last

875
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,880
example I heard I heard

876
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,660
it's quite interesting if you look at a

877
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,740
lot of situations where a blockchain is

878
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:31,990
actually marketed to work then usually

879
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:34,029
it's somehow the same as if you would

880
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,729
say well we'd like to deconstruct this

881
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,890
house let's drive again against the

882
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:41,770
walls with an SUV and eventually the

883
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,799
building will collapse it works but this

884
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:48,820
is not the technologically best solution

885
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,170
okay so now I think we are ready for QA

886
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,820
and thanks a lot for listening

887
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:59,970
yeah thanks a lot Karina thank you pick

888
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:02,050
applause please yeah

889
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,720
doesn't look like the blockchain will

890
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,480
save us the planet or the climate does

891
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,569
it not really not who I am

892
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:14,170
looks pretty grim okay so we are ready

893
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:17,230
for our Q&A if you have questions I'm

894
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:23,650
coming to you so please wait when I'm

895
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:27,580
here so hi there thanks for the talk and

896
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:30,550
further for the critical points I think

897
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,549
I mean you're absolutely right with with

898
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,820
your analyst and as this in one thing we

899
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:39,280
do need to have these kind of

900
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,070
organization structures social contracts

901
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,850
to safeguard us and in order to be able

902
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:49,300
to really execute our liberties but the

903
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:51,819
point is what blockchain also enables us

904
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,680
is to organize these structures in a

905
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,840
more democratic way so if you say

906
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,600
Bitcoin is the kind of democratization

907
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,900
of the of the banking system in

908
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,210
principle any Dao so a decentralized

909
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:08,590
autonomous organization can be a

910
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:12,370
democratic or transparent implementation

911
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:15,250
of such a social organization social

912
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,930
contract that acts as one of these

913
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,000
safeguards so for example you can build

914
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,730
a decentralized exchange you can like

915
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,460
implement some future key liquid

916
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,800
democracy voting things and and I think

917
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,270
in your talk in this kind of grim

918
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,610
outlook I feel you underestimated the

919
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:36,850
possibilities of ta all OHS I mean

920
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:39,880
they are only starting to get useful for

921
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,319
the everyday user because well mostly

922
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,470
you have to be a tech expert to also

923
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,000
participate but this is actually

924
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,799
changing at the moment right now for

925
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,960
example day before yesterday there was

926
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,400
now fest in Berlin and and people

927
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,860
talking about it so I just wanted to

928
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,720
also give that perspective and I wanted

929
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,810
a few want to ask if you could comment

930
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:02,529
yes sure um yeah that's actually a

931
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:05,290
pretty good point the point here somehow

932
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,690
is first one maybe I expressed in a

933
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,009
wrong way I'm not saying that bitcoin is

934
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,140
the democratization of the banking

935
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,550
system what I said is the Bitcoin in

936
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,350
itself it is a criticism that once we

937
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,600
democratize the banking system we can

938
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,819
get rid of this kind of things again

939
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:26,339
somehow and I think you're right I mean

940
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:28,960
a lot of organizations somehow have

941
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,730
listened to all those criticisms they

942
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,420
are still some diehard fans of this kind

943
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:36,270
of ultra-liberal as the poach but with

944
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,920
the dow i mean i would like to look into

945
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:46,450
into the details of that I mean the last

946
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:48,210
big Dow that failed crazily with you

947
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,129
know with this kind of with those

948
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,750
bankruptcy and taking out the funds the

949
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,000
interesting thing was that was because

950
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,740
of a coding mistake so what what do you

951
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,530
do what kind of safeguards do you have

952
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,629
if your immutability if the things you

953
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,460
wanted to do with the dow was actually

954
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,920
you know rights mom said the computer

955
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,480
will always do what you told him that

956
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,690
but that might not have been what you

957
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,190
had in mind and so this is if you but if

958
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,100
you now say let's create those dowels

959
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:18,940
and they are fully autonomous but there

960
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,310
are ways of to have interrupts and say

961
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,540
okay let's revoke this transaction and

962
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,460
do this again

963
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,070
or you know all those things suddenly

964
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,480
this is not what the blockchain promised

965
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:31,090
right so this is this is something but

966
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I'm I'm I'm happily looking for for

967
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:36,700
other approaches and and what I would

968
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,220
say as an example I would not say you

969
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,290
know get away with this technology if

970
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,509
you for example pay attention to fair

971
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:46,750
coin where they said okay let's first

972
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,690
create the social environment

973
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,970
where within which this kind of

974
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:55,390
blockchain approach could actually work

975
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:59,830
so you have social negotiation about the

976
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:01,420
trends about the the trading ratio you

977
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,060
don't have proof of work but proof

978
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,910
coopera proof of cooperation so those

979
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,140
kind of notes who will be next

980
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:11,290
calculating this is done by social

981
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,089
negotiation so this is something but

982
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:16,750
this is not the pure the pure wisdom

983
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:20,530
anymore and and also this maybe is

984
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:23,170
something I would like to add what I

985
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,790
think what we should not do is to throw

986
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,310
this out the whole window because

987
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,840
somehow many people who do not really

988
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,820
understand what blockchain does and what

989
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,280
I cannot can't do but it seems like a

990
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,859
lot of people now listen and want to

991
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,090
change something so if we know okay that

992
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:38,348
person had blockchain maybe means

993
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,359
digitalization or something with

994
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:42,310
computers well we can also use this wave

995
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:43,750
and just say yeah we apply something and

996
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,220
this is called blockchain but it's not

997
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,540
public immutable ledger but it's a

998
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,730
different thing so this is something we

999
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,160
can use and to somehow get away from

1000
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,710
this pure understanding and then get

1001
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:58,618
towards a solution that does not neglect

1002
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:01,480
that society needs trust but somehow

1003
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:07,900
take this into account as well so this

1004
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:10,720
is yeah I'm also much more optimistic as

1005
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,520
the previous person who who talked

1006
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,098
Thanks

1007
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,830
so about the security problem for

1008
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:20,160
example backing up your key there are

1009
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:23,348
now on a theorem and soon on Bitcoin

1010
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,200
smart contract based wallet where you

1011
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:31,780
don't have to backup keys where you have

1012
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:35,830
recovery schemes so this how did you

1013
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:38,410
told it regulators and stuff in place

1014
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:41,799
they will be over time I hope

1015
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:45,190
implemented in smart contracts and ways

1016
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,859
to also to make them agreeable in a kind

1017
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:51,490
of safe way so I'm still much more

1018
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:53,080
optimistic mmm-hmm okay thanks for the

1019
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:56,589
comment I think that's one thing we have

1020
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,930
to think about if this is being done and

1021
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:00,580
implemented we still I would still ask

1022
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,379
who decides how

1023
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,180
show code should look like what are the

1024
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,370
rules what what does seem to be a good

1025
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,680
solution for revoking or this kind of

1026
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:11,230
recovery scheme I think there's a lot of

1027
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,029
politics involved in there and this is

1028
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:15,250
if this is being done in a democratic

1029
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,900
way I think I would I would also see

1030
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,600
okay maybe there is a way of actually

1031
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,030
improving something but this is exactly

1032
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,970
the complexity that comes back in again

1033
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:28,270
to discuss about code who will be who

1034
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:32,399
has read and write rights to the to the

1035
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:35,860
repositories in stuff like that yeah so

1036
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,840
the the the fact is that you can choose

1037
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,150
what a smart contract you're

1038
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,650
participating to so there are different

1039
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,470
set of conditions and you choose

1040
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:49,540
yourself which one you opt in and you

1041
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:51,730
can try many mm-hmm okay okay then I do

1042
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,500
the direct interaction with the direct

1043
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,570
interaction I think that's a good idea

1044
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,180
but I guess the problem that has to be

1045
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,920
tackled then is how do how do you make

1046
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,200
transparent what are the properties of

1047
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,730
those different schemes so that non IT

1048
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,350
people would actually understand and are

1049
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,290
able to choose the right one for them

1050
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:10,150
that's the classic problem with

1051
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,070
investment or obviously I'm not saying

1052
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,530
it's unsolvable I'm just saying then

1053
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:16,690
this is where the complexity comes back

1054
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,220
in and if there's a good full solution

1055
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,230
for that I wouldn't say it's not

1056
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,910
possible I'm just saying it's much more

1057
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,530
difficult than like throwing out this

1058
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,540
the code and now you can choose and

1059
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,300
that's the solution to choose because

1060
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:31,720
choosing is like transparency you have

1061
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:34,270
to be able to understand what's being

1062
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,189
presented to you and then you can

1063
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,770
actually make a choice it's like it's

1064
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,570
like with those informed consent and

1065
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:42,910
data protection no one's and four is

1066
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,950
really informed about anything and but

1067
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,210
so we we say oh but it's your choice and

1068
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,370
now that you consented we can do

1069
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,310
everything you we wrote in those 160

1070
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:53,920
pages you know this is we have to think

1071
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:59,230
about what choice means and that's this

1072
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,690
yeah as a basic thought for this mmm hey

1073
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:04,480
thanks for your talk I think I disagree

1074
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,340
with most of the points you made also

1075
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,980
shameless plug we will host a debate

1076
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,780
night tomorrow at the 402 payment

1077
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,960
required village which will probably

1078
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:16,900
cover similar topics my question is

1079
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,000
if Bitcoin or systems like Bitcoin

1080
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,089
actually reduced the autonomy or are

1081
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,920
very hard to use how come that more and

1082
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:26,290
more people around the world actually

1083
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,700
massively benefit from that people who

1084
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,220
live in oppressive governments like

1085
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,930
Venezuela Iran China people who just

1086
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,790
want to buy the medicine they need or

1087
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:37,058
normal people who just want to save

1088
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:40,839
mm-hmm yeah that's actually a pretty

1089
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:43,059
good point but if you look at I mean in

1090
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:44,770
Venezuela this cryptocurrency story was

1091
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:46,690
not really successful I mean they didn't

1092
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,880
use their own but okay anyway but the

1093
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:52,660
point is I guess the point is at what I

1094
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,089
would say is this might be a temporary

1095
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:58,270
fix for a totally different problem

1096
00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:00,849
because if you look at this people in

1097
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,920
oppressive regimes of course they spent

1098
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:06,130
the whole day resisting the oppressive

1099
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,540
regime and so Bitcoin like getting into

1100
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,510
this and trying to get medicine I

1101
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:13,990
totally agree with you but if the use

1102
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:16,569
case is that it works in oppressive

1103
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,000
regimes then I would say this is a very

1104
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:20,589
narrow and a very justifiable use case

1105
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,650
but I don't think it's the general

1106
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:25,750
theory of society to say it's it's being

1107
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:27,190
used a lot in oppressive regimes so it

1108
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,640
must be a good thing in a free society

1109
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,890
to use so if this is part of your of

1110
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,598
your fight for freedom then I would

1111
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,180
totally agree and I would also encourage

1112
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,309
people to use it for those reasons

1113
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:45,250
totally yeah well just as a comment for

1114
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:47,109
like ultimately with a blockchain and

1115
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:50,049
with smart context on it you have a way

1116
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:51,190
to transparently kind of enforce a

1117
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,349
social contract

1118
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:56,319
now let's like let's keep parks and

1119
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,270
stuff aside and fail-safes let's say it

1120
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:02,950
is essential in to some extent an

1121
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:05,770
engineering issue then you can use these

1122
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:09,009
block chains to reinforce to enforce

1123
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:11,710
social contract so then that means it's

1124
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:14,020
actually a possibility to go beyond

1125
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,640
oppressive regimes which offer can some

1126
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,349
kind of social conflicts to let's say to

1127
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,558
the citizens or some groups like a

1128
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:22,210
Facebook to their users or whatever and

1129
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:24,819
but this is a way to transparently

1130
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:26,450
enforce it and with the perspective why

1131
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:28,430
everything is focused so much on

1132
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,839
defy decentralized finance well

1133
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:32,118
ultimately we all have to agree that

1134
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:36,828
money is the largest social contract

1135
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:39,920
that we had at F at a moment and so like

1136
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:42,710
just a final example two months ago a

1137
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,770
Dow lounged which is called the DX tau

1138
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:48,140
which basically governs decentralized

1139
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,930
exchange protocol and there well

1140
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:53,359
basically the Dow itself is on chain and

1141
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,730
the Tau itself has the key or the

1142
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,390
possibility to change the parameters of

1143
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:01,220
that contract and these Jepara meet a

1144
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:04,879
change that needs to be like proposed

1145
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:07,819
and on chain people that are part of the

1146
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,349
Dow can then change these parameters

1147
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:11,299
okay now it's the question like the

1148
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:12,650
reputation holders or the people who can

1149
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:14,720
vote how are these voting rights

1150
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:18,650
distributed but this you can also do in

1151
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,689
a kind of meritocratic way by like some

1152
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,849
okay you have some initial set of people

1153
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,180
who somehow got are they in the first

1154
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:28,460
place but they are incentive is to kind

1155
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,500
of like distribute voting power to

1156
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,950
people who actually do things so they're

1157
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:36,710
implementing a meritocracy and so so I

1158
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:39,319
think I think there is possibilities and

1159
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:42,200
I think it's very worthwhile thinking

1160
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:43,910
about these things and and and like

1161
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,000
trying to let your mind

1162
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:49,609
flow flow free and not only taking the

1163
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,069
liberal libertarian perspective I think

1164
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:53,328
for taking the socialist perspective on

1165
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:57,308
blockchain and decentralized

1166
00:47:53,329 --> 00:48:00,920
organizations there's a lot of potential

1167
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:02,720
okay there's one person agree no and it

1168
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,030
was also know way way way that was it

1169
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,779
was also there was also someone with a

1170
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:10,670
question up here front um here you yes

1171
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:15,380
exactly and I want to answer and this um

1172
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:18,380
if the idea is somehow to reflect and

1173
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:22,069
represent the democratic negotiation

1174
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,450
process within the whole system that's

1175
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,799
ya know that that's that's an

1176
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,839
interesting approach and if the all

1177
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:28,430
those criticisms I mentioned are taken

1178
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:31,130
into account I have nothing against that

1179
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:34,970
of course I would say this is this this

1180
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:36,589
is then a good a good way of like trying

1181
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,569
to tackle the problem I'm just saying

1182
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:40,220
all the things I mentioned needs need to

1183
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:44,930
be taken into account and

1184
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:48,649
I would be very curious to see if what I

1185
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:52,339
presented to formalize this and put this

1186
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:55,460
into code if this is more or less

1187
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:58,069
complicated than actually you know

1188
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,730
thinking about society this but I would

1189
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:03,558
leave it open

1190
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:06,859
definitely yeah okay next question thank

1191
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:09,859
you so much for your talk and what I

1192
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:13,250
already thought about it for example to

1193
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:16,098
you at a European Center thanked and

1194
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:19,190
just could bring some euros and so on

1195
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:22,819
and I think this could make the problem

1196
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:26,450
is so examity government changes or

1197
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:30,319
affects embers and someone is elected

1198
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:34,069
that does not care so much about their

1199
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:38,420
and the Mandans on and just prints out

1200
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:41,869
the money and I think that that could be

1201
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:45,380
maybe a pop entity that the whole trust

1202
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:48,829
is or is on the central thing for a

1203
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:51,640
certain currency and and I think that's

1204
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:55,039
a little bit problematic maybe for

1205
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:59,900
future maybe it's okay for now because

1206
00:49:55,039 --> 00:50:03,319
we live in a good society but um how can

1207
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,740
we guarantee that we always have this

1208
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:08,329
good condition in our society because

1209
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,669
things can change

1210
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:12,410
yeah well of course I guess that's the

1211
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:16,369
main problem we can't guarantee that and

1212
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:18,670
that's the point I mean in the same way

1213
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:20,750
that that's why I argued somehow that

1214
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,700
bitcoin is the the call for

1215
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,529
democratization I mean the whole idea of

1216
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:28,029
the modern understanding of a state is

1217
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:30,890
somehow to limit centers of power to

1218
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:33,440
discuss how powerful those entities

1219
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,970
should be to provide their services but

1220
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,190
not more of course we have to discuss

1221
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,770
where exactly this point is but in the

1222
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:43,670
end it doesn't matter if you have a

1223
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:46,160
group of five coders who maintain you

1224
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,569
know the the the Bitcoin code or whether

1225
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,990
you have the central bankers who can

1226
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:52,038
decide on this it's just the same

1227
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:53,450
centralization of power we do not we

1228
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,740
have to prevent somehow that

1229
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:58,879
I agree with you but this is not a

1230
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:01,160
technical thing so I would also agree

1231
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,950
with a lot of criticism your head but I

1232
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,359
would say the conclusion should be a

1233
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,730
different one the conclusion should be

1234
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,500
challenge accepted and also like really

1235
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,540
what you said like with this wave is

1236
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,670
going on there are so many extremely

1237
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,190
important experiments that are running

1238
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:18,380
and if the whole thing explodes on

1239
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:22,550
it but it's all this what we learned and

1240
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:24,619
all also does scientific approaches and

1241
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:26,810
and like the shrapnel if the rocket

1242
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:28,790
explodes let's take the shrapnel and

1243
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,290
let's take all the technology and and

1244
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,970
gather the pieces build something new

1245
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,040
you know like I think there's good

1246
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:37,339
experiments running now so but we should

1247
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:40,609
also be careful it's a sharp tool and

1248
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:42,560
that's also like for for regimes like

1249
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:44,359
they have real problems that's why they

1250
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,070
need the tools now we might have this

1251
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:47,900
problem in the future and that might be

1252
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,589
a tool that is growing that we can use

1253
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,980
later on

1254
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:56,900
you know just yeah ok then as a comment

1255
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,400
to this I would I'm totally happy and

1256
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,440
I'm always amazed with what kind of

1257
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,930
ideas people come up and I usually get

1258
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,359
this kind of ok but let's try and

1259
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:07,970
imagine and let go and all this I get

1260
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:11,690
this in conferences as comments quite a

1261
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:13,640
lot what I'm just saying is maybe start

1262
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,650
a little bit smaller than saying the

1263
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,170
whole society will work like this and

1264
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:20,180
everything will be rearranged just to

1265
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:23,329
take into account that this technology

1266
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,759
comes into an existing world where all

1267
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:27,560
the systems that are there they might

1268
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,869
not be good but they have a history

1269
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,369
there's a reason why a bank works like

1270
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:33,290
that it might not be a good idea but

1271
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:34,579
that was the reaction of previous

1272
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,849
systems and that was a reaction to

1273
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:39,349
previous systems so if you want to

1274
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,970
overhaul the whole system I'm I'm all up

1275
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:42,200
for world revolution you know it's it's

1276
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:45,020
it's a good idea and if it needs

1277
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:49,240
blockchain what I'm in that's fine but

1278
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:52,460
what I'm just saying is um we or like

1279
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,439
the the blockchain scene should not jump

1280
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,859
into those society of discussion and say

1281
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,780
we know better and you know you have

1282
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:03,259
been thinking about political theory for

1283
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,579
the last 200 2000 whatever years and we

1284
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,099
know how these society should be

1285
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:09,259
reshaped and let's have some experiments

1286
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:10,999
you know all this I'm just saying we

1287
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:13,849
should have those experiments but maybe

1288
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:16,009
start a bit smaller than leaving people

1289
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:22,239
on the way who are maybe not that

1290
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:25,719
tech-savvy that as we are okay all right

1291
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,799
this yeah think this pretty much was it

1292
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:30,469
thank you for passing air for your

1293
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:33,559
participation thanks for your questions

1294
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:34,550
and again a big applause for Raina here

1295
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:39,260
on stage

1296
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:39,260
[Applause]

1297
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,319
