bit more demanding with the stuff like

167
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,300
you know let's say being more

168
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,789
specialized and getting better equipment

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,580
and more of it so we are knows getting

170
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,849
our storage right and kind of improving

171
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,099
the driving licenses and trailers and

172
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:08,139
playing every event like we'd wanted of

173
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,539
stuff going in and out eight times it's

174
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,639
a lot of fun basically if I can say one

175
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,560
thing the look injuries here are my

176
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,349
personal heroes you know every day more

177
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,180
so every year more and more so you know

178
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,050
progressing all the stuff we are getting

179
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,009
I think more and more I would say

180
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,780
semi-professional you know you can come

181
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,090
and check we have even a running water

182
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,859
and it's warm you know for washing the

183
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,529
dishes you know there's even a health

184
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,630
service start so you know getting there

185
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,059
slowly and steadily

186
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,909

217
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:11,220
frantisek the next talk up here is Chris

218
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:13,990
Kray with NB to dot are 500 H - Oh G

219
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:18,760
that is excellent so now he said it I

220
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:22,150
don't have to do it so the the title of

221
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,900
my talk is as he said and the subtitle

222
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:32,439
is how to help users choose less pair 2

223
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:34,360
passwords so that might be your first

224
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,760
question what the

225
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,520
it was an article run by the postilion

226
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,560
it's the German Onion News Network and

227
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,439
it was run in mid March of 2014

228
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,660
mid March not first and this is the

229
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,480
article IT experts named it as the

230
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,600
world's best safest password even the

231
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,170
CCC was quoted if you see my to tell him

232
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,460
regards I don't know who is and next

233
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,920
question might be Who am I

234
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,470
my name is Chris I'm a nerd I'm coder I

235
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,810
work for the alert Ted and that's it

236
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,210
what's the other set it's the light

237
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,920
knits fashion sent home I like the

238
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,750
English Tito title better because it

239
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,520
says lighten it's called supercomputing

240
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,020
Center it has the word supercomputing in

241
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,490
it and we're an IT service provider for

242
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,069
universities in Munich and basically

243
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,020
lots of them around Munich that's us

244
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,300
nice building with the supercomputer in

245
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,800
the background that's us very funny

246
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,079
people

247
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,810
that's our fastest supercomputer being

248
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,040
top nine of all the known computers that

249
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,010
have been benchmarked worldwide

250
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,370
currently that's our boss representing

251
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,080
at the last Congress and so you might

252
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,150
what so what

253
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,090
whereas I'm working for the central

254
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,819
identity provider the IDM we have over a

255
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:52,330
quarter of a million users and we can

256
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,640
set about thirty thousand passwords all

257
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,250
the others get synced in from other a

258
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,319
TMS now we're getting somewhere

259
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,390
so of course we have a password policy

260
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,370
for all of these passwords and we have

261
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,610
of course the usual boring stuff which

262
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,880
is use capital and lowercase letters and

263
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,460
we also use pwned

264
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,500
pwned bond started our cell as a typo if

265
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,120
you're really excited piano or pretty

266
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,120
close together and so actually it was

267
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,370
owned so it's owned it means I own you I

268
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,840
have now possession of your computer and

269
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,470
I can't take something from it what

270
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,600
might that be

271
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,700
so owner Jim progress looks like this

272
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,740
you have a cloud and there's data

273
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,570
raining out of the cloud and there's

274
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,640
mrs. giant Allah collecting all the data

275
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,620
she may or may not be responsible for

276
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,990
the data raining out of the cloud in the

277
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,090
first place so there we have a very long

278
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,820
list of passwords on the black and dark

279
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,940
Internet but don't fret we have a hero

280
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,960
in shining armor his name is Troy Hunt

281
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,910
Troy who

282
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,250
he's a security researcher and blogger

283
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,920
he has a funny website it's called edge

284
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:57,040
IBP it that stands for have I have been

285
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,839
poned now we know what that means

286
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
you can check your password online on

287
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,650
his website that seems scary but it's

288
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,810
actually pretty cool and warrants a talk

289
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,150
on its own maybe we see ourselves next

290
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,569
year and you can download the list of

291
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,410
passwords and you say download now let's

292
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,110
not do that

293
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,780
but he said let there be crypto and the

294
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,180
database went poof and through the magic

295
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,490
of sha-1 turns into a very long list

296
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:25,900
that is indeed published on the white

297
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:28,360
internet magic show on sorry no time

298
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,550
please ask your neighbor so then what

299
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,180
then we download the database it's a

300
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,800
very handy ten gigabytes torrent we

301
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,469
unpacked the database into a very

302
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,109
unhandy twenty two gigabytes plaintext

303
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,730
now we'll write a bit of code and we

304
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,720
stick the code into our password

305
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:49,210
workflow and then we kindly inform our

306
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,750
users if their password has been stolen

307
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,340
and we rejected so how might that look

308
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,860
if a user comes up with that password

309
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,500
let us say stupid password and that says

310
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,090
something about the user it says if you

311
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,100
take a stupid password that has been

312
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,050
used by a million other users it has

313
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,300
been stolen ten thousand times already

314
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,240
and because it's stupid you shouldn't be

315
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,579
using that if that is your password then

316
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,680
it's a very clever password and it's

317
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,260
probably your own and you're the only

318
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,599
one using that and at you using it

319
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,430
everywhere and somewhere it has been

320
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,460
stolen and that also says something

321
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:28,510
about the user so in both cases choose a

322
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:33,190
different password and the only question

323
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:35,890
that is left so what about that the most

324
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,890
secure password in the word is that

325
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:44,010
stolen no of course not because it's the

326
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:47,790
most secure password in the world and

327
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,790
that's it thank you

328
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,760
thank you for your talk and the next

329
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,560
stop is going to be about digital analog

330
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,689
TV thank you again for all the

331
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,959
translation angels and subtitling is up

332
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,959
typing sub Society the angels thank you

333
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:28,510
hello ah yeah digital analog TV timer

334
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,870
four years ago we were given this cool

335
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,910
radio batch at camp and this opened the

336
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,260
path to SDR and signal processing for me

337
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,640
and like one year later the scripted

338
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,050
Club was celebrating his birthday and

339
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,630
someone did an art installation with a

340
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,740
bunch of TV's in our hacker space and at

341
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,630
some point I thought how do I get a

342
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,240
picture from my computer onto this TV

343
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,280
and the name of the game is Pelle Pelle

344
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,020
is short for face alternating line these

345
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,020
are some specs like the resolution the

346
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,460
framerate peles interlaced which makes

347
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,110
the frame rate effectively only 25

348
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,720
frames per second there are some

349
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,940
frequency bands we can use and there's a

350
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,870
chrome or subcarrier what this is I will

351
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,720
tell you later

352
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,080
basically Perl you could say is a way or

353
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,680
in standard of analog encode ation or

354
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,870
another encoding for video information

355
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,180
Perl comes out of this cable this cable

356
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,290
is very closely related to this cable

357
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,540
this you may know from your video

358
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,880
consoles and the difference between this

359
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,770
cable and this cable is that the signal

360
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,689
on the white cable is modulated which

361
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:36,560
means that it's just multiplied with the

362
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,450
carrier frequency so how does it get

363
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,489
does a picture get onto the TV screen

364
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,290
and every old TV screen is a so-called

365
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,610
cathode ray tube you have a big long

366
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,589
vacuum tube with a fluorescent screen

367
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,480
and electron beam shooting onto the

368
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,160
screen generating a spot the brightness

369
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,980
of the spot is regulated by the amount

370
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,870
of electrons you shoot so by varying the

371
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,730
current of this electron beam you can

372
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,040
change the brightness and by scanning

373
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,750
the beam across the screen you can make

374
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,630
lines and by doing multiple lines you

375
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,740
can get an image it's called scan lining

376
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:09,170
and it's what all all TVs did so what

377
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,089
our signal has to carry is the

378
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,319
brightness information of the spot this

379
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,589
of course only is for black and white

380
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,079
but we will come to color later also the

381
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,609
signal carries synchronization pulses

382
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,280
you need to know when to start the next

383
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,290
line it's like an VGA but in this case

384
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,329
we dude in bands so there the signal

385
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,379
correct carrying of information and the

386
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,639
signal carrying is a synchronization

387
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,470
share we share the same medium

388
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,410
here's the specifications of how these

389
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,960
simples should look also there's so

390
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,730
called train pulses for horizontal sync

391
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,460
so you also need to know when to start

392
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,500
the next frame so they are special pulse

393
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,730
is telling the TV when to start the next

394
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:53,060
frame here for example is one scanline

395
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,190
or one line of the picture you see on

396
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,510
the top left it shows that it's going

397
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,710
brighter and brighter and brighter from

398
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:03,310
left to right in between to sing pulses

399
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:06,800
okay but how does color get into this

400
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,570
for this we need to do some math as you

401
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,850
may know white is red plus green plus

402
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,439
blue this is because our eyes are built

403
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,230
that way to receive red green and blue

404
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,930
light most are all or all screens are

405
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,970
red green and blue we can change this

406
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:24,110
formula and say why does red my plus

407
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:26,000
blue why does green is white - red plus

408
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,830
blue why do we need that the things we

409
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,210
are already transmitting the white

410
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,919
information we are already receiving the

411
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,510
black and white information and the

412
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,370
thing is that color television is

413
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,620
backwards compatible to black and white

414
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,270
television and they said okay we are

415
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,800
already transmitting white if we also

416
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,660
transmit green and red and blue that's

417
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,550
redundant let's get rid of green only

418
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,060
transmit red and blue and white and

419
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:49,370
calculate green afterwards there's also

420
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,929
some fancy names for that the color

421
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,370
information is called chroma the

422
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,980
brightness information is called luma

423
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,699
and you may have seen these characters

424
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,850
ycbcr or y UV that's the formula names

425
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,370
for these values this is the most

426
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,409
complicated math as I said there's a

427
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,419
color subcarrier and what they do is

428
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,030
they take the chroma information and

429
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,390
they multiplied with a sine wave of that

430
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:17,510
frequency and so what you get in the end

431
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:21,190
is the brightness information mixed in

432
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:24,410
with a color information and to know

433
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,750
let's get that at - no time so what are

434
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,210
the needed steps to transmit radio a to

435
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,590
transmit videos on radio we need to

436
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,150
recess the video we need to come to a

437
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,250
colorspace transformation we do to do

438
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,930
interlacing and modulation first

439
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,700
approach second approach I've no time

440
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,540
for that current approaches to use of

441
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,820
MPEG and GU radio FM peg I have this

442
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,200
call in the beginning we say which five

443
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,879
we want then we say we need

444
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,360
I do because all TV's don't understand

445
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,950
that compression then we say we want to

446
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,678
scale in letterbox our video because

447
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,970
modern videos are 62 9 TVs understand 4

448
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,070
to 3 ratio then we want to interlace

449
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,659
interlacing is explained in the ffmpeg

450
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,580
documentation page what it says is it

451
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,960
takes the odd lines of every odd frame

452
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,269
and the even lines are very even frame

453
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,909
and interlace them together and outputs

454
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:13,789
them here we can say we want raw video

455
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:16,279
and we want y UV pics the format this is

456
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,929
our colorspace transformation here we

457
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,309
say that we won 25 games frames per

458
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:21,980
second or 50 frames per second

459
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:25,010
interlaced and this just pipes it into

460
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,769
our program and we also can double check

461
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:31,460
our image we can write it to a file and

462
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:34,460
import it into GIMP separate it readjust

463
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,279
it and there's our big fat bunny frame

464
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,899
capture he's a great flow graph it looks

465
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,519
more daunting than it actually is and I

466
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:42,289
only show the interesting bits to show

467
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,380
what's happening I use these three frame

468
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:47,840
parts this in the top is the brightness

469
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,789
and then we have the value of the blue

470
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,260
and the value of the red part so in the

471
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,879
beginning we just read it in and we add

472
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,769
some spacing for the synchronization

473
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,130
pulses as I said the synchronization is

474
00:20:54,769 --> 00:21:00,559
done in in signal but then we add some

475
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,350
more padding because it's needed then we

476
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,789
add the things and then we transmit it

477
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,770
out if you want any information please

478
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:14,830
to go to the slides

479
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:16,940

you're interested in the talk and the

487

for entering this talk okay hi I'm Ben

568
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:58,580
Oh where's the clicker does it again so

569
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,830
actually last year I gave a talk at

570
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,129
Christmas about hacking how we see about

571
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,689
eye skills which is was demonstrating

572
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:08,330
how you can use virtual reality

573
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,749
environments if you have lazy eye to

574
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,849
straighten up your eyes and see in 3d

575
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:16,729
and this project has continued and it's

576
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:19,099
become more and more complex and larger

577
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:21,529
and larger and now it's composed of

578
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:25,609
these five sub projects and it's become

579
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:27,919
clear that we need a dedicated lead for

580
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,449
each of these so I'd like to tell you

581
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,279
something about them because perhaps

582
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:35,450
some of those leads are sitting here in

583
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:39,529
the audience the first part is about

584
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:41,960
personal experience to literally see

585
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,940
what is possible with your own eyes

586
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,359
despite what your eye doctor might have

587
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,940
told you so this is a take home app sort

588
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,279
of ten minutes a day of training and by

589
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,080
the end you should be far enough that

590
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,999
you have the vocabulary and the

591
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,879
knowledge to be able to speak to your

592
00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:03,979
doctor on and how can her the second

593
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:07,219
part no words are good but data is

594
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:10,070
better we need to be able to objectively

595
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,139
see what's happening to the eyes so we

596
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,309
can understand which techniques work

597
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:19,459
best for whom and to do this we've

598
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:21,859
created a open source open hardware eye

599
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,090
tracking headset which folds up and fits

600
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,259
inside a Google cardboard

601
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,869
second-generation

602
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:31,309
for a handful of dollars rather than

603
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:33,709
hundreds of dollars so this gives us

604
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,658
access to some really useful information

605
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,129
but it's no good unless we can get it

606
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:39,679
into the hands of lots and lots of

607
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:41,330
people which requires manufacturing and

608
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,460
how can you manufacture something

609
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,320
locally and affordably

610
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,880
well this is my primitive little

611
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,490
prototype gonna set up with a cheap

612
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,279
laser cutter 3d printer and an inkjet

613
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,590
and what I would really like is a

614
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,450
fireproof cabinet with these things

615
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:01,029
stacked vertically and much better

616
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:03,350
automation so that an on trend

617
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:06,620
surprising entrepreneur anywhere in the

618
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:10,158
world can take this blueprint create

619
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:15,709
this from the design and just go to

620
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,270
clone it with demand so at that point

621
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,940
perhaps you're reaching lots and lots

622
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:23,090
and lots of people and this has always

623
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,590
been the end goal feel that is feedback

624
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,510
I'm sorry about that

625
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,809
the end goal has always been to push on

626
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:32,419
the science and to change medical best

627
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:36,260
practice and to do that we want to

628
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:39,559
harness this reproducibility crisis

629
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:43,100
which is rocking science we want to turn

630
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,529
it into our ally with open data which

631
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,408
means that all of the experimental data

632
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:52,010
is openly available and nothing is

633
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:53,870
hidden from view with open source so

634
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,600
that researchers can modify these

635
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,428
frameworks to challenge their hypotheses

636
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,039
to answer their questions but those

637
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,720
changes are stored in the central

638
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,890
repository and don't go anywhere they

639
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,230
persist to make it reproducible so every

640
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,450
single piece of data is tagged with the

641
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:14,690
exact builder created it so researchers

642
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,399
can take the same build experiment with

643
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,240
different cohorts take different cohorts

644
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,459
experiment with the same build and

645
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,880
finally this citizen science aspect

646
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,520
can we get cohorts in the tens of

647
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,620
thousands producing data each day rather

648
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,600
than the current state of the art which

649
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,678
is a couple of dozen people coming to a

650
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,678
lab once every few weeks

651
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,820
so obviously this is quite ambitious and

652
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:49,850
it's going to take quite a lot of money

653
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:54,320
but closer okay I was trying not to make

654
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,370
a sell out yeah we have sources of

655
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,889
ethical funding that we've identified

656
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,418
and we're quite far along but that's

657
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,250
another whole project in its own right

658
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:04,549
so here I'm really looking for somebody

659
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,980
who's an excellent communicator somebody

660
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:08,899
who can deal with individual investors

661
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:15,260
institutional investors and things like

662
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:17,299
crowdfunding so finally this affects a

663
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,950
lot of people around the world there's

664
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,929
about 400 million people out there right

665
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:24,020
now and this is an interesting

666
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,429
opportunity to build an open business

667
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,450
one that's really doing something

668
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:32,000
worthwhile my passion is not building

669
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,399
businesses so if there's anybody out

670
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,929
here who are the proven record in

671
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,158
building businesses and you're not

672
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:38,750
greedy and you want to do something

673
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:41,149
worthwhile I would also love to talk to

interesting talk the next one is mouths

680
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:06,620
Robert see with some de facto Burt 2019

681
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:10,000
international uprising just give me a

682
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,000
minute will start two slides

683
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:32,700
check check one two three check check hi

684
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:36,150
this is something bigger this is

685
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,240
something much bigger than myself and it

686
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:42,720
is completely not about me it is about

687
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:47,010
the international uprising movement of

688
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,460
movement extinction rebellion so the

689
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:53,160
global change the climate change the

690
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,310
global warming has been a known for more

691
00:31:53,160 --> 00:32:02,310
than hundred years there were these

692
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:07,200
scientific papers in 1911 and what is

693
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:10,790
what is different now that Exxon Mobil

694
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:14,640
was engaging in a fake news

695
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:16,590
disinformation campaign ExxonMobil once

696
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,080
upon a time was the most valuable

697
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:22,560
company on the planet and they actively

698
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,230
engaged in the fake news campaign what

699
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,690
is happening now this is completely new

700
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:30,630
it wasn't happening a year ago but the

701
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:35,310
climate change now is so visible that

702
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:37,800
you know Arctic is on fire there is

703
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:41,250
albedo albedo effect that this ice does

704
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,159
not reflect the heat the water absorbs

705
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:47,280
the heat all these models are you know

706
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,880
getting out of out of hands is so many

707
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,129
climate refugees that this is not only

708
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,780
an environmental issue it is a national

709
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,170
security issue that collapse of the

710
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,629
society so you know what do we do with

711
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,710
it because this message is very bleak it

712
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,970
is like hopeless

713
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:09,480
however due to nonviolent direct action

714
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:14,280
by going on the streets by going out

715
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:18,060
there as citizens normal regular people

716
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,879
people who attained this knowledge we

717
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:24,980
can tell the government to tell the

718
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,480
truth so no longer fake news no longer

719
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,330
propaganda and pushing one message or

720
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:34,080
another but hey tell the truth tell what

721
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:35,919
is the situation the second point is to

722
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,220
act now because we need to

723
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,770
now we need to lower down the emissions

724
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,840
and the third point is that this is not

725
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:47,350
a political movement we don't want to

726
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,540
acquire power we just want to get work

727
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:54,129
done so these are the three guiding

728
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:59,850
principles there are also 10 major rules

729
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,850
the I'll just click the clip this is

730
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,350
these rules just make sense they are

731
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:08,940
simple they are easy to understand

732
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:11,949
I can intuitively relate to that and

733
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,200
extinction rebellion is an movement of

734
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:16,839
movements international movement of

735
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:20,199
movements decentralized no leaders

736
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:22,510
everything transparent in public open

737
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,540
source there is so many feedback

738
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:30,179
mechanisms and it originated in the UK

739
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:34,120
so it is happening and this date the

740
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:36,460
seven of the of the October it will be

741
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,918
probably one of the biggest uprisings in

742
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,530
the history of the humanity it happens

743
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:44,469
once in a generation maybe once in a

744
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:48,190
century there was a 4th of July the u.s.

745
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:51,129
declared independence and I think that

746
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:54,730
it is possible that we will protest as

747
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:56,740
long as necessary that we will just go

748
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,680
on the streets we will build this type

749
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:03,009
of camp but not in the you know granny

750
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,950
Eagle Park but we'll go to the major

751
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:08,110
square of London Parliament Square and

752
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:11,319
we will build the camp and we will do

753
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:14,200
this as long as necessary I think that

754
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,050
this is one of the most important dates

755
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,299
in the history of the humanity and there

756
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,550
are a few things that make me think that

757
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,880
this time is different

758
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:27,850
for instance around 70 years ago there

759
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,790
was the nuclear weapons that was a game

760
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:33,009
changer 50 years ago there was an Apollo

761
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:36,160
project the man on the moon that was a

762
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:39,820
game changer around 30 years ago there

763
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,609
the internet it became you know www

764
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:46,690
internet was a game changer ten years

765
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:48,960
ago you know a blockchain the Satoshi

766
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,990
Nakamoto white paper this is a

767
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,770
changer now Elon Musk is flying to Mars

768
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:59,069
and establishing new civilization but

769
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:01,200
until then we have only one planet the

770
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:06,060
things are getting out of control and

771
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:10,319
now us people citizens hackers now we

772
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,859
have the potential to tell the truth act

773
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,800
now and it is completely non-political

774
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:31,319
movement we are here to get the job done

775
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:34,170
thank you next talk is going to be from

776
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,359
mr. Berg about this dream a Linux

777
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:42,720
distribution to research fast packet

778
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:44,549
management hello everyone ok so my name

779
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,259
is Michael Stipe Oberg you can reach out

780
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,270
to me on Twitter if you'd like to

781
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,070
discuss any more of this my observation

782
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,780
is very simple whenever I install a

783
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,820
package in any of the bigger Linux

784
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,440
distributions it takes a really long

785
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,270
time and if you pay attention to this

786
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,550
slide you can see that even for

787
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,589
installing like a couple of kilobytes of

788
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,750
Perl script I need to transfer like a

789
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:06,089
hundred megabytes of data and wait 25

790
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,970
seconds and this comes out at a data

791
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:10,980
rate of just like 3 megabytes per second

792
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,618
and this astonishes me given that my

793
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,780
computer is easily capable of processing

794
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,180
many gigabytes per second so where does

795
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,480
this discrepancy come from and can we do

796
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,310
any better so in the district's

797
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,839
distribution you can install that same

798
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,529
package that you just saw on the slide

799
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:31,080
before in just 0.1 second and even for

800
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,750
larger packages such as the qmu package

801
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,759
which comes in at like 500 megabytes you

802
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,800
can see that the installation rate is a

803
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,540
hundred megabytes per second maxing out

804
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,210
the gigabit link that I was using here

805
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,330
and it takes only 4.5 seconds to install

806
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,950
qmu so how can this distribution be so

807
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,400
much faster than all of the established

808
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:53,250
distributions the first key idea is that

809
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,410
we use images as the package format

810
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,400
instead of archives so instead of having

811
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,410
like a tarball

812
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,470
or a cpio archive or anything like that

813
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,850
we use an image format such as squash FS

814
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,319
or CD images it does

815
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:06,600
really matter as long as you use an

816
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,160
image format the big advantage of using

817
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,080
an image format instead of an archive

818
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,819
format is that you don't need to do any

819
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,410
unpacking so you don't need to first

820
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,570
load something onto your hard disk

821
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,029
verify the signature and then extract it

822
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,070
again you can just immediately mount it

823
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,870
after you have downloaded it and it

824
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,370
turns out that downloading a file from

825
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:25,080
the Internet is a thing that we're

826
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,750
really good at now like we can do it

827
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,000
maxing out even fast links I have in

828
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,130
fact tested this with a hundred gigabit

829
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,200
network card and I can achieve package

830
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:37,770
installation speeds of 12 gigabytes per

831
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,720
second the other interesting side effect

832
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,700
of this is that when you use images for

833
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,799
your packages you can set up a package

834
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,629
build environment such as like change

835
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,510
routes or P builder or whatever else you

836
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,280
have in the established distributions in

837
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,540
merely a fraction of a second and this

838
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,780
takes many seconds in other

839
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,700
distributions further package

840
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,080
installation which just means adding

841
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,120
something to the package store is

842
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,730
actually atomic so you don't need to use

843
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,350
F sync to synchronize disk access to

844
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,500
your local disk you can just restart

845
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:09,630
afterwards and there's no breakage the

846
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,640
second key idea is that we use separate

847
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,160
hierarchies so you can see that each

848
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,430
program is available under a relatively

849
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,109
long path which starts with /ro for

850
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,419
read-only and then it's followed by the

851
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:23,960
full name of the package including the

852
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,310
full version number so that means that

853
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,500
all of the packages that we have

854
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,960
available are Co installable so you

855
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,000
don't have any conflicts at installation

856
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,980
time which also means that we don't need

857
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,470
to do any dependency resolution at

858
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,360
package installation time the rest of

859
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,399
the system is laid out as usual so you

860
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,460
have your slash Etsy 4 config files in

861
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,290
slash mark cache etc etc and then the

862
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,810
last key ID that I want to present here

863
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,610
is exchange directories because it turns

864
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,380
out that programs if you install them

865
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,480
into separate hierarchies they still

866
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,550
need to sometimes exchange data using

867
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,800
well-known paths which with each other

868
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:01,380
two examples for this are the man

869
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,420
program which shows for example the

870
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,690
nginx main page by locating it within

871
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,760
user Sherman or GCC your C compiler

872
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,290
which needs to access the header files

873
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,790
of Lipp USB if you want to link a

874
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,560
program against live USB

875
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,210
the prudent approach that we're taking

876
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,200
here is that were emulating these

877
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,660
well-known paths

878
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,910
so user include JPEG Latour H can be

879
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,009
read just like a normal file but in

880
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,740
reality it is a sibling to the package

881
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,599
store this design decision means that we

882
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,970
are entirely compatible with third-party

883
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,220
software or third-party sources that

884
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,589
have not been yet packaged for district

885
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,660
self so you can just like download your

886
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:39,210
favorite program from the internet be it

887
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,618
Spotify or Chrome or something that you

888
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,619
need to compile yourself and you can

889
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,140
just run it on this tree so about the

890
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,930
project it is meant for distribution

891
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,390
research so the idea is that I'm setting

892
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,460
a bar I'm setting the bar very high like

893
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,259
this is the minimum viable thing that

894
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,869
you can use in order to have a working

895
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,119
Linux computer I'm using this on my

896
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:02,700
laptop for many months now it works just

897
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,680
fine like i can watch netflix i can run

898
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,879
chrome like all of the usual stuff did

899
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,549
you want to do with the computer no

900
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,560
problem whatsoever I'm not looking for

901
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,960
any users or contributors what I want to

902
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,310
do is put a little bit of public

903
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,530
pressure on the existing distribution

904
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,599
package managers and really ask these

905
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,819
maintain is why is it so slow can you

906
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,819
use any of these ideas to make it faster

907
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:25,920
so you're welcome to try it out we have

908
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:28,349
easy instructions for how to run it in

910
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:32,220
and use your computer from a USB stick

911
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,220
for how to run it in VirtualBox you can

912
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,169
run it by a docker or Google cloud

913
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,759
anything goes and if this interests you

914
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,160
at all if you have anything to share

915
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,140
anything to observe any feedback or we

916
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,810
just want to talk I'm very happy to talk

917
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:58,859
to this talk about this at any time so

918

I'm fronting and together with Sonic we

1058
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,170
did a project or we prepared it we did

1059
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,420
automatic run control points for

1060
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,490
photogrammetry so when you have a drone

1061
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,980
and you want to make a photogrammetry 3d

1062
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,308
model of a area you have to deploy

1063
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,789
ground control points to get in to

1064
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:08,950
reference

1065
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:12,460
Swilly model out of it so normally you

1066
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:15,460
deploy Zeus tightly on the ground take a

1067
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:17,380
GPS device and measure the position and

1068
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,019
then you can fly a drone over it and

1069
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,480
take photos and afterwards at the

1070
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:24,519
computer you have to mark these ground

1071
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,789
control points in the picture say this

1072
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:29,828
is control point number five and as this

1073
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:32,380
coordinate and you have to click it in

1074
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:34,839
every picture and then you can let the

1075
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,819
computer computer model let's complicate

1076
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:40,328
the process but it works and then you'll

1077
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:42,819
get a fancy 3d model but we are lazy so

1078
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:47,079
why we have to mark Zeus crank at all

1079
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:49,839
points and computers can also find

1080
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:52,239
things QR codes which I can find them so

1081
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,400
they can find the position inside the

1082
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,349
image and they can also extract

1083
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,349
information out of it so we don't have

1084
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:02,049
to say this is clear code number five if

1085
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:06,039
you computer know that it's a so we have

1086
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:08,380
created this clear code format we use

1087
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:11,499
the highest possible error correction

1088
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,900
within the 25 or 25 pixels and you use

1089
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:16,808
the upper left marker as a reference

1090
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:20,170
point so the middle of this red box is

1091
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:23,339
now our coordinate and we have created a

1092
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:26,950
team to make it really Universal you can

1093
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:29,410
encode and you m ID so you can even pay

1094
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,930
fit in your parking lot a QR code and

1095
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:34,390
say this is position and created in osm

1096
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:36,069
note so our software can identify it you

1097
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,500
can use a local ID that's what we are

1098
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:41,150
using here on the cam so

1099
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,970
placing the QR code for a short amount

1100
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,769
of time and then you can create an table

1101
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:50,058
as a lookup table where the ID and the

1102
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:55,129
coordinators associated and you can also

1103
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:57,079
hard code coordinates so when you have

1104
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,630
this concrete or point this is a plane

1105
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:02,420
that we printed out and it will have

1106
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,160
here you have to deploy these crack

1107
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,200
codes anyway and you have to measure

1108
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,450
their position if you're doing it

1109
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,868
yourself here on the airfield we will do

1110
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:14,000
it for you so you can skip post points

1111
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:15,680
and then you can fly a drone and take

1112
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,260
the photos and then there's the cool

1113
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,808
part you can let the computer finds QR

1114
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,940
code so you say there are images finds

1115
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,609
the QR codes and then you get an table

1116
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,539
for the drone mapping open to an F for

1117
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:32,119
example software to find these QR codes

1118
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:34,519
and then you get in wonderful hopefully

1119
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:38,599
wonderful few events or the photo and

1120
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:40,160
Chile model so we want you to

1121
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:42,619
participate in this if you have a drone

1122
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:47,509
and want to fly here fly over the

1123
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:48,950
airfield it's down go go to the haver

1124
00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:51,740
and then follow the signs to the

1125
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,439
airfield and take photos I will deploy

1126
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,479
these planes we have six QR codes that

1127
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,049
we will play there all right after the

1128
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,960
stock and when you're taking photos or

1129
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:07,190
using software please post them on

1130
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,970
Twitter with a CCC camp map we still

1131
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:12,799
have some things that we have to

1132
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,720
implement in our software so if you want

1133
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:16,670
to code some height and have a look at

1134
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,558
the issue tracker or come around and you

1135
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:20,420
can go together if you're interested in

1136
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,240
any of these topic if you're interested

1137
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:26,779
in drones and imagery in photogrammetry

1138
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:32,240
just also come around and talk you can

1139

1141
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:39,980
came on Twitter also me I have a deck

1142

where I will announce when the clear

1148
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:59,630
coats are laid down and measured out one

1149
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:02,900
last thing maybe I also doing info talk

1150
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:05,720
about high precision GPS that I will

1151
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,010
also use to measure in this QR code so

1152
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,169
if you're interested in high precision

1153
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:20,030
GPS real-time kinematics can also come

1154
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:23,390
around and we up thanks thank you

1155
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:27,020
fronting for roadie crew track for the

1156
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:31,250
next talk unified alpha by Pippen brace

1157
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:33,890
yourself for some heavy formulas this

1158
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:36,370
Pippen around here yeah backgrounds

1159
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,370
mistakes

1160
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:49,440
hello I'm even colos or Pippin and I'm

1161
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,480
one of the GIMP developers this is going

1162
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,950
to be a talk about pixels but it's

1163
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,440
mostly going to be screenshots of my

1164
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:59,730
terminal I want to talk about unified

1165
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,190
alpha unified alpha to explain what it

1166
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:04,200
is it's the combination of straight

1167
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:06,060
alpha and premultiplied alpha these are

1168
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,060
two ways of representing pixels in

1169
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:11,190
images and what people are most used to

1170
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,860
is what is called separate a alpha we

1171
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,900
have a red green blue and then an alpha

1172
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,310
component each of them storing a number

1173
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,780
and each of them are completely separate

1174
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,420
from each other sort of read-only stores

1175
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:24,440
to red and the Alpha is only about all

1176
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:29,640
opaque the pixel is premultiplied alpha

1177
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:32,070
you scale each of the components and by

1178
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:35,040
the alpha so I have two columns there on

1179
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:37,320
the right hand side we have some

1180
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,240
concepts ready to be multiplied the

1181
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,550
reason we want pre multiplied or

1182
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,580
associated alpha is that the mathematics

1183
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,660
for compositing key that is putting two

1184
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:50,040
partially transparent images on top of

1185
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:53,730
each other is a lot simpler with promote

1186
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,800
plaid or associated alpha it becomes

1187
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:59,520
exactly the same math for all of the

1188
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:02,610
components and we can easily do it it's

1189
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,350
in D or on a GPU instead of quite a lot

1190
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:08,150
of computation is like one and a half

1191
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:10,470
times as many arithmetic instructions

1192
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:12,630
conversions between each of these

1193
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,759
representations is traditionally done

1194
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:17,280
this way to go from straight to

1195
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,470
associated he multiplied the red

1196
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,270
component by alpha and for all the

1197
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:25,140
others and for going the other way

1198
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:27,780
around and we get into a problem because

1199
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,190
we were multiplying by alpha and to get

1200
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,260
back the original color component we

1201
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,270
would have to divide body alpha and if

1202
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,710
alpha is 0 you have undefined behavior

1203
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:40,200
and the traditional way to fix this is

1204
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:42,920
to just say that well if it is 0 it was

1205
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,600
probably black which means that

1206
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,380
associated alpha cannot store color

1207
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,150
information for transparent pixels

1208
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,980
here's an illustration of curve what's

1209
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,950
going on if you go from straight alpha

1210
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,990
to

1211
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:59,710
oh back to straight on a top and

1212
00:54:55,990 --> 00:55:02,259
the bottom of this set of values shows

1213
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:03,760
that we just got blackout and there's a

1214
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,470
similar thing going on with government

1215
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,890
soldiers it is too straight to associate

1216
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:13,629
it all of these examples store pure

1217
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:16,000
white as in 255 255 - or 5 or 1 1 1 in

1218
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:19,060
the color components and you see in the

1219
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,890
bottom example ralpherz zero we don't

1220
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:26,200
get back to our original result and this

1221
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,779
is some more information about these

1222
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:34,149
representations associated alpha can

1223
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:36,730
store and emissive information that is

1224
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,859
values where the RGB components are

1225
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:42,359
higher than the Alpha and this is useful

1226
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:45,848
for compositing things like fire or

1227
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:49,810
lightsabers the actual problem we have

1228
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:52,900
here this is a plot of 1 divided by X X

1229
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:56,078
the actual problem is that as they're

1230
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:59,440
approaching 0 1 divided by X approaches

1231
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,869
infinity and in integer positions that

1232
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,099
just means we blow out all of the data

1233
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:07,750
we can store in floating point however

1234
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:09,339
it's a little bit different because the

1235
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:12,609
precision of floating point is actually

1236
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:14,259
really really high close to zero so it

1237
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:20,319
mostly kind of work apart from the

1238
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:22,750
special value of zero and I spent a few

1239
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,460
iterations on how to approach this and

1240
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:27,609
whatever end up doing is saying that

1241
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:30,550
every value that is smaller than a

1242
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:35,200
threshold a treat like the threshold so

1243
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:39,670
there is no zero this is the actual code

1244
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,310
I do for limiting it so if alpha is

1245
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:45,630
bigger than 1 divided by 1 to the power

1246
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:48,220
no 65536

1247
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:50,740
then I just say that well that is the

1248
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:53,709
value of the Alpha here so this is my

1249
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:57,490
computation of straight alpha to

1250
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:59,290
associated unified alpha and it's the

1251
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:01,419
same computation as earlier but a first

1252
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,940
limit the Alpha astoria alpha directly

1253
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,800
as it was and the corresponding

1254
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:09,710
conversion becomes simpler

1255
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:13,460
I just can't divide with abandon because

1256
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:16,910
I know it will never be zero and why

1257
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:20,000
this particular value well if you

1258
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:23,240
multiply by a power of two or divide by

1259
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,570
a power tool in floating-point and the

1260
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:30,129
power is not really really high you only

1261
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:32,480
change the exponent not the significant

1262
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,980
so it means that it is completely

1263
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,020
symmetric to go back and forth between

1264
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:40,760
these two representations and it don't

1265
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:43,850
lose information and in GIMP this means

1266
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,760
things like you can blur an image and

1267
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:50,910
use the auntie erase feature of the

1268
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:57,820
erase tool but it also means

1269
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:59,839
[Applause]

1270
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,960
interrupting what you have to stay in

1271
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:06,080
time here and it is a long session on

1272
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,119
the translation a translation angels are

1273
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:12,880
really sweating in their box there and

1274
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,880
we are very happy to have them here so

1275
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:27,440
angry the the next talk is from the

1276
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:30,910
water let's talk about suffering my name

1277
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:35,320
is Raja and I would like to talk about

1278
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:40,520
suffering where the clicker is this one

1279
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:43,130
so suffering is a bad thing I am sure

1280
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,580
that most of you do not like to suffer

1281
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:52,130
and I'm also sure that you know not like

1282
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:56,049
to see others suffer so suffering is

1283
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:58,820
kind of evil but how do you measure Evo

1284
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,560
that is kind of something that we can

1285
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:03,109
measure it's quite similar to suffering

1286
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:07,070
so I have a riddle for you

1287
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:10,250
how many deaths from nuclear power are

1288
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:13,700
the resulting for every gigawatt hour of

1289
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:19,869
energy and for for some help there is

1290
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:19,868
also the number from coal and gases

1291
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:30,660
okay you don't know yeah but I am going

1292
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:35,490
to tell you so here's the answer it's 40

1293
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:37,710
it's 4,000 less and for comparison there

1294
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:41,189
is a number for hydropower the nuclear

1295
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:43,289
power just happens to be the safest in

1296
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,910
terms of deaths or the lowest in terms

1297
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:48,150
of death okay of course those numbers

1298
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:50,549
might be disputed but like the the

1299
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:54,420
difference is so huge that you cannot

1300
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:56,788
ignore it but what other things cause

1301
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:59,190
suffering so like there is factory

1302
00:59:56,789 --> 01:00:00,779
farming and there's 50 billion million

1303
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:04,279
for those who are not using the American

1304
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:06,869
system 50 billion Americans animals

1305
01:00:04,279 --> 01:00:09,900
killed per year for human consumption

1306
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:11,670
and by what kind of questions can we ask

1307
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,849
did they enjoy their lives what do you

1308
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:17,819
think maybe not how can we actually find

1309
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:20,609
it out or is it even something that we

1310
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:22,339
should worry about there are other

1311
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:24,720
things that we could worry about like

1312
01:00:22,339 --> 01:00:27,509
artificial general intelligence

1313
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:30,240
I wouldn't like for a paperclip

1314
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:32,579
Maximizer to turn all the world into

1315
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,758
paper clips or global warming we had to

1316
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:37,650
talk about this already by weapons

1317
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:40,680
global poverty those are things related

1318
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:43,319
to suffering and this is where effective

1319
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:46,259
altruism comes in those things you have

1320
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:48,019
seen on the previous slides or one of

1321
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:54,269
the things that have been identified as

1322
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:55,558
important for reducing the suffering and

1323
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:58,049
this is what the effective altruism

1324
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,900
tries to evaluate well what kind of

1325
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:04,950
things are worth acting on how to act

1326
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:07,279
them and basically we have the methods

1327
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:10,078
which are rational scientific involved

1328
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:12,180
data-driven which ensures that we are

1329
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:15,480
effective and we want to prevent the

1330
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:20,069
suffering and make the world better so

1331
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:22,710
it means that is altruism and if you do

1332
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:27,869
not like to see others to suffer then

1333
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:28,880
you are also an ultra stern more about

1334
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:34,260
this

1335
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:37,170
the effective altruism website or 80,000

1336
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,390
hours or there's no really centralized

1337
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,950
place to learn about it this is like

1338
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:43,140
more of a loose community of people who

1339
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:46,100
have the similar values and therefore

1340
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:49,560
there is also an EA have words just

1341
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:51,839
lists a lot of local groups there might

1342
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:54,480
be a group in your area there are about

1343
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,460
40 groups in Germany alone there's one

1344
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,160
in Netherlands as far as I know there's

1345
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:02,370
one in Finland and you of course can

1346
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:04,529
talk to me if you are more interested in

1347
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:12,900
a topic I'm usually hanging out around

1348
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:15,330
KS West thank you thank you thank you

1349
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:19,440
very much for your 12 please all

1350
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:22,049
speakers try to hold the microphone just

1351
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,320
like those holdin holdin in your right

1352
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:27,330
hand and this this is about right

1353
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:37,410
distance with your thumb thank you very

1354
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:39,600
much so so the next talk is going to be

1355
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:42,450
about teaching IOT with open hardware in

1356
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:46,290
get up and classroom by Tomas Sandberg

1357
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:49,770
thank you for being here thanks for the

1358
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:52,020
introduction and hi everybody I'm a

1359
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:55,410
software engineer at maker from Zurich

1360
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:57,960
and last year I started teaching IOT

1361
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:00,660
engineering to bachelor students at an

1362
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,930
Applied Science University this talk

1363
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:09,509
describes my teaching set off the slides

1364
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:13,020
are on twitter at tom bank here's our

1365
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:16,680
IOT reference model devices with sensors

1366
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:19,020
and actuators connected to a back-end

1367
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:23,730
allowing allowing physical and virtual

1368
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:26,160
interactions the course is hosted on

1369
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:28,410
github and covers the software aspects

1370
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,870
of IOT systems including firmware

1371
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:32,790
connectivity options transport protocols

1372
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:38,580
data formats

1373
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:41,130
cloud platforms we chose hardware that

1374
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:44,220
is easy to get started available well

1375
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:47,120
documented and open sewers it has a big

1376
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:50,100
online community for google ability and

1377
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:53,640
supports Wi-Fi ble or laura1

1378
01:03:50,100 --> 01:04:02,279
we used Arduino IDE and Payton is still

1379
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:07,259
an option it's an esp8266 no surprise

1380
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:09,210
and an NRF 52 844 ble paws with the

1381
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,030
feather footprint and growth sensors

1382
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:15,210
there's a growth to feather adapter made

1383
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:21,390
by seed and as a gateway we use a

1384
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:23,610
Raspberry Pi 0 0 W to provide starting

1385
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:27,960
points and reduce redundancy I added a

1386
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:30,330
curated wiki so only I can edit it we

1387
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,490
also have a slack which the students

1388
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:39,660
used to ask questions and help each

1389
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:40,290
other for laura1 we use the RFM 95w

1390
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,960
fettering

1391
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:53,100
it needs some hardware tweaks so I made

1392
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:55,980
a little patch PCB still works good it's

1393
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:59,910
available on the wiki and to collect

1394
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:02,010
issues the hardware example code or

1395
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:04,020
slides we use keep up issues that's not

1396
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:06,780
a surprise to developers but for

1397
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:09,830
teachers it might still be new so

1398
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:12,870
students can help fix the slides a

1399
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:15,330
specific issue we had was using the ESP

1400
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:18,480
with the Grove adapter hey turns out you

1401
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:23,759
need to pull up a pin and this can be

1402
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:25,710
done with an additional resistor you've

1403
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,350
seen that the core slides are on github

1404
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:30,180
but what about the hands-on part to

1405
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,049
provide the repo per student per

1406
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:37,399
assignment we use it of the classroom

1407
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:44,420
each instance of the course is same

1408
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:47,420
class and contains assignments we had an

1409
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:49,600
assignment per hands-on exercise and the

1410
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:52,070
group assignment for the final project

1411
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,190
creating an assignment results in an

1412
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:59,740
invitation link this classroom project

1413
01:05:55,190 --> 01:06:04,790
is open source by the way and the URL

1414
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:07,220
can be embedded into the hands-on repo

1415
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:11,140
and instead of clothing or forking the

1416
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,140
repo this link creates a deep copy

1417
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:25,220
advantages that this deep cop is private

1418
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:29,180
and you see that the URL has students

1419
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:38,000
get up name appended so you know who is

1420
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:40,490
who and yet the students work on these

1421
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,180
repos and push their results only a

1422
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:49,279
teacher can see the repos unless they

1423
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:52,069
make it public and sceeto crowns

1424
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,920
unlimited private repos to educators I

1425
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:57,950
use a separate repo per class the setup

1426
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,670
is detailed in our meta repository check

1427
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:02,089
it out

1428
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:10,970
the slides are all linked and that's it

1429
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:14,090
from me thanks for your time stink talk

1430
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:17,180
and all speakers it's quite normal to be

1431
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:19,460
nervous when you're up here it's just

1432
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:25,339
relax it's your time take your time and

1433
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:29,720
the next one is Mario baling it's

1434
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:31,520
talking about Susie AI hello I'm

1435
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,379
actually not Mario bailing my name is

1436
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:36,440
Mike Eccleston we wanted to do this talk

1437
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:39,730
together but now I'm doing it alone so

1438
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:43,190
I'm talking today about the Nerds dream

1439
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:45,410
the nerd dream is talking to a computer

1440
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:47,599
and a computer will not only answer but

1441
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:50,149
maybe also solve a problem for you

1442
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,519
and actually there are now a lot of

1443
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:55,400
devices which do something which looks

1444
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:57,948
similar like this they are commercial

1445
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:01,489
applications and they are meanwhile in

1446
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:03,170
many households but there's no real a

1447
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:04,999
completely open source personal

1448
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:07,819
assistant which can fulfill the same

1449
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:09,558
expectations as these devices so that's

1450
01:08:07,819 --> 01:08:12,199
what I'm talking about today

1451
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:15,559
and because these devices are not only a

1452
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:19,040
nerd stream it's also now going to

1453
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:21,440
saturate the families all over the world

1454
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,380
we should do something about a privacy

1455
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,658
problem if these devices because it

1456
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,578
happens that exactly the Nerds which had

1457
01:08:26,658 --> 01:08:30,679
a stream in the beginning and not

1458
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:33,349
adopting the idea because they want to

1459
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:35,810
have a device which is which is private

1460
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:37,699
and keeps your privacy and doesn't talk

1461
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:41,290
to a cloud so that's what we are doing

1462
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:44,059
and that's what we need to be neaten

1463
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:46,639
privacy respecting assistant framework

1464
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:49,460
so this is not only a chatbot it's a

1465
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:52,190
whole framework of things and with a lot

1466
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:54,589
of people around the board we already

1467
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:57,138
worked about two years on this problem

1468
01:08:54,589 --> 01:09:00,170
the first asia community has helped a

1469
01:08:57,139 --> 01:09:01,969
lot there and a lot of contributions had

1470
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:05,118
been made to the whole to a whole

1471
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:07,569
ecosystem of things which addresses a

1472
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:13,759
very a lot of conversational

1473
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:16,609
applications so the this is such a big

1474
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:18,500
task to do that we want to do to solve

1475
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:20,750
this problem not only with algorithms

1476
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,849
but also with a large community and

1477
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,828
therefore i am addressing you all in

1478
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:27,679
this talk to participate in this

1479
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:28,939
approach and we have some examples where

1480
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,339
this kind of approach was very

1481
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:34,028
successful one of them is the example

1482
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:37,009
with the Wikipedia and the Wikipedia

1483
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:38,960
made it very simple to contribute we

1484
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:42,349
learned also from other kind of open

1485
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,739
source projects and we all bring this

1486
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:48,349
together to prefer this big goal to

1487
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:51,138
create a machine which can also to a

1488
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:53,150
questions and our advantage is that the

1489
01:09:51,139 --> 01:09:55,620
lot of dynamic web pages are now

1490
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:58,589
providing JSON interfaces which

1491
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:00,750
can just take and take information out

1492
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:04,410
of a lot of web pages to make skills out

1493
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:06,390
of it so that's our approach and for

1494
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:07,889
this we need a big ecosystem and the

1495
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:09,540
ecosystem looks like this we have

1496
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:12,420
already a smart speaker based on a

1497
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:16,110
Raspberry Pi and a good microphone but

1498
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:19,650
we also have all these apps an Android

1499
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:22,679
app iOS and also a web chat application

1500
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,750
it's not only able to answer questions

1501
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:29,580
with text but also with pictures audio

1502
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:32,100
video crafts pie charts and so on so

1503
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:34,290
what we did what we did is a big

1504
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:36,300
repository where can put in skills and

1505
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:38,640
we made it easy to make this kid so if

1506
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:40,710
you go to zhu zai you see this

1507
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,650
repository you can learn by example

1508
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:45,930
click on any of these examples and then

1509
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:48,299
you see how the skilling which works so

1510
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:51,390
with the skill language we will be doing

1511
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,830
something similar like wiki code so if

1512
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,860
you want to create a web page in the

1513
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:58,410
past it you had to learn HTML but if the

1514
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:00,420
Wikipedia was easy to make it with wiki

1515
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:02,700
code so our code is the language of

1516
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,590
thought and if you click on that small I

1517
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,220
on the top right corner you get an

1518
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:08,040
explanation

1519
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:11,460
what kind of syntax you should use so

1520
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,530
this is what we want to do and we want

1521
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:15,720
to do it with a big community and we are

1522
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,969
now at a situation where we want to

1523
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,430
reach out to all of you to help to make

1524
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:23,300
a lot of skills so we can compete with

1525
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:25,500
these commercial applications and make

1526
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:28,500
open-source version which is privacy

1527
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:32,100
aware and doesn't get into the privacy

1528
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:34,230
of the people so we have a workshop

1529
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,850
tomorrow at 4 o'clock please come to the

1530
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:39,750
HEC Center where we teach you how to

1531
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:42,660
make skills and please go to Zhu CAI and

1532
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:45,380
just click around it's a fun thing to do

1533
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,380
thank you

1534
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,469
please take the microphone down the two

1535
01:11:50,829 --> 01:12:10,978
true dangers and leave the click area

1536
01:11:52,469 --> 01:12:10,979
the next talk is bad symmetric please

1537
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,849
today's that

1538
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:28,340
hello everyone my name is a home full

1539
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:31,570
tang or HP dang if you want to find me

1540
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,590
online so I'm gonna talk about this

1541
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:37,699
nametag that I'm wearing right now

1542
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:41,270
because it's bad magic so what is that

1543
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:43,280
it basically a USB power LED patch and

1544
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:45,590
you can see you can access it through

1545
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,030
bluetooth but the funny thing is you

1546
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,949
don't need to pair your device to the

1547
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:50,780
phone in order to change the text we

1548
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:53,239
develop an open-source Android

1549
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:55,250
application that allows you not only to

1550
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:57,500
write any text but also add different

1551
01:12:55,250 --> 01:13:05,300
effects and clip ask you you can even

1552
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:08,780
draw on the app so just a little bit

1553
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:11,030
better out of the project we found this

1554
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:13,699
device in the electronic market in

1555
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:15,860
sunjin China if anyone of you have been

1556
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:18,980
there they're all kind of Gerrits that

1557
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:21,980
you can find and the batch came together

1558
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:24,409
with a very simple Android application

1559
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:27,830
and also iOS it looked basically like

1560
01:13:24,409 --> 01:13:30,170
this what you see on the screen it's not

1561
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:31,880
so nice and it also closes their own so

1562
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:33,530
very limited text and effects but you

1563
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:36,500
can do and there's a mix between

1564
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:40,639
different languages our community we

1565
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:42,650
want to do to be you something different

1566
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,790
we want to make a cool app but again the

1567
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:48,860
circuit is not open so some of the

1568
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:52,610
developer in asia tried to look into it

1569
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:55,009
as we we plan to do something new that

1570
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:58,580
can send different messages and send

1571
01:13:55,010 --> 01:14:02,120
different effect to the device and here

1572
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:03,620
come the beauty of open source why we

1573
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,610
try to figure out what is the

1574
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:10,429
communication protocol that allow us to

1575
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:13,989
to talk to the device we foul someone on

1576
01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:19,489
the internet or the hack into the SFU

1577
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:22,159
last year so and so basically he you are

1578
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:25,190
wire share in order to inspect what

1579
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:27,110
going on under the hood and this person

1580
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:29,900
was so kind to publish all his fighting

1581
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:31,820
online I don't know if he here today but

1582
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,230
if gaudiya impartial

1583
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:36,940
if you are here thank you very much for

1584
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:39,919
your work based on this work we develop

1585
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:42,980
the new application that now available

1586
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,920
on Android and also enjoy of course now

1587
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:47,690
you can do all kinds of stuff with this

1588
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,970
batch and at the same time if you want

1589
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:52,669
to add in new effects or want to do

1590
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:55,810
something more with the application you

1591
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:58,790
can do so the coat entirely open-source

1592
01:14:55,810 --> 01:15:01,250
these are the QR code you can scan it

1593
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:04,460
and get the app to your phone and again

1594
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:07,970
this project is developed by the for

1595
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:11,510
Asia community we started the community

1596
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:13,640
in 2009 not so long ago only about 10

1597
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:16,070
years so the whole idea in beginning it

1598
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,500
tried to foster open-source education in

1599
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:23,780
Asia and engage more Asian contributors

1600
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:26,150
to the whole open source ecosystem that

1601
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:28,400
magic is only one of many projects that

1602
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:32,809
we working on you can find the code on

1603
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:34,820
the force Asia github our developers are

1604
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:37,100
actively communicate on the Guiteau

1605
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:43,099
channel they also other give their

1606
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:45,080
channel of different projects so the

1607
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:47,000
thing that I want to emphasize here is

1608
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,760
not only the app that we're so proud of

1609
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,580
it's not the product but the journey how

1610
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,980
we come up with this whole thing and

1611
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:57,380
then how this project allow a lot of

1612
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:59,540
young people to get engaged and work on

1613
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:01,010
open source technologies so we introduce

1614
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,750
this to the school and the daughters of

1615
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:04,730
sidon got excited and want to learn more

1616
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:06,590
okay how they can dry android

1617
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:09,139
application how they can contribute to

1618
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:11,120
the community and this in a way we want

1619
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:14,450
to go so what next now we have the

1620
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:16,430
Android app we're working on the iOS as

1621
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:19,580
well and we want to add more device into

1622
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:22,730
bat magic we are still working on open

1623
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:26,750
up the hardware of this patch entry 8

1624
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:28,849
our own open firmware and hopefully to

1625
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:30,400
be released in the cup the upcoming

1626
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:34,220
months

1627
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:38,240
if you want to learn more about us my

1628
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:41,300
charity mentioned earlier in November in

1629
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:42,889

01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:46,379
and it's about digitalization and cyber

1652
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:46,880
are the two sides of the same coin have

1653
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,969
fun

1654
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:53,459
hello my name is yen's foolish and on

1655
01:17:50,969 --> 01:17:57,059
the internet I'm known as you'll I want

1656
01:17:53,459 --> 01:18:00,688
to talk about European politics and how

1657
01:17:57,059 --> 01:18:02,880
fascinating it is and I've chosen one of

1658
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:06,150
the best quotes I've heard the recent

1659
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,699
months digitalization and cyber are two

1660
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:13,650
sides of the same coin let's examine

1661
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:17,070
this quote a bit more so on July 16th we

1662
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:19,888
got a new president of the EU Commission

1663
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:23,670
was a LOF on a line a German politician

1664
01:18:19,889 --> 01:18:27,469
her former job was the German Minister

1665
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:29,969
of Defense but you might know her from

1666
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:32,249
2009 where she got the nickname of

1667
01:18:29,969 --> 01:18:34,979
censors Allah because she was the only

1668
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:37,469
the first federal politician to

1669
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:41,010
introduce Internet censorship on a

1670
01:18:37,469 --> 01:18:44,670
federal level in Germany it failed

1671
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:47,639
horribly and some of you might have

1672
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:51,329
thought wow this really doesn't this

1673
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:53,249
breaks this breaks it for me I'm now

1674
01:18:51,329 --> 01:18:55,380
doing something political significant

1675
01:18:53,249 --> 01:18:58,349
I'm going to join the pirate party now

1676
01:18:55,380 --> 01:19:01,469
it's 2019 she is still politically

1677
01:18:58,349 --> 01:19:05,570
significant the pirate party not much so

1678
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:07,159
but she is now she has now moved to

1679
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:10,320
Brussels

1680
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:13,379
although yeah she now became the

1681
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:16,409
president of the EU Commission she was

1682
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:18,030
confused about her job earlier she

1683
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:19,799
thought that the Council of the European

1684
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:21,539
Union

1685
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:25,670
nominated her that's what she wrote in

1686
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:28,340
her favor letter to the Armed Forces

1687
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:31,380
even though it was the European Council

1688
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:34,349
that's a totally different institution

1689
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:36,809
now Council of the European Union

1690
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:39,209
European Council many people confuse

1691
01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:42,670
that but most people who confuse that

1692
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:48,190
don't apply for that job so

1693
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:51,460
she had some time to prepare for her job

1694
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:53,860
so she wrote down her agenda a union

1695
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:56,110
that strives for more and published that

1696
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:58,360
and there were lots of interesting

1697
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:01,960
quotes and that paper especially when it

1698
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:05,650
came to the part that was about digital

1699
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,840
politics she said to lead the way on a

1700
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:09,759
next generation hyper scale as we will

1701
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,520
invest in blockchain high-performance

1702
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,620
computing quantum computing Edwards and

1703
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,380
tools to allow data sharing and data

1704
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:19,660
usage yeah blockchain and quantum

1705
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:21,160
computing check but no mention of open

1706
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,889
source open data

1707
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:25,590
she also said in my first 100 days in

1708
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:28,660
office I will put forward legislation

1709
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:30,790
for a coordinated European approach to

1710
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:33,519
the human and ethical implications of

1711
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:36,910
artificial intelligence that's super

1712
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:39,120
ambitious and actually so in February

1713
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:42,519
she wants to have a law presented on

1714
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:45,130
ethical AI but there is no consultation

1715
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:47,980
process even started yet I would say

1716
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:51,040
that's not possible that thing but the

1717
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:53,889
real kicker is this wonderful gem of a

1718
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,080
quote digitalization and cyber are two

1719
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:58,510
sides of the same coin what does that

1720
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:04,420
even mean it sounds like straight out of

1721
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:05,200
a science fiction story cyber what does

1722
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:07,840
it mean

1723
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,849
maybe the french-speaking people in the

1724
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,550
room would say yeah that's because

1725
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:14,020
English is not the best language for

1726
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:17,530
international communication we should

1727
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:20,170
have stuck to French the language of

1728
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:22,120
international diplomacy but it doesn't

1729
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:25,390
really make more sense in French either

1730
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:30,220
the numerous young Elysia cyberspace

1731
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:32,800
so only doofus didn't memy die what does

1732
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:35,200
she actually mean by that it becomes a

1733
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,870
little little little more clearer in the

1734
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,519
German where they talk about

1735
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:41,980
digitalization and computer and network

1736
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:46,060
security are two sides of the same coin

1737
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:47,889
so it is about cyber security so that

1738
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:50,830
kind of cyber we are talking about we're

1739
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:53,770
not talking about cyber I don't know as

1740
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:55,630
a aesthetic movement where you wave

1741
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:59,250
around neon tubes a lot

1742
01:21:55,630 --> 01:22:02,980
we're talking about cyber security and

1743
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:05,440
that phrase struck me as a little odd so

1744
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:08,589
I went searching where does this odd

1745
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:11,919
phrase come from let's ask Google and I

1746
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:14,440
find many results that have something

1747
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,630
with simens comm attached to it actually

1748
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,639
they are seem to be the only ones who

1749
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:20,710
are using that they even had an

1750
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,290
interview why is digitalization in

1751
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:26,170
cybersecurity two sides of the same coin

1752
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:28,180
interview with a Zemon CEO Joe Hayes 'no

1753
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:30,940
of course he didn't prepare to herself

1754
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:33,820
it was written into that document by

1755
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:36,610
someone and it is just an incorrectly

1756
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:38,980
shortened Zeman's slogan digitalization

1757
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:41,349
and cyber are two sides of the same coin

1758
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,759
it's not a mysterious phrase after all

1759
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:51,030
thank you very much that's all I have

1760
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:54,970
thank you very much thank you thank you

1761
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:56,530
thank you thank you for thank you for

1762
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,910
your talk I'm very excited for the next

1763
01:22:56,530 --> 01:23:01,450
talk because I don't know nothing about

1764
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:05,730
it but it's speaker please greet bucha

1765
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:05,730
me who call me for introducing deep

1766
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:14,200
Hamish Baba okay yeah hello it's about

1767
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:18,400
I'm puka me I live in Brussels since

1768
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:20,019
five years now and the talk is about I

1769
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,809
would say the experience at the head

1770
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:25,030
over the last five years being involved

1771
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:29,860
in to EU politics and it's like it's

1772
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:33,099
it's a like like we keep in that space

1773
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:35,820
for a moment longer so what I learned

1774
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,960
over the last five years basically

1775
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:42,969
things that are other connected to what

1776
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:45,130
Jen's already said it's language so we

1777
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:48,100
often like as technicians when you are

1778
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:51,490
when you are involved in policy things

1779
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:54,430
it's very often about the the difference

1780
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:58,030
of meanings in terms let's say for

1781
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:59,740
example if a politician or a social

1782
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:01,840
scientists or political scientist talk

1783
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:04,179
about algorithm but they mean is

1784
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,099
basically yeah like a pseudonym for

1785
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:09,670
autonomy for

1786
01:24:06,099 --> 01:24:12,610
Automation why a technician or the can

1787
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:14,440
engineer and after I've arisen is a

1788
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:19,268
solution so it's a completely different

1789
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:22,750
thing that we are talking about so why

1790
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:27,219
does it matter it matters because policy

1791
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:32,050
is all about expressing ideas and trying

1792
01:24:27,219 --> 01:24:34,690
to change the society for the good and I

1793
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:36,909
what I learned as a good thing in

1794
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:39,299
Brussels is that I have the feeling that

1795
01:24:36,909 --> 01:24:40,598
everybody wants to do the right thing so

1796
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:47,409
yeah

1797
01:24:40,599 --> 01:24:49,480
Brussels what what I learned over the

1798
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:53,259
last five years in terms of influencing

1799
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:55,750
you policy is this on one hand there are

1800
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:58,150
a couple of groups they are tied to

1801
01:24:55,750 --> 01:25:00,880
especially digital rights like no Data

1802
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:04,420
Protection free speech net neutrality

1803
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:08,860
and open knowledge or like free free

1804
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:11,050
knowledge and and there are a couple of

1805
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:14,889
groups that deal with it but when it

1806
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:17,860
comes to the real technical parts or or

1807
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:19,599
more like you know cybersecurity or also

1808
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:23,440
artificial intelligence or other

1809
01:25:19,599 --> 01:25:27,670
discussions that are more that have a

1810
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:29,829
deeper technical approach it's it's very

1811
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:36,519
difficult to actually have a good

1812
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:40,268
conversation and what we want to do is

1813
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:43,599
to get a new organization started called

1814
01:25:40,269 --> 01:25:46,690
deep which stands for digital expertise

1815
01:25:43,599 --> 01:25:51,369
in European politics and what we want to

1816
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:54,428
do is to get technicians closer to the

1817
01:25:51,369 --> 01:25:57,489
brussels bubble to do two things one

1818
01:25:54,429 --> 01:26:01,570
thing is to influence policy before it

1819
01:25:57,489 --> 01:26:03,098
gets you know proposal proposals get

1820
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:07,239
issued by the European Commission's for

1821
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:08,679
being involved into the the phases

1822
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:12,820
before that's all green paper white

1823
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:16,120
papers as well as the consultations and

1824
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:19,790
on the other hand

1825
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:22,370
helping educating policymakers so not so

1826
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:26,120
much politicians because politicians get

1827
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:28,880
elected only for a short amount of time

1828
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:31,220
but the people who actually write all

1829
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,460
the the things so it's basically the

1830
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:38,660
staff of the European Parliament or the

1831
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:42,350
Commission or the council and starting

1832
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:46,450
discussions with them and and helping

1833
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:52,190
them to understand the gist of technical

1834
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:56,690
things in order to influence the policy

1835
01:26:52,190 --> 01:27:00,620
at the end right now so we are we are

1836
01:26:56,690 --> 01:27:03,320
just really in the in the first like

1837
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:08,000
phase of it which is all about money and

1838
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:10,099
how we are how we can actually get that

1839
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,580
together and we are still in between

1840
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:16,130
later or like it's a bit of a discussion

1841
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:18,670
because it's one thing that I also

1842
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:21,500
realized is that on one hand we have

1843
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:23,930
basically American companies in the

1844
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:27,920
industry lobbying

1845
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:29,840
yeah with American industry money on the

1846
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:36,520
other hand we have the civil society

1847
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:41,360
that is basically paid by American

1848
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:42,550
foundations so that has to be it has to

1849
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,500
change

1850
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:47,870
and we are discussing how to actually

1851
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,840
change that which is a longer discussion

1852
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:53,870
that then what what is possible to do

1853
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:57,260
here in five minutes and so I'm at the

1854
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:59,330
about freedom village my name is Pookie

1855
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:02,110
me and I would like to talk to you guys

1856
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:04,400
how to actually fix that in the future

1857
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:08,610
thank you very much

1858
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,610
[Applause]

1859
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:14,530
for coming in now to something

1860
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:18,429
completely different from very

1861
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:28,240
interesting imperative draw the Internet

1862
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:31,570
please come to the stage IKS family ok

1863
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:34,410
thanks right so I'd like to share some

1864
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:39,759
thoughts about drawing the Internet I

1865
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:43,269
basically the last year I asked a very

1866
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:47,160
simple question to get into different

1867
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:49,420
countries and the simple question was

1868
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,430
then I should mention these kids were

1869
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,380
between 6 and 12 so this is in Belgium

1870
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:56,320
to this primary school I gave them one

1871
01:28:53,380 --> 01:29:01,000
similar assignments as I mentioned draw

1872
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:03,070
the internet and I explicitly chose to

1873
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,370
include the words Internet because I

1874
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:08,860
wanted to be inspired I wanted to be

1875
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:13,090
have the future generation our children

1876
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:15,099
to inspire me what are we doing on the

1877
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:18,220
web that we're building right now like

1878
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:20,380
we have this a lot of talk about what is

1879
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,050
the Internet where is it going where it

1880
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:25,240
came from what is the web problem but I

1881
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:27,420
wanted to like project myself into what

1882
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:31,570
did these younger people think about

1883
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:33,850
Internet my name is Driss you can reach

1884
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:36,070
me on these channels I'm part of the

1885
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:38,770
fright cam village and fright camp is a

1886
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:41,590
family friendly hacker camp which we do

1887
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:44,140
in Belgium every two years and this is

1888
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:46,450
very much on that ethos the inspiration

1889
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:48,430
very much came from what I experienced

1890
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:52,929
as a co-organizer of this camp

1891
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:54,550
I did a first collection of drawing so

1892
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:57,100
at a first collection of drawings from

1893
01:29:54,550 --> 01:30:00,730
kids in Belgium that is in winter 2018

1894
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:03,700
and then I traveled to Senegal in

1895
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:05,620
February 2000 19 so pretty recently and

1896
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:08,410
I did the same experiment because I

1897
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:11,800
wanted to know what does it cultural

1898
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:13,690
influence on Internet perception is and

1899
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:19,489
I just want to share a couple of these

1900
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:21,409
results now so this is a very typical

1901
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:24,468
kind of thing that came out a couple of

1902
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:26,989
times this is this reads just like other

1903
01:30:24,469 --> 01:30:31,519
space the Internet is infinite and this

1904
01:30:26,989 --> 01:30:34,968
boy age 12 he made a drawing of planets

1905
01:30:31,519 --> 01:30:38,840
so I found this infinity kind of thing

1906
01:30:34,969 --> 01:30:41,719
is pretty inspiring I believe this is

1907
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:45,380
someone from Senegal and you see like

1908
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:48,110
the level of abstraction is so much

1909
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:51,829
higher the super interesting thing in

1910
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:54,380
Senegal was that kids when you mention

1911
01:30:51,829 --> 01:30:56,719
the word internet the word does not

1912
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:59,059
really exist in their culture but I'll

1913
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,039
get back to that later so the level of

1914
01:30:59,059 --> 01:31:03,050
extraction which just becomes a lot

1915
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:05,449
higher a lot of colors of course you

1916
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:08,960
like the use of color that inspired me

1917
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:13,159
in this drawing and this was interesting

1918
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:16,550
as a result from Belgium like inter

1919
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:19,730
tangled wires it's a someone h7 and and

1920
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:21,949
this is what it's in their mind when the

1921
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:26,209
word internet is mentioned which i think

1922
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:28,969
is cool again h6 you asked him to draw

1923
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:31,179
Internet it's like yeah what was they

1924
01:31:28,969 --> 01:31:33,710
come up with and they tend to draw like

1925
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:35,749
people and connections between people

1926
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:37,579
like you see the curling lines between

1927
01:31:35,749 --> 01:31:39,170
the heads of the people like they're

1928
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:42,170
connected somehow and then it's like a

1929
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:45,789
little heart which i think is super cool

1930
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:47,809
and super fun this was interesting

1931
01:31:45,789 --> 01:31:52,400
inserting all a lot of the kids that

1932
01:31:47,809 --> 01:31:55,489
draw devices like because there is like

1933
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,900
they never in that country never had

1934
01:31:55,489 --> 01:31:59,989
computers or the introduction of

1935
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:02,360
computers of computing as we have it in

1936
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:04,820
Europe for instance so there it's like

1937
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:07,009
mobile is the default they would throw

1938
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:09,219
mobile devices it's phones and tablets

1939
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:12,650
and there's there's like nothing else

1940
01:32:09,219 --> 01:32:14,119
that's their way to access this this way

1941
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:15,499
of connecting and what I liked about

1942
01:32:14,119 --> 01:32:18,889
this drawing where the little dots

1943
01:32:15,499 --> 01:32:20,570
around the the phone or there at the

1944
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:22,880
tablet I think it's a phone that was

1945
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:24,980
drawn here so the little dots for media

1946
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,929
meant like this dislike extends beyond

1947
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:28,339
the device I'm not really sure whether

1948
01:32:26,929 --> 01:32:32,090
that was the intention of the drawing

1949
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:34,130
but that was my interpretation of it

1950
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:36,410
this is a very typical Belgian result

1951
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:39,680
where kids would draw their

1952
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:40,970
interpretation of YouTube or other video

1953
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,310
sharing platforms

1954
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:47,690
I like the spelling of Google here very

1955
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:51,920
Belgian this was again a result from

1956
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:53,750
Senegal I want to jump ahead a bit so

1957
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,910
the first thing that we saw like as a

1958
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:57,980
conclusion what did come out of this

1959
01:32:55,910 --> 01:33:00,290
like the first critical conclusion was

1960
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:03,589
age evolution younger kids would draw

1961
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:06,470
like super out their drawings like it

1962
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:08,960
would be totally crazy stuff really when

1963
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:10,850
as they grow older their bias just gets

1964
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,720
so much more narrow your thinking gets

1965
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:13,610
so much more narrow

1966
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:17,840
they draw for tonight so they draw

1967
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:19,849
YouTube for they draw Google Images so

1968
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,830
there they're like evolving towards that

1969
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:23,720
the last thing is that in Senegal

1970
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:26,330
internet does not exist people talk

1971
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,490
about communication and connecting and

1972
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:30,710
that for me is the core message of this

1973
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:32,660
Internet is something that connects us

1974
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:37,640
and we shouldn't be talking that about

1975
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:46,160
that as something digital per se thank

1976
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:48,410
you so much the next talk is get space

1977
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:51,940
stored or quant recorders for open

1978
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:51,940
source hardware electronics

1979
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:11,469
right hello my name is Casper and I'm

1980
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,450
the creator and main maintainer of kids

1981
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:18,400
Meister org which is a website for

1982
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:26,110
sharing electronics projects click aah

1983
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:30,730
oh did I go too far now okay so

1984
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:32,349
apologies I this is a PDF and this

1985
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:34,330
presentation is supposed to be a website

1986
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:36,190
with videos and that did all of that

1987
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:39,309
didn't work out and it's not completely

1988
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:41,740
updated because I wasn't aware of how it

1989
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:43,900
works at the camp but the way

1990
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:46,570
electronics are made is you have a

1991
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:48,639
printed circuit board and you have parts

1992
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:50,500
that you sold on to printed circuit

1993
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:52,240
board so you have through-hole

1994
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:54,580
components that kind of poke the legs

1995
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:58,030
through and if this was working you'd

1996
01:34:54,580 --> 01:35:00,370
see a nice video of that you have

1997
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:03,340
surface mount devices and if you'd see a

1998
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:08,950
nice picture of that if I'd prepared

1999
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:10,180
better and so surface mount is when the

2000
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:13,330
components sit on top of the board

2001
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:15,520
rather than going through you can the

2002
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:18,190
one of the best ways to do this is to

2003
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,900
get a hacked toaster oven or one of the

2004
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:24,099
cheapest ways to this is hack a toaster

2005
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:27,070
oven and users solder paste and heat up

2006
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:30,370
the board carefully and then your parts

2007
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:32,920
kind of the disorder reflows and your

2008
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:35,380
parts get soldered on if you want to

2009
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:39,130
know more about that check out your

2010
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:40,990
local hack space of course there's loads

2011
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:43,450
of workshops here the camp as well to

2012
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:45,400
learn more about that so the way

2013
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:48,490
electronics is designed it's on one side

2014
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:50,589
you have a schematic layout tool where

2015
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:53,139
you define all the connections that you

2016
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:56,350
want between your components and then

2017
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:59,110
you have the PCB the PCB layout to where

2018
01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:00,820
you then actually route the connections

2019
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:02,500
on a physical model of your board and

2020
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:04,690
loads of people are doing this and

2021
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:07,720
they're sharing free freely online you

2022
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:12,460
can find loads of projects online that

2023
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:14,890
you could try and remake this this is

2024
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:16,590
just a kind of informal survey that I've

2025
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:19,530
that I've done

2026
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:21,060
of projects and of course they're more

2027
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:24,290
and more projects are going up and

2028
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:29,639
there's other sources for these as well

2029
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:31,199
the problem with it is that often you

2030
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:32,849
when you come across the project it's

2031
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:35,009
kind of hard to get to that point that

2032
01:36:32,849 --> 01:36:38,909
you want to get to of having the parts

2033
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:40,500
and having the board so it's kind of the

2034
01:36:38,909 --> 01:36:42,179
they all wanna have different structures

2035
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:44,580
and different some of them are more like

2036
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:48,179
blogs some of them are file repositories

2037
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:52,139
and it's hard to find your way around to

2038
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:55,770
get to the point so that what you really

2039
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:57,540
would like to do is go from there and

2040
01:36:55,770 --> 01:37:00,810
you want the board and you want the

2041
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:05,070
parts so this is what I've been trying

2042
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:07,409
to do with these projects one part is

2043
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:09,179
kids based on org it's a project sharing

2044
01:37:07,409 --> 01:37:10,949
website but even earlier than that I

2045
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:14,099
started what I started with was a

2046
01:37:10,949 --> 01:37:16,949
browser extension that helps you buy

2047
01:37:14,099 --> 01:37:22,650
parts so it quickly it automates parts

2048
01:37:16,949 --> 01:37:24,719
purchasing for you so it can automate

2049
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:28,699
the typical kind of component

2050
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:32,460
distributors like digi-key Mauser RS and

2051
01:37:28,699 --> 01:37:34,199
it does this by by replicating the web

2052
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:36,449
requests that you would if you were

2053
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:38,669
clicking around the site those sites

2054
01:37:36,449 --> 01:37:41,190
yourself the browser extension does that

2055
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:42,810
for you so you can have a list of

2056
01:37:41,190 --> 01:37:44,879
components and you put it into the

2057
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:47,610
browser extension and it puts it into

2058
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,840
your shopping cart there's a video of

2059
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:51,239
that which is not going to work

2060
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,489
unfortunately it's available for Chrome

2061
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:55,440
or Firefox you can just use it without

2062
01:37:53,489 --> 01:37:58,919
kids pasted or by yourself with a

2063
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:03,299
spreadsheet and you can load other bills

2064
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:04,949
of materials online somewhere as well so

2065
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,599
the other part to this is of course you

2066
01:38:04,949 --> 01:38:08,909
want the board and you want to make a

2067
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:12,030
complete project so that's what kids mr.

2068
01:38:08,909 --> 01:38:14,759
Roark is for kids base presents the

2069
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:17,309
whole project together with the boards

2070
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:19,170
and they readme and a detailed bill of

2071
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:20,790
materials and buttons on there where you

2072
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:23,460
can just click and it hooks up to the

2073
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:26,580
extension and you can then get all the

2074
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:28,349
parts for someone's project the way you

2075
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:29,910
add a project on Kidspace currently is

2076
01:38:28,349 --> 01:38:31,980
you set up your own get

2077
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:35,280
through somewhere github ok lab or your

2078
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:37,919
own server and then you you submit pull

2079
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:42,679
requests to the kids based project and

2080
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:44,960
say you want to add yours and you then

2081
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:48,570
it gets at it

2082
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:51,720
so the idea really is to have this this

2083
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:53,639
this virtual kit so the creators can

2084
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,500
make the design and put it up online and

2085
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:59,130
you can buy independently independently

2086
01:38:55,500 --> 01:39:00,930
yourself so there are a few interesting

2087
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:04,920
projects that I would love to have time

2088
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:06,800
to talk about too because but I don't so

2089
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:13,020
come find me around campus

2090
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:16,179
[Applause]

2091
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:16,960
yeah thank you very much we're going to

2092
01:39:16,179 --> 01:39:18,820
our next talk

2093
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:22,199
it's called Android privacy it's not a

2094
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:22,199
luxury please

2095
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:27,010
hi I'm crystal Weatherhead I work for

2096
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,810
our previous international I thought you

2097
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:31,090
might like this talk so a little bit of

2098
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:33,610
a preview of some ongoing research we're

2099
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:35,830
currently doing when I kind of need your

2100
01:39:33,610 --> 01:39:37,960
help with it so I'll come to that in the

2101
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:40,360
end and yeah I just had to give a little

2102
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:43,179
bit an introduction so we're doing some

2103
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:45,639
work on pre-installed Android apps and

2104
01:39:43,179 --> 01:39:48,130
this the general like privacy problems

2105
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:51,429
with them this is based on some recent

2106
01:39:48,130 --> 01:39:55,449
research by a group of academics who did

2107
01:39:51,429 --> 01:40:00,239
a he looked who looked and analyzed the

2108
01:39:55,449 --> 01:40:03,940
domain and did an analysis on 1,000 over

2109
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:06,790
1,700 devices from 200 different vendors

2110
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:09,190
and found only 9% of the apps they're

2111
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:11,250
pre-installed on those devices appear in

2112
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:13,750
the Play Store or the Google Play Store

2113
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:18,160
which makes this domain really hard to

2114
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:20,110
analyze so we're trying to get some like

2115
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,429
case studies and some stories about this

2116
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:24,849
so we can put pressure on Google because

2117
01:40:21,429 --> 01:40:27,070
this area needs better regulation from

2118
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:31,000
what is essentially the Google the

2119
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:33,460
gatekeeper and our interest is that

2120
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,699
these apps are often installed on

2121
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:38,410
low-end low-cost phones and and this

2122
01:40:36,699 --> 01:40:41,739
disproportionately affects people who

2123
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:43,929
have those devices so what are the

2124
01:40:41,739 --> 01:40:47,080
problems with this well the first ones

2125
01:40:43,929 --> 01:40:49,750
around consent pre-installed apps are as

2126
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:51,640
I think they say they're pre-installed

2127
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:54,489
so they often come with things like

2128
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:56,110
custom permissions some of those custom

2129
01:40:54,489 --> 01:41:00,718
permissions can bypass androids own

2130
01:40:56,110 --> 01:41:02,589
security policy the because they're

2131
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:05,140
pre-installed often these permissions

2132
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:06,730
are pre accepted so they can access

2133
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:10,710
things like the microphone camera and

2134
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:13,239
location without prompting the user and

2135
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:15,190
some of these custom permissions are

2136
01:41:13,239 --> 01:41:18,730
particularly nefarious in that they can

2137
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:21,129
do things like access text messages read

2138
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:23,438
other applications information

2139
01:41:21,129 --> 01:41:27,039
and also they can initiate calls and

2140
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:29,289
receive calls which is a bit of

2141
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:32,499
problematic there's also a lack of

2142
01:41:29,289 --> 01:41:35,108
control for the end user these are often

2143
01:41:32,499 --> 01:41:37,030
can't delete these apps they run in the

2144
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:41,739
background and especially in low-cost

2145
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:43,659
contexts where the the cost of data is

2146
01:41:41,739 --> 01:41:46,409
high you know these could be secretly

2147
01:41:43,659 --> 01:41:48,518
like working the background sucking data

2148
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:50,978
and that data could be going to all

2149
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:52,389
sorts of third parties I mean it's

2150
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:55,539
really hard to know where that data is

2151
01:41:52,389 --> 01:41:58,209
going and also unless of a privacy point

2152
01:41:55,539 --> 01:42:01,749
but on just a general nice miss point

2153
01:41:58,209 --> 01:42:03,909
these devices often these apps are using

2154
01:42:01,749 --> 01:42:06,760
our space on a device that usually has

2155
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:08,289
very limited space and finally for my

2156
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,729
even off from our own analysis of

2157
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:15,249
security practices they're usually

2158
01:42:09,729 --> 01:42:17,199
woeful they can have things like sending

2159
01:42:15,249 --> 01:42:19,959
personal information I've run encrypted

2160
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:23,799
channels so sending things like personal

2161
01:42:19,959 --> 01:42:25,539
information names and details along with

2162
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:29,379
things like the IMEI of the phone over

2163
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:30,699
HTTP that's always nice and some of the

2164
01:42:29,379 --> 01:42:34,090
apps we've even had a look at have

2165
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:36,789
vulnerabilities arbitrary code execution

2166
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:38,439
and this is this is really bad and when

2167
01:42:36,789 --> 01:42:40,898
it comes to pre-installed apps because

2168
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:42,760
of the some of them have these

2169
01:42:40,899 --> 01:42:44,919
permissions that are outside of the

2170
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:49,329
Android security model so once you're in

2171
01:42:44,919 --> 01:42:51,429
you're pawning basically so oh and

2172
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:52,478
finally on the security side obviously

2173
01:42:51,429 --> 01:42:55,419
some of these phones are still being

2174
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:57,550
sold as new with Android 4.2.2 or

2175
01:42:55,419 --> 01:43:00,489
Android 5 which has got my own critical

2176
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:02,199
vulnerabilities in it so what are our

2177
01:43:00,489 --> 01:43:05,619
solution well which one foot pressure on

2178
01:43:02,199 --> 01:43:08,129
Google particularly to to put more said

2179
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:10,419
to better certify these are these

2180
01:43:08,129 --> 01:43:11,649
manufacturers devices because they have

2181
01:43:10,419 --> 01:43:16,539
such a controlling influence in the

2182
01:43:11,649 --> 01:43:18,729
ecosystem we like Google to be clearer

2183
01:43:16,539 --> 01:43:19,780
as to what a certified partner has -

2184
01:43:18,729 --> 01:43:23,800
what thresholds they have to actually

2185
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:26,709
cross to get their app certified and

2186
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:28,449
pre-installed on a phone and then also

2187
01:43:26,709 --> 01:43:30,539
they should they should not they should

2188
01:43:28,449 --> 01:43:33,369
not authorize phones that have

2189
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:35,050
permissions which avoids the Android

2190
01:43:33,369 --> 01:43:37,269
security model

2191
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:38,740
from a deletion perspective user should

2192
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:42,430
be able to leave their apps that seems

2193
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:47,290
pretty sensible and this goes on from

2194
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:49,600
from c35 c3 talk which relies on a safer

2195
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:52,960
topic about Facebook we'd also like to

2196
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:55,840
see Google implement a centralized

2197
01:43:52,960 --> 01:44:02,380
privacy hub where you can control not

2198
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:05,020
just your app permissions in your brew

2199
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:07,810
so your advertising data and that kind

2200
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:09,670
of stuff so you can ban trackers or you

2201
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:12,060
can globally banned things from

2202
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:14,140
accessing your camera that kind of stuff

2203
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:16,810
if you're interested in this and you'd

2204
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:20,980
like to help out please contact me those

2205
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:29,080
are my contact details yeah thank you

2206
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:32,769
very much and put your please use the

2207
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:37,059
clicker thank you so much so the next

2208
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:47,790
speaker up here is any key but open ask

2209
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:50,830
out making 3d objects by code thank you

2210
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:51,670
hello everyone and I hope you're all

2211
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:53,800
enjoying camp

2212
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:56,080
my name is Anna key I'm a self-taught

2213
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,720
maker and I think I got 10 years ago my

2214
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:00,670
first 3d printer the cupcake CNC machine

2215
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:02,410
and since then I've been involved in the

2216
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:03,940
three pre 3d printing scene and that

2217
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:05,230
kind of stuff and one thing that

2218
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:07,450
actually have always amazed me is and

2219
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:08,889
how many people have 3d printers and I

2220
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:10,540
if I asked them hey what do you make

2221
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:12,340
with it or what do you design with it

2222
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:14,950
they don't they just print other

2223
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:16,690
people's stuff and then I asked them why

2224
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:17,950
most people don't know how to draw at

2225
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:20,169
least not electronically and that kind

2226
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:21,700
of stuff neither do i but I do know how

2227
01:45:20,170 --> 01:45:23,260
to code so I want to talk about how you

2228
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,580
can actually use your coding skills to

2229
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:25,930
actually make 3d objects and that's

2230
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:27,940
something done by something called open

2231
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:30,220
sketch open s get whatever you want to

2232
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:32,710
call it I have absolutely no affiliation

2233
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:35,980
with this project whatsoever I'm just a

2234
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:38,020
fan user of it it's open source you can

2235
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:40,360
run down your Mac Linux whatever machine

2236
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:42,160
you have even on a Raspberry Pi and by

2237
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:45,070
using code you can actually or take a

2238
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:48,190
DXF file a 2d design file and turn it

2239
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:50,200
into a 3d file or completely from scrap

2240
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:52,030
create objects so you can start very

2241
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,280
simply by saying okay I want to have a

2242
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:56,769
cube and then you just give a command

2243
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:59,019
called a cube 10 by 10 by 10 and you

2244
01:45:56,770 --> 01:46:00,580
have a 3d cube in space and you can see

2245
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,500
from the syntax it's somewhat like C

2246
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:04,269
language based so it's if you're

2247
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,920
familiar with programming and Arduino or

2248
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:08,230
something like that you'll find the

2249
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,400
syntax to be very familiar and there are

2250
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:11,379
all kinds of other shapes that you can

2251
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,910
make you can make a cylinder you can

2252
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:14,500
actually make a cylinder with the top

2253
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:16,510
and the bottom radius to be different so

2254
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:18,280
you get a comb and all those kinds of

2255
01:46:16,510 --> 01:46:19,870
things you can actually make but as it

2256
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,940
is a programming language you can

2257
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:24,580
actually do operations with these things

2258
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:26,410
so I can take that cube and I can take

2259
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:29,080
that cylinder and by putting a

2260
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:31,150
difference command around it it actually

2261
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,500
always first draws the first object

2262
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:34,719
within the difference commands and

2263
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,700
anything else than what I specify it

2264
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:38,740
actually subtracts from it so I end up

2265
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:40,809
in this case with a cube with a hole

2266
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:42,700
through it and whatever all our objects

2267
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:45,520
I add within that difference command it

2268
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:47,139
starts subtracting that one other method

2269
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,310
that you can actually draw more complex

2270
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:50,680
shape something that I actually use a

2271
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:54,580
lot is I can put for instance a few

2272
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:56,440
cylinders and in a particular order I'm

2273
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:58,240
using the cylinder command here and I

2274
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:00,070
use a translate command to actually

2275
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,929
place it somewhere in space so a

2276
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:03,790
particular and in this case like a

2277
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:06,010
triangle now I have these three

2278
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:08,350
cylinders by just simply putting a whole

2279
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:12,550
command around it it makes a 3d object

2280
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:14,500
of that outline of that shape now if I

2281
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:16,450
want to have maybe holes in this

2282
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:19,540
triangle I can take those exact same

2283
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:21,130
three cylinders just shorten the radius

2284
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:23,140
a little bit but keeping one on the same

2285
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:25,270
space and use my difference commands and

2286
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:27,100
I end up having a nice triangular plate

2287
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:29,650
with rounded corners with holes in it

2288
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,180
and all that kind of stuff but the nice

2289
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:32,799
thing about all this is is it a

2290
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:34,690
programming language so you can really

2291
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,670
make the benefits of having a

2292
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:39,820
programming language so when I design

2293
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:41,020
stuff I'm very impatient I very quickly

2294
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:42,309
want to make something and then I'll

2295
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:44,620
find out everything that's wrong about

2296
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:46,000
it and I'll go back and fix it you can

2297
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:47,860
do that all with parameters so in the

2298
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,260
pro beginning of my program i define my

2299
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:52,360
parameters that i'll probably later know

2300
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:55,000
that i will have to change and i make

2301
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:57,219
modules for these objects to make my

2302
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,600
code very simple and very readable and

2303
01:47:57,220 --> 01:48:00,130
this is really how you can leverage the

2304
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:01,690
power you can loops and all those kinds

2305
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:01,989
of things to really make very complex

2306
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:05,889
thing

2307
01:48:01,989 --> 01:48:07,239
with just a few lines of code now even

2308
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:09,340
you might not have ever heard of the

2309
01:48:07,239 --> 01:48:11,440
existence of open s cat if you have ever

2310
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:13,570
visited thingy first you probably have

2311
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:16,599
been in contact with these kind of open

2312
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:19,570
scat files if you go to finger furs the

2313
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,560
website to download 3d objects from you

2314
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:22,599
can select on something called

2315
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:25,239
customizable anything that is

2316
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:27,969
customizable means it is actually

2317
01:48:25,239 --> 01:48:29,980
written in open s cat and therefore

2318
01:48:27,969 --> 01:48:32,560
anything that's written a basket even on

2319
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:34,799
Thingiverse itself and that is

2320
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:38,020
customizable you can even in the webpage

2321
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:40,420
and change therefore so for instance in

2322
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:42,160
this example this is a cylinder slot you

2323
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:43,900
want to change the code on how to make

2324
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:45,250
it up the slot you don't have to know

2325
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:47,769
how to program you don't have to

2326
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:49,750
download even open s ket whatsoever in

2327
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:51,400
thing if there's website you see there

2328
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:53,530
are four variables for the numbers that

2329
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:55,239
you want to have for the object and it

2330
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:57,250
will automatically adjust a code but

2331
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:59,950
what's the great thing on that same page

2332
01:48:57,250 --> 01:49:02,140
you find a button few source so you can

2333
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:04,450
actually see the source code on how this

2334
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:06,550
object was created by that person and

2335
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:08,980
all that person does is in the beginning

2336
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:10,960
specify those variables those variables

2337
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:13,299
therefore are picked up by Thingiverse

2338
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:15,070
to show it into a nice web interface and

2339
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:17,410
then you can take all that code that is

2340
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:19,269
in existence there so let me give you

2341
01:49:17,410 --> 01:49:21,910
some examples that are out there if you

2342
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:22,989
for instance lost your keys well T not

2343
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:24,510
if you lost your keys if you only have

2344
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:28,239
one key left and you need more keys

2345
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:30,070
someone with an open scat program that

2346
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:32,019
you can make a photo of your camera of

2347
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:33,549
your key it will analyze it and

2348
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:36,580
automatically translate it into an

2349
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:41,140
actual 3d printable key so you can have

2350
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:43,360
spare keys other projects oh and someone

2351
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:44,739
made a customizable thing thrown on your

2352
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,030
laptop too that you don't have to put a

2353
01:49:44,739 --> 01:49:47,410
silly sticker on it or something like

2354
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:48,759
that but you can make something nice

2355
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:50,800
with your name and other stuff like to

2356
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,270
hide your camera and someone made it for

2357
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,489
quick set keys if you have a quick set

2358
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:56,380
key actually tested this last week you

2359
01:49:54,489 --> 01:49:58,360
can just type in the code and you you

2360
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:00,190
get it so hopefully I've given you some

2361
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:03,480
ideas and go create and make something

2362
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:03,480
and share thank you

2363
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:17,489
the the next talk is about introducing

2364
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:26,219
neurodiversity by yeongja its young yeah

2365
01:50:17,489 --> 01:50:28,138
yeah yeah come on stage so also the

2366
01:50:26,219 --> 01:50:30,239
speakers for the next session please get

2367
01:50:28,139 --> 01:50:34,020
ready on the truck before you so we can

2368
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:41,638
change the stage quickly and now you

2369
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:48,110
have the stage don't you yeah okay so

2370
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:48,110
yeah neurodiversity what exactly is that

2371
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:54,960
well there's Niro in it so it's gotta

2372
01:50:52,860 --> 01:51:00,058
have something to do with neurology and

2373
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:03,150
it does and it's in fact the diversity

2374
01:51:00,059 --> 01:51:06,300
of the neurology of our brain what does

2375
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:09,989
that have to do with computers well not

2376
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:16,380
much except if you view the brain as one

2377
01:51:09,989 --> 01:51:18,750
giant computer so yeah the concept is

2378
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:21,480
basically that all humans have

2379
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:22,829
a different neurological makeup and

2380
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:27,178
there's of course going to be summer

2381
01:51:22,829 --> 01:51:30,630
right variety about that and from which

2382
01:51:27,179 --> 01:51:38,309
we have obviously profited as humans

2383
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:41,309
across our entire existence but there

2384
01:51:38,309 --> 01:51:45,210
has been in the last decade or so a

2385
01:51:41,309 --> 01:51:48,750
trend of putting that taking that

2386
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:54,690
concept or the fact that there's a

2387
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:57,510
certain variance and turning that start

2388
01:51:54,690 --> 01:52:00,449
slowly narrowing the concept of what we

2389
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:06,270
define as normal and so creating

2390
01:52:00,449 --> 01:52:09,138
basically illnesses or disorders and so

2391
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:13,559
what exactly falls into that for example

2392
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:15,119
the concept of autism or ADHD or

2393
01:52:13,559 --> 01:52:18,949
may or

2394
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:22,199
bipolar disorder on many of these other

2395
01:52:18,949 --> 01:52:24,269
yeah things that we usually define as

2396
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:26,909
mental illnesses or do disorders and are

2397
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:32,460
currently trying to cure are actually

2398
01:52:26,909 --> 01:52:35,759
not that there are things that humans

2399
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:37,980
have done over human brains have done

2400
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,900
over our entire existence and there's

2401
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:42,928
proof of that this proof for example in

2402
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:44,989
stone a charge that there were people

2403
01:52:42,929 --> 01:52:48,920
with specific processing this

2404
01:52:44,989 --> 01:52:52,968
differences and those are the same that

2405
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:58,579
autistic people most likely most of them

2406
01:52:52,969 --> 01:53:01,500
exhibit so we can with British with

2407
01:52:58,579 --> 01:53:04,349
pretty surely say that there were

2408
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:06,420
adjusting people in Stone Age so should

2409
01:53:04,349 --> 01:53:10,320
we really be trying to cure something

2410
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:13,050
that has existed of all this time and

2411
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:19,940
has in fact been positive seasonally

2412
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:23,670
selected by genetics so the idea that

2413
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:29,070
many of these things that we define as

2414
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:31,889
disorders might not be of course calls

2415
01:53:29,070 --> 01:53:33,900
into question our concept of what is

2416
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:36,900
normal and in fact that concept is just

2417
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:42,888
a concept and not something that is

2418
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:45,269
somehow defined in nature and that

2419
01:53:42,889 --> 01:53:48,659
doesn't necessarily invalidate the

2420
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:53,610
experiences of people of autistic people

2421
01:53:48,659 --> 01:53:58,259
or ADHD people or whatever but it

2422
01:53:53,610 --> 01:54:00,780
defines how we treat them and it is the

2423
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:04,739
concept of neuro diversity is related to

2424
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:06,809
the concept of to the social model or

2425
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:10,259
concept of disability which means that

2426
01:54:06,809 --> 01:54:13,349
some things that are disabilities in our

2427
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:14,909
current culture our only disabilities

2428
01:54:13,349 --> 01:54:18,420
because our culture is built in a

2429
01:54:14,909 --> 01:54:21,690
certain way so for example being deaf or

2430
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:24,300
hard of hearing is only a disability and

2431
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:26,268
some deaf or hard-of-hearing people do

2432
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:28,160
not define themselves as disabled

2433
01:54:26,269 --> 01:54:31,970
because we

2434
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:33,980
talk with speech and we need to hear it

2435
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:38,810
and in fact that has not always been

2436
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:42,290
true many linguist linguists now think

2437
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:46,790
that the first language that when humans

2438
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:50,150
first started to develop language was

2439
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:52,670
actually a sign language so even the

2440
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:55,460
concept that we need to talk it's not

2441
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:57,470
it's just based that on the fact that

2442
01:54:55,460 --> 01:55:03,110
most of our cultures talk but not all of

2443
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:06,710
them so what does never I city I have to

2444
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:09,400
do with the internet and well most of

2445
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:12,320
the things that we're talking about here

2446
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:14,450
well first of all for the nervous regime

2447
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:16,700
neurodiversity movement and for many

2448
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:18,920
people who are neurodiverse in some way

2449
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:23,120
whether they're artistic or ADHD or

2450
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:25,640
bipolar or whatever the emergence of the

2451
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:30,890
internet and especially the emergence of

2452
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:35,450
social media has been well a radical

2453
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:38,530
change in our lives because there's it's

2454
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:41,530
new modes of coming communication and

2455
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:41,530
yeah

2456
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:57,700
the next talk is coming with AI powered

2457
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:57,700
robots in real life by how

2458
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:13,800
but don't give up trying just alright so

2459
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:17,070
my name is how I founded this company

2460
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:19,949
called or about five years ago this is

2461
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:23,130
about to show you what they state of art

2462
01:56:19,949 --> 01:56:25,949
of AI and how they can apply to robots

2463
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:27,989
that actually work in real life so there

2464
01:56:25,949 --> 01:56:29,909
are about 50 slides bear with me

2465
01:56:27,989 --> 01:56:32,218
now what's a yeah there's a one

2466
01:56:29,909 --> 01:56:32,820
definition of AI is thinking or acting

2467
01:56:32,219 --> 01:56:35,640
rationally

2468
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:37,920
and AI is used very widely to the left

2469
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:39,870
is what AI is used thirty years ago

2470
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:43,140
which is recognizing handwritten digits

2471
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:45,809
and what AI can do now is identifying

2472
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:47,370
each of the cars in a picture and then

2473
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:50,040
actually separating them so they know

2474
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:51,840
they're different cars and there are a

2475
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:53,850
bunch of other applications of AI are

2476
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:57,330
they I can play go beat the top and top

2477
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:59,489
human player AI can allow you to go into

2478
01:56:57,330 --> 01:57:02,610
a store pick up item and then leave

2479
01:56:59,489 --> 01:57:04,860
without waiting in the line for trick

2480
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:06,389
for for checking right so you don't need

2481
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,159
to pay with your credit card stuff they

2482
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:12,120
are just recognize who you are and what

2483
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:13,949
item you pick up as you go and then we

2484
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:17,429
have robots that moves shelves in the

2485
01:57:13,949 --> 01:57:20,790
warehouses to kind of ship stuff that

2486
01:57:17,429 --> 01:57:23,730
you buy ordered online and yeah I can't

2487
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:25,650
recognize stuff in the video whether

2488
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:28,379
whether or not this part of the video is

2489
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:30,809
a car or the human and I can recommend

2490
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:34,500
you similar products that you've

2491
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:37,440
searched for I can tell you where you

2492
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:39,060
should drive on the map or I can fetch a

2493
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:42,178
cup of coffee for you operate a coffee

2494
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:44,280
machine and can generate you know

2495
01:57:42,179 --> 01:57:47,340
different kind kind of things attic or

2496
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:48,989
generate or replace a face of a

2497
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:51,540
character onto another one that you

2498
01:57:48,989 --> 01:57:54,389
cannot distinguish as a human can think

2499
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:58,590
that ik new faces based on source

2500
01:57:54,390 --> 01:58:00,780
pictures so the people's face on the

2501
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:03,330
bottom right is they don't exist right

2502
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:05,759
there I think that human the best this

2503
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:09,719
is my favorite AI can actually beat a

2504
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:11,730
human Starcraft player already by just

2505
01:58:09,719 --> 01:58:15,210
what these are the realization of how

2506
01:58:11,730 --> 01:58:17,169
the neural network works so if you're

2507
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:20,260
interested the slightest online there

2508
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:22,090
reference spoke about AI and a robot is

2509
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:24,790
a machine that can carry out the

2510
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:27,820
physical tasks basically and there are

2511
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:29,769
just differences between the robots

2512
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:31,179
before versus robot now basically robot

2513
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:33,880
nowadays with AI equipped

2514
01:58:31,179 --> 01:58:35,469
can work a more unstructured or dynamic

2515
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:36,969
environment versus a robot before can

2516
01:58:35,469 --> 01:58:39,610
only work in structured environment

2517
01:58:36,969 --> 01:58:42,699
that's programmed now previously we do

2518
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:44,949
2d vision now we can do 3d previously

2519
01:58:42,699 --> 01:58:46,780
the mobile robot have to follow lines on

2520
01:58:44,949 --> 01:58:48,879
the ground now we can navigate freely in

2521
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:50,530
any environment previously you have to

2522
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,360
use a teacher pendant or remote control

2523
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:54,849
to program the robot now we can actually

2524
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:57,400
have the robot compute its own paths

2525
01:58:54,850 --> 01:58:58,780
automatically and previously we have

2526
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,580
rigid robot now we have collaborative

2527
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:03,460
robot that even if it hits you it

2528
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:06,370
doesn't break your bones now to the left

2529
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:09,310
is what I built in 2012 in North Bridge

2530
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:10,599
in San Francisco to the right is after

2531
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:14,980
the companies established it will be

2532
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:17,620
built in 2017 so both are mobile

2533
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:20,410
modulator and all the following are how

2534
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:22,750
they can get applied this is a gripper

2535
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:26,620
it's the extented mimicking human hand

2536
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:29,110
it can grasp both it can run a kind of

2537
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:31,900
operator screwdriver it can kind of put

2538
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:33,750
salt on a plate we can also have the

2539
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:36,429
remote manipulator draw pictures

2540
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:40,300
operating coffee machine making

2541
01:59:36,429 --> 01:59:44,230
dumplings picking items from the shelf

2542
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:46,929
directly and this is how it works so

2543
01:59:44,230 --> 01:59:48,790
basically the it shows how the robot

2544
01:59:46,929 --> 01:59:52,030
evaluates environment around it and then

2545
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:55,030
figure out how to grasp an item so how

2546
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:57,219
do we apply it to real life right so one

2547
01:59:55,030 --> 02:00:00,219
one of the options is conference service

2548
01:59:57,219 --> 02:00:01,239
so I just came from Macau in this

2549
02:00:00,219 --> 02:00:03,489
international conference on

2550
02:00:01,239 --> 02:00:06,750
International Conference of AI and then

2551
02:00:03,489 --> 02:00:10,330
we we put robot in use so we have

2552
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:12,699
comparative parents presents their badge

2553
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:14,739
to the robot and then the robot fetches

2554
02:00:12,699 --> 02:00:17,440
the souvenir and then presented the

2555
02:00:14,739 --> 02:00:19,330
souvenir to the to the president we have

2556
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:22,480
people lining up for receiving the

2557
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:24,070
souvenir from robot we have coffee

2558
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:26,049
pouring robots so we have a barrel with

2559
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:27,759
coffee and then if the robot sees you

2560
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:29,770
stands in front of it it opposed the

2561
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,930
level on the coffee ball Barrow

2562
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:34,780
and then kind of present you with the

2563
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:36,280
cup of coffee and this is my favorite

2564
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:38,259
part so essentially what's happening is

2565
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:44,920
we have mobile robots running around in

2566
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:47,670
the reception and have so we have them

2567
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:49,840
serving drinks but then they soon become

2568
02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:53,020
garbage collection robot because people

2569
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,550
just put place on them and this is what

2570
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:57,370
the company is mainly about we actually

2571
02:00:54,550 --> 02:01:00,520
put robot in logistics so loading boxes

2572
02:00:57,370 --> 02:01:01,809
into trailers sorting packages in

2573
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:03,370
different ways of sorting packages

2574
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:05,920
different ways of sorting items that's

2575
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:10,540
not in a package and all the stuff and

2576
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:16,840
then yeah so if you are interested talk

2577
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:19,960
to me this is my contact thanks thank

2578
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:21,610
you very much dear audience I'm very shy

2579
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:24,370
and don't like to interrupt people

2580
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:26,349
that's why I need your help so bad I

2581
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:28,599
don't think we need your help for the

2582
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:30,790
next speaker because I'm very very happy

2583
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:34,330
to have been here on stage I'm very

2584
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:38,260
happy he could be convinced be here the

2585
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:40,540
next talk will be and German and it's

2586
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:46,930
been saying Yahoo doodle and a few

2587
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:48,610
twists 9 resume yeah hello okay I

2588
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:50,500
thought senior doodle is never an

2589
02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:52,480
assistant vinegar it was to display vice

2590
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:53,530
was to delicious the studio is here stay

2591
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:58,150
toasty booty area

2592
02:01:53,530 --> 02:02:01,840
hey and cool done way vice-versa osseous

2593
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:04,420
doodle just business under fear you know

2594
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:07,150
as ask a technician cow moos OVAs on

2595
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:08,890
Swan event scheduling aplicación the

what I'm going to tell you so I want to

2715
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:33,730
take this opportunity to tell you about

2716
02:07:30,909 --> 02:07:36,159
a great milestone that we achieved just

2717
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:40,059
last week so this is really like nice

2718
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:41,619
and hot stuff but I also want to thank

2719
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:44,520
everyone who was involved in the

2720
02:07:41,619 --> 02:07:48,190
creation of and in the process of this

2721
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:53,290
project the conversation around it

2722
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:55,169
started taking shape in 2011 2012 and it

2723
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:59,920
took a while before we reach the state

2724
02:07:55,170 --> 02:08:03,099
in 2016 where we started by creating a

2725
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:06,150
legal entity so I don't really see my

2726
02:08:03,099 --> 02:08:09,760
slides so I don't know what's going on

2727
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:14,530
there are lots of the slides so in 2016

2728
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:18,099
we created an entity called the Center

2729
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:20,800
for the cultivation of Technology what

2730
02:08:18,099 --> 02:08:23,560
what is it it's a German nonprofit

2731
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,239
limited liability company so it's

2732
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:28,030
something that you don't see that often

2733
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:30,940
usually people create mine atsuko Viner

2734
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:33,849
this is a is a company but it's also a

2735
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:37,360
charity and what does this charity do

2736
02:08:33,849 --> 02:08:39,909
the charity is a legal host for open

2737
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:43,119
source projects so whenever projects

2738
02:08:39,909 --> 02:08:46,719
have to interact with money

2739
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:50,199
they need some kind of way of making the

2740
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:55,929
money flow and we provide a legal entity

2741
02:08:50,199 --> 02:09:00,119
that you can pick and choose to help you

2742
02:08:55,929 --> 02:09:04,719
with your money this is the quote from

2743
02:09:00,119 --> 02:09:07,420
the bylaws and this is leading to what

2744
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:10,090
milestone we reached so we created a

2745
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:12,880
legal entity that says in the bylaws

2746
02:09:10,090 --> 02:09:18,130
that the goal of the of the organization

2747
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:20,110
is to develop and further the free and

2748
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:22,989
open technologies and bear with me this

2749
02:09:20,110 --> 02:09:24,699
is not a perfectly fine definition for

2750
02:09:22,989 --> 02:09:25,178
everything else but this is targeted

2751
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:27,400
towards

2752
02:09:25,179 --> 02:09:29,769
the text authorities because we have to

2753
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:31,659
argue why are we our charity why are we

2754
02:09:29,769 --> 02:09:34,809
doing stuff that is beneficial to the

2755
02:09:31,659 --> 02:09:37,030
public and before we started this I

2756
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:38,320
talked to many different lawyers I

2757
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:43,150
talked to many different organizations

2758
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:45,789
and everyone was like maybe development

2759
02:09:43,150 --> 02:09:50,949
of software cannot be a charitable

2760
02:09:45,789 --> 02:09:56,079
activity so we tried we set out to do it

2761
02:09:50,949 --> 02:09:58,209
and this is kind of what we some of the

2762
02:09:56,079 --> 02:10:00,188
kind of services that we are providing

2763
02:09:58,209 --> 02:10:02,469
to our projects we're not done yet

2764
02:10:00,189 --> 02:10:05,229
so this is an in-progress conversation

2765
02:10:02,469 --> 02:10:10,119
we want to help people with the donation

2766
02:10:05,229 --> 02:10:14,739
processing we help projects with grants

2767
02:10:10,119 --> 02:10:18,728
and other supporting contracts but we

2768
02:10:14,739 --> 02:10:21,699
also look at the side of okay there's

2769
02:10:18,729 --> 02:10:24,159
money coming into the project how does

2770
02:10:21,699 --> 02:10:26,829
the team make decisions around spending

2771
02:10:24,159 --> 02:10:29,469
the money how can the project create

2772
02:10:26,829 --> 02:10:31,688
some transparency towards the people

2773
02:10:29,469 --> 02:10:34,030
giving money and also towards the team

2774
02:10:31,689 --> 02:10:35,769
itself so that's a big part of what

2775
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:38,829
we're building is kind of a management

2776
02:10:35,769 --> 02:10:40,510
platform for similar organizations they

2777
02:10:38,829 --> 02:10:42,188
might be in completely different spaces

2778
02:10:40,510 --> 02:10:45,729
they might be around political activism

2779
02:10:42,189 --> 02:10:48,459
or other fields where you want to share

2780
02:10:45,729 --> 02:10:54,909
a legal entity across many different

2781
02:10:48,459 --> 02:10:56,860
projects so we started in October 2016

2782
02:10:54,909 --> 02:10:58,598
to register the entity so the first

2783
02:10:56,860 --> 02:11:00,699
business year was October November

2784
02:10:58,599 --> 02:11:07,559
December 2016

2785
02:11:00,699 --> 02:11:11,159
in 2016 we started slowly doing stuff

2786
02:11:07,559 --> 02:11:16,139
but the real first business year was

2787
02:11:11,159 --> 02:11:21,219
2017 and this was a crucial kind of a

2788
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:23,619
phase because you the how the text

2789
02:11:21,219 --> 02:11:26,499
authorities evaluate your charity status

2790
02:11:23,619 --> 02:11:29,049
is based on previous activities so they

2791
02:11:26,499 --> 02:11:31,478
look into the past you finalize the full

2792
02:11:29,050 --> 02:11:33,880
year you submit the documents you submit

2793
02:11:31,479 --> 02:11:36,639
an annual report explaining what you did

2794
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:39,250
and then you wait and this was the face

2795
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:43,900
the past months we submitted

2796
02:11:39,250 --> 02:11:45,910
so a while ago the 2017 filings and you

2797
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:48,360
can see some numbers here so in our

2798
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:52,330
first official business year we already

2799
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:55,080
had eight hundred thousand euros in

2800
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:58,990
money coming in to projects that we host

2801
02:11:55,080 --> 02:12:02,350
we spent a hundred and forty two kilo

2802
02:11:58,990 --> 02:12:04,059
euros on employment so we can provide

2803
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:09,510
employment for people in case they want

2804
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:14,490
that and we paid 149 kilo euros to

2805
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:14,490
contractors that develop software and

2806
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:20,650
this is the achievement it's the

2807
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:27,280
confirmation of our charity status thank

2808
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:30,250
you so the next talk is going about a

2809
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:34,230
digital climate strike it's hold by blip

2810
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:47,650
is blip here please come to stage and

2811
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:52,120
you Steve clicks it hi we are in the

2812
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:55,480
midst of a climate crisis we cannot long

2813
02:12:52,120 --> 02:13:00,099
ecologist global warming it's a fully

2814
02:12:55,480 --> 02:13:02,650
fledged crisis temperatures rise huge

2815
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:07,540
areas of ice glaciers have melted

2816
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:12,910
already species get extinct insect

2817
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:17,200
populations decrease our ecosystem is

2818
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:22,090
experiencing huge harm and for us humans

2819
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:24,809
this is dangerous not just for the

2820
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:30,100
animals and the planet but also for us

2821
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:33,810
areas will get inhabitable new illnesses

2822
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:36,790
will rise with the rising temperatures

2823
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:39,300
the reason for all this has been known

2824
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:44,680
for decades and is confirmed by

2825
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:48,100
scientists we have been and still are

2826
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:49,500
emitting too many greenhouse gases into

2827
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:53,630
the atmosphere

2828
02:13:49,500 --> 02:14:00,440
we are just burning too much fossil fuel

2829
02:13:53,630 --> 02:14:04,110
too much oil too much gas we have been

2830
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:07,139
yeah some insects still live on my arm

2831
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:09,240
so that's a good sign that way we have

2832
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:11,850
been externalizing costs on the

2833
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:14,210
environment for too long and science

2834
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:18,390
shows that we cannot continue like this

2835
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:23,310
we need to be carbon neutral by 2025

2836
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:27,750
this is in almost five years individual

2837
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:31,010
actions are not enough to change this we

2838
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:35,280
need large-scale change we need

2839
02:14:31,010 --> 02:14:37,110
governments to change policies Friday's

2840
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:39,719
for future extinction rebellion and

2841
02:14:37,110 --> 02:14:41,130
other organizations have been calling

2842
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:45,270
for the next international climate

2843
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:47,270
strike on September 28th this year this

2844
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:50,070
is in a month

2845
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:51,870
please go participate in the strike go

2846

2847
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:58,070
family and co-workers and now finally

2848
02:14:55,620 --> 02:15:01,110
coming to what you can see on this slide

2849
02:14:58,070 --> 02:15:04,200
please consider joining the strike on

2850
02:15:01,110 --> 02:15:07,410
the internet if you run a website or a

2851
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:09,599
blog or a social media profile consider

2852
02:15:07,410 --> 02:15:12,630
blacking out or greening out your

2853
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:15,150
website display a different avatar

2854
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:17,340
to raise awareness for the international

2855
02:15:15,150 --> 02:15:19,410
climate strike week that will start on

2856
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:22,620
September 20 and continued until

2857
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:26,460
September 27 you can find some resources

2858
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:28,950
on these three internet websites I put

2859
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:32,370
on my slide shut down for climate dotnet

2860
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:34,470
shut down for climate dot de for a

2861
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:36,870
German version and soon also digital

2862
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:40,230
climate strike net which is not yet

2863
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:42,180
online there is templates for these

2864
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:47,429
blackout sites there is a wordpress

2865
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:48,930
plugin there will be more soon so please

2866
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:53,610
let the internet participate in the

2867
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:55,500
strike here on the camp i have corgin

2868
02:15:53,610 --> 02:15:57,330
izing the bits and trees village bits on

2869
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:58,980
poem we are the sustainability village

2870
02:15:57,330 --> 02:16:00,100
on camp so if you're interested in what

2871
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:02,110
we do here

2872
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:05,110
come to the about freedom cluster today

2873
02:16:02,110 --> 02:16:06,820
at 4 p.m. we will have a panel where a

2874
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:08,650
lot of organizations will present

2875
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:11,230
themselves among status fighters for

2876
02:16:08,650 --> 02:16:15,160
future extinction rebellion sees three

2877
02:16:11,230 --> 02:16:18,160
sustainability that tries to make CCC

2878
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:20,889
events more sustainable so please come

2879
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:22,450
by have a look and if you're motivated

2880
02:16:20,890 --> 02:16:30,910
to help please join us

2881
02:16:22,450 --> 02:16:35,879
Thanks the next arc is open science and

2882
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:35,879
open robotics the pocket science level

2883
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,920
much

2884
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:04,769
okay yep I'm gonna talk about pocket

2885
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:07,558
science lab some of you might know it

2886
02:17:04,769 --> 02:17:09,689
already it's an open hardware device and

2887
02:17:07,558 --> 02:17:12,840
since recently you can also use it for

2888
02:17:09,689 --> 02:17:15,990
robotics and the whole story of the open

2889
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:18,090
pocket science lab started in 2014 when

2890
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:21,299
Praveen came to the fourth Asia Summit

2891
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:23,609
that here in Cambodia we ran it at that

2892
02:17:21,299 --> 02:17:26,459
time in plum pen and he Andrew

2893
02:17:23,609 --> 02:17:30,090
introduced the idea of an open hardware

2894
02:17:26,459 --> 02:17:34,500
device for experiments specifically for

2895
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:37,500
physics so the first versions of open of

2896
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:40,170
this open hardware looked like this it

2897
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:42,568
was the Arduino Uno form factor and we

2898
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:46,710
continuously developed it later on it

2899
02:17:42,568 --> 02:17:49,318
cut this size that we also used today so

2900
02:17:46,709 --> 02:17:52,638
today it also supports Bluetooth you can

2901
02:17:49,318 --> 02:17:55,500
attach Wi-Fi module for the esp8266

2902
02:17:52,638 --> 02:18:00,500
there are many small enhancements and

2903
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:03,269
recently we even achieved to attach more

2904
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:06,750
digital pins for example so you can run

2905
02:18:03,269 --> 02:18:09,300
more devices at the same time and yeah

2906
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:11,968
more sensors so this is how it looks

2907
02:18:09,299 --> 02:18:14,608
like it's developed together with the

2908
02:18:11,968 --> 02:18:17,580
first asia community and open tech in

2909
02:18:14,609 --> 02:18:21,809
germany and we produce last large

2910
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:23,670
batches in germany and in china so try

2911
02:18:21,808 --> 02:18:26,068
to also make it sustainable and

2912
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:30,299
available for everyone there are many

2913
02:18:26,068 --> 02:18:32,699
useful instruments on it so components

2914
02:18:30,299 --> 02:18:34,558
can be attached by pins we have a

2915
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:36,870
desktop app we have an android app and

2916
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:39,779
you can build your own apps we support

2917
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:43,290
standards like the UART standard how it

2918
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:45,450
works you connected here through an app

2919
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:47,700
app for example on the mobile phone and

2920
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:49,830
there's a USB connection and you can

2921
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:53,309
power the device also through your

2922
02:18:49,830 --> 02:18:57,990
mobile phone then you click on these

2923
02:18:53,308 --> 02:19:01,529
apps there and so there are instruments

2924
02:18:57,990 --> 02:19:04,349
inside the app that you can access for

2925
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:07,120
example an oscilloscope multimeter logic

2926
02:19:04,349 --> 02:19:10,309
analyzer wave generator powers

2927
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:12,560
accelerometer barometer compass you can

2928
02:19:10,309 --> 02:19:15,170
attach a lot of sensors any sensor that

2929
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:18,199
runs with adrenal will also work with us

2930
02:19:15,170 --> 02:19:21,050
and we are adding more and more sensors

2931
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:23,000
for gas for example PHP a pH meter and

2932
02:19:21,050 --> 02:19:26,059
so on so this is then how the

2933
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,670
oscilloscope looks like and you see

2934
02:19:26,059 --> 02:19:32,119
different waves for example the power

2935
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:34,730
source here's the multi meter wave

2936
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:38,150
generator and logic analyzer you can

2937
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:40,910
create digital waves with digital

2938
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:46,359
instrument or with analog instruments

2939
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:49,490
and recently we introduced the this

2940
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:53,660
instrument and is actually not to read

2941
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:56,960
is actually to control servos so small

2942
02:19:53,660 --> 02:20:00,650
motors you can have four motors and you

2943
02:19:56,960 --> 02:20:03,080
can draw here at which angle you want

2944
02:20:00,650 --> 02:20:05,750
and then drag and drop them into a time

2945
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:08,271
line similar to a video editor so this

2946
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:11,391
was really cool we ran a workshop here

2947
02:20:08,271 --> 02:20:14,721
in Shenzhen a few weeks ago and you

2948
02:20:11,391 --> 02:20:17,391
actually May 8 yeah and you see people

2949
02:20:14,721 --> 02:20:19,699
really get excited and want to build it

2950
02:20:17,391 --> 02:20:21,170
and there's a small robot on the table

2951
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:23,351
that they try to control with it so

2952
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:25,880
that's really something new and cool

2953
02:20:23,351 --> 02:20:30,170
another thing that we are doing is you

2954
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:32,180
know able to generate config files you

2955
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:34,521
can attach an ESP and then control the

2956
02:20:32,181 --> 02:20:38,000
device through Wi-Fi and you can leave

2957
02:20:34,521 --> 02:20:41,000
it offline anywhere and come back at

2958
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,440
some point later and collect the data so

2959
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,811
for example you can control time

2960
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:46,181
interval you can control channels and so

2961
02:20:44,811 --> 02:20:49,160
on so whatever you can do with the app

2962
02:20:46,181 --> 02:20:51,500
connected you should also be do be able

2963
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:53,539
to do it when the app is not connected

2964
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:57,380
and come back later and use the device

2965
02:20:53,540 --> 02:21:00,261
as a complete data logger yeah here a

2966
02:20:57,380 --> 02:21:01,670
few specs for the experts in the room

2967
02:21:00,261 --> 02:21:04,880
and they're always a lot of questions

2968
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:06,380
you can find them also on our website so

2969
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:08,240
it's for example me the first question

2970
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:11,119
is always how many channels so we have

2971
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:14,931
four channels and we have two msps so

2972
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:17,210
and if you use several sensors at the

2973
02:21:14,931 --> 02:21:19,660
same time of course you have to like

2974
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:22,028
it's not like every device can have this

2975
02:21:19,660 --> 02:21:24,460
kind of XS you need to separate this so

2976
02:21:22,029 --> 02:21:27,250
that their bottleneck is basically the

2977
02:21:24,460 --> 02:21:30,278
USB connection if you use Wi-Fi actually

2978
02:21:27,250 --> 02:21:32,800
we can also talk about like making it

2979
02:21:30,279 --> 02:21:35,950
faster making the bandwidth wider and so

2980
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:37,569
on but it wasn't needed so far how can

2981
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:40,180
you get involved in the project so the

2982
02:21:37,569 --> 02:21:52,330
whole project is open it is free and

2983
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:55,000
open so please join us thank you thank

2984
02:21:52,330 --> 02:21:56,859
you very much now there is a Sofia Sadie

2985
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,970
we are going to learn something about

2986
02:21:56,859 --> 02:22:08,290
Ola beanie

2987
02:21:57,970 --> 02:22:10,119
thank you for your being here okay thank

2988
02:22:08,290 --> 02:22:11,620
you hello my name is Sophia Shelley and

2989
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:13,420
I'm the partner and colleague of Ulla

2990
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:16,060
beanie and today I'm going to talk about

2991
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:19,300
him because he is unfairly persecuted in

2992
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:21,189
Ecuador which is my home country and he

2993
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:22,990
was illegally detained and right now

2994
02:22:21,189 --> 02:22:25,229
he's under investigation for the alleged

2995
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:28,810
crime of hacking into computer systems

2996
02:22:25,229 --> 02:22:31,028
so the first thing we're talking about

2997
02:22:28,810 --> 02:22:33,670
you Lavinia is actually asking ourselves

2998
02:22:31,029 --> 02:22:35,080
who is all vini so olivine is a software

2999
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:38,560
developer who many times have

3000
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:40,569
participated in CCC and he mainly works

3001
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:42,910
right now on security cryptography and

3002
02:22:40,569 --> 02:22:45,220
privacy developing software to enhance

3003
02:22:42,910 --> 02:22:47,560
privacy and security and cryptography

3004
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:50,050
but also on the research in cryptography

3005
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:52,689
itself on the past he was also our

3006
02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:54,608
collaborator into several programming

3007
02:22:52,689 --> 02:22:56,410
languages especially with the JRuby

3008
02:22:54,609 --> 02:22:58,170
project but he has also been around

3009
02:22:56,410 --> 02:23:00,640
collaborating with other security

3010
02:22:58,170 --> 02:23:02,290
project like the to project an email

3011
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:03,849
project the let's encrypt project and

3012
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:05,020
right now what we are leading is the

3013
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:06,819
Russian photo of the off-the-record

3014
02:23:05,020 --> 02:23:09,630
messaging protocol as a cryptographic

3015
02:23:06,819 --> 02:23:12,160
protocol but also its implementation

3016
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:14,259
right now as I said he is illegally

3017
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:15,850
detained in Ecuador with the alleged

3018
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:18,760
crime of hacking into computer systems

3019
02:23:15,850 --> 02:23:20,740
but actually this seems to be not

3020
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:23,920
actually the crime that he committed but

3021
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:25,869
even the EFS have actually concluded

3022
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:28,270
that it's not really he's not really

3023
02:23:25,870 --> 02:23:30,279
detained or investigated because of some

3024
02:23:28,270 --> 02:23:33,250
crime that he committed but actually

3025
02:23:30,279 --> 02:23:35,261
because of some political reasons

3026
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:37,301
basically the political resume seems to

3027
02:23:35,261 --> 02:23:41,171
be that he is a friend of Julian Assange

3028
02:23:37,301 --> 02:23:42,881
and as we know my country Ecuador has

3029
02:23:41,171 --> 02:23:44,710
expelled Julian Assange from the embassy

3030
02:23:42,881 --> 02:23:46,840
and ever since then there has been some

3031
02:23:44,710 --> 02:23:50,529
persecution again against sulla beany

3032
02:23:46,841 --> 02:23:52,061
ever since then so yeah the next

3033
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:53,980
question of course that I already talked

3034
02:23:52,061 --> 02:23:56,141
a little bit about what is why is he

3035
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:58,029
detained so how all of this happens is

3036
02:23:56,141 --> 02:24:00,369
the first question prior to answer the

3037
02:23:58,030 --> 02:24:02,950
main question so Halep this happen is an

3038
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:04,721
11 on April in which the day which

3039
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:07,721
Julian Assange was expelled from the

3040
02:24:04,721 --> 02:24:09,699
Embassy in Ecuador Lavinia was actually

3041
02:24:07,721 --> 02:24:12,520
detained in Ecuador when he was at the

3042
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:14,410
airport there was actually in a real

3043
02:24:12,521 --> 02:24:16,301
charges when he was detained he was just

3044
02:24:14,410 --> 02:24:18,580
detained because they wanted to detain

3045
02:24:16,301 --> 02:24:20,289
him there was no charges and apparently

3046
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:22,690
as I said the only reason while he was

3047
02:24:20,290 --> 02:24:24,910
good he was detained is because of his

3048
02:24:22,690 --> 02:24:26,290
friendship with Julian Assange over the

3049
02:24:24,910 --> 02:24:27,971
period of his investigation and

3050
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:29,801
detention process a lot of human rights

3051
02:24:27,971 --> 02:24:31,539
violations has happened as I said

3052
02:24:29,801 --> 02:24:33,551
there's no real charges so that's a

3053
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:35,860
human rights violations

3054
02:24:33,551 --> 02:24:38,230
he didn't had any access to his lawyers

3055
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:40,271
there was actually no presumption of

3056
02:24:38,230 --> 02:24:41,770
innocence he was actually guilt ever

3057
02:24:40,271 --> 02:24:44,891
since day one that he was sexually

3058
02:24:41,771 --> 02:24:47,471
detained he lived in officers conditions

3059
02:24:44,891 --> 02:24:49,181
because he was detained for 72 days in a

3060
02:24:47,471 --> 02:24:50,770
Latin American prison and I don't know

3061
02:24:49,181 --> 02:24:52,750
if you have ever visited a Latin

3062
02:24:50,771 --> 02:24:54,311
American prison is not the best cell

3063
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:58,660
condition seen he was actually living

3064
02:24:54,311 --> 02:25:00,671
there for 72 days there's an absurdity

3065
02:24:58,660 --> 02:25:02,710
of actually being him and the prevent in

3066
02:25:00,671 --> 02:25:04,330
prison because actually there's no

3067
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:07,689
reason if there's no real charge where a

3068
02:25:04,330 --> 02:25:10,061
person should be in preventive prison to

3069
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:11,740
justify its prevent imprisoned

3070
02:25:10,061 --> 02:25:14,320
Ecuadorian government have actually

3071
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:16,301
shown his devices his laptop his USB

3072
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:17,860
drivers his Jubba keys as evidence as he

3073
02:25:16,301 --> 02:25:19,960
was actually trying to hack into some

3074
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:21,700
system and as we know as people who

3075
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:23,439
actually attend the CCC that's actually

3076
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:25,330
very upset because we all have a lot of

3077
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:28,000
devices and that's no evidence that we

3078
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:29,761
commit any kind of crime as evidence the

3079
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,980
quaternion governor has also shown that

3080
02:25:29,761 --> 02:25:34,841
he had a lot of English books regarding

3081
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:38,289
programming and that was actually

3082
02:25:34,841 --> 02:25:39,971
something that they show us evidence so

3083
02:25:38,290 --> 02:25:41,410
what's the current state as I said he

3084
02:25:39,971 --> 02:25:43,770
was detained in a to a Latin American

3085
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:45,551
prison he was imprisoned for 72 days

3086
02:25:43,771 --> 02:25:46,961
after we did

3087
02:25:45,551 --> 02:25:48,430
an obvious corpus he was actually

3088
02:25:46,961 --> 02:25:50,740
released but that doesn't mean the

3089
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:52,540
persecution has stopped because actually

3090
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:57,369
he's still under investigation for at

3091
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:59,141
least 132 days 32 days 32 more days was

3092
02:25:57,370 --> 02:26:00,940
added into his investigation because

3093
02:25:59,141 --> 02:26:03,671
they decided to link someone else to his

3094
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:07,150
case so the political persecution can

3095
02:26:03,671 --> 02:26:08,830
continue so why should we care because

3096
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:11,320
this is actually that can happen to

3097
02:26:08,830 --> 02:26:12,820
anyone who works in their research we

3098
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:14,020
work in the area of research with

3099
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:16,240
privacy security and cryptography

3100
02:26:14,021 --> 02:26:18,551
because this is a misunderstanding from

3101
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:20,801
there from any government on the type of

3102
02:26:18,551 --> 02:26:23,740
field work that we do because this

3103
02:26:20,801 --> 02:26:26,529
actually makes our field look like we

3104
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:29,141
only do some crimes but not the kind of

3105
02:26:26,530 --> 02:26:31,601
research on actually protecting people

3106
02:26:29,141 --> 02:26:34,330
and protecting we're human rights

3107
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:36,461
that's why should we care so what can we

3108
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:38,289
what can you although as a community you

3109
02:26:36,461 --> 02:26:41,289
can retweet with a hashtag viola beanie

3110
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:42,971
you can also donate in GoFundMe page

3111
02:26:41,290 --> 02:26:44,891
that I didn't put here but if you want

3112
02:26:42,971 --> 02:26:46,900
to know exactly the page come talk to me

3113
02:26:44,891 --> 02:26:48,910
you can visit the website for your lab

3114
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:50,320
in e dot org you can talk about it and

3115
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:51,881
you can engage in any kind of way

3116
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:53,501
possible international pressure is

3117
02:26:51,881 --> 02:26:56,020
something that can definitely help in

3118
02:26:53,501 --> 02:26:57,730
this case and with that thank you very

3119
02:26:56,021 --> 02:26:59,051
much you can follow me on Twitter and if

3120
02:26:57,730 --> 02:27:00,699
you want to know more information you

3121
02:26:59,051 --> 02:27:02,650
can find it under the Twitter and we

3122
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:05,711
would probably do a session on one of

3123
02:27:02,650 --> 02:27:07,301
the workshops someday so we'll put on my

3124
02:27:05,711 --> 02:27:16,180
Twitter profile if you're interested

3125
02:27:07,301 --> 02:27:19,811
thank you bring to my program so the

3126
02:27:16,181 --> 02:27:26,711
next talk Oh Staniel rather securing

3127
02:27:19,811 --> 02:27:29,789
server-side scripting so everyone so I

3128
02:27:26,711 --> 02:27:32,141
wanted to talk about how to secure and

3129
02:27:29,790 --> 02:27:34,870
potentially untrusted scripts that run

3130
02:27:32,141 --> 02:27:36,820
on an enterprise application server in

3131
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:39,311
also critical environments so the

3132
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:41,561
company I work for has as customers the

3133
02:27:39,311 --> 02:27:44,289
big energy companies who run the

3134
02:27:41,561 --> 02:27:46,961
electrical grid and they somehow like

3135
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:48,700
security even though they want to do

3136
02:27:46,961 --> 02:27:50,971
something with the loads of data they

3137
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:53,801
produce so they need some some very

3138
02:27:50,971 --> 02:27:57,311
sophisticated reporting things and want

3139
02:27:53,801 --> 02:27:58,880
to plug in as deep as possible so they

3140
02:27:57,311 --> 02:28:01,399
actually require access

3141
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:03,979
- internal API of the Java enterprise

3142
02:28:01,399 --> 02:28:06,220
application server that you run so we

3143
02:28:03,979 --> 02:28:08,539
provide groovy scripting on the server

3144
02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:11,330
provided by the users who work in the

3145
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:15,830
back office to produce all kinds of

3146
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:18,260
extensions so what they typically do is

3147
02:28:15,830 --> 02:28:20,979
something like this so you iterate

3148
02:28:18,260 --> 02:28:24,140
through all the dates of the last month

3149
02:28:20,979 --> 02:28:26,599
get some data from the internal API and

3150
02:28:24,140 --> 02:28:28,820
do something sensible with it like

3151
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:33,080
checking whether the measurement is

3152
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:36,529
below some limit or so yeah but it is

3153
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:38,270
really secure obviously not if you can

3154
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:41,680
just try the script like this that that

3155
02:28:38,270 --> 02:28:45,620
terminates the the whole server so

3156
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:47,330
blackout so this would be a denial of

3157
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:50,840
service but you could also think of

3158
02:28:47,330 --> 02:28:53,000
attacking confidentiality so here you

3159
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:55,580
would bypass the privilege system by

3160
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,800
just getting every privilege because you

3161
02:28:55,580 --> 02:29:01,520
have access to this API and then you

3162
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:04,369
read any data and if you think of just

3163
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:07,399
creating and network socket is as easy

3164
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:11,090
as this in this one line you can send

3165
02:29:07,399 --> 02:29:14,149
the data to some other place

3166
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:16,220
wait don't belongs you could also think

3167
02:29:14,149 --> 02:29:19,070
of the other way around manipulating

3168
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:22,220
data attacking integrity so like here

3169
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:26,360
setting some value to 1,000 times the

3170
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:29,630
limit okay looks looks not so scary but

3171
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:31,700
you if you remember I said this software

3172
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:34,789
is potentially running the energy grid

3173
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:38,090
of Germany so this is blackout for

3174
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:42,170
everyone not so good so the idea is to

3175
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:44,689
restrict to a secure API where we know

3176
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:47,030
that that all classes and methods are to

3177
02:29:44,689 --> 02:29:51,260
be used are really secure and safe and

3178
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:53,000
we cannot bypass authorization so but

3179
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:56,090
how to do this so the user could still

3180
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,800
access the full API and the idea is to

3181
02:29:56,090 --> 02:30:02,000
use a library called groovy sandbox so

3182
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:04,759
essentially it allows you to restrict

3183
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:07,850
the runtime what what kind of imports

3184
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:10,130
you use but then you ask imports so why

3185
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:10,550
do I need this so I can do everything at

3186
02:30:10,130 --> 02:30:12,199
runtime

3187
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:12,710
everything's evaluated at run time if

3188
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:16,340
you

3189
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:18,609
to script so for instance you just

3190
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:21,740
assigned variable and you can't

3191
02:30:18,610 --> 02:30:24,050
efficiently detect this aesthetically so

3192
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:26,240
you can also use some some shortcuts on

3193
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:28,519
convenience methods and the only

3194
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:32,150
solution can be to intercept everything

3195
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:34,340
like this at runtime so the idea is that

3196
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:37,310
this groovy sandbox library allows you

3197
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:39,770
to attach interceptors at runtime that

3198
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:42,560
intercept every method call array access

3199
02:30:39,770 --> 02:30:43,970
object creation is cetera et cetera

3200
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:46,279
and then you would check against the

3201
02:30:43,970 --> 02:30:48,769
white list of allowed classes and

3202
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:51,760
methods and at best you're also

3203
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:55,010
blacklist what's not to be used ever

3204
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:58,670
likely using a class loader or opening a

3205
02:30:55,010 --> 02:31:01,750
network sockets also you also have to

3206
02:30:58,670 --> 02:31:05,240
consider a lot of hard cases that

3207
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:07,790
convenience methods in a language like

3208
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:10,910
Ruby brings like for instance you can

3209
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:13,460
just convert some string to a process

3210
02:31:10,910 --> 02:31:16,340
execution so in this one line you could

3211
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:18,830
just start an additional web server so

3212
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:23,479
you have to consider these these kinds

3213
02:31:18,830 --> 02:31:25,490
of vulnerabilities too and also you have

3214
02:31:23,479 --> 02:31:29,210
hard cases where you have a script that

3215
02:31:25,490 --> 02:31:31,160
just runs forever and what to intercept

3216
02:31:29,210 --> 02:31:35,539
here so there is no method call there is

3217
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:38,300
no variable access nothing at all so the

3218
02:31:35,540 --> 02:31:40,490
only possibility here is is to put this

3219
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:44,390
in a further sandbox run it in a

3220
02:31:40,490 --> 02:31:46,460
separate thread and I'd kill that if if

3221
02:31:44,390 --> 02:31:51,859
it takes too long so how do you kill

3222
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:54,859
threads in Java I'm not sure so the

3223
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:56,870
thing is there's this one method that

3224
02:31:54,860 --> 02:32:00,020
has been deprecated for over 20 years

3225
02:31:56,870 --> 02:32:03,050
and and all guides on how to do Java

3226
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:05,210
program we say don't use it but this is

3227
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:08,050
actually the only thing to do to kill

3228
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:10,550
something that is just not responding

3229
02:32:08,050 --> 02:32:13,250
okay thank you

3230
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:15,349
if you have any more questions or ideas

3231
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:17,660
so you can talk to me you can reach me

3232
02:32:15,350 --> 02:32:21,580
by mail or here at the camp in the

3233
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:21,580
village faking business route

3234
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:29,460
thank you thank you thank you very much

3235
02:32:26,029 --> 02:32:32,520
thank you thank you the next the next

3236
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:35,130
the next talk is going to be hold by BMC

3237
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:37,439
fun and is handling the two topic of

3238
02:32:35,130 --> 02:32:40,099
documenting proprietary BMC Hardware

3239
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:40,100
have fun with that

3240
02:32:40,909 --> 02:32:51,420
hi I'm going to talk about bmc's so what

3241
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:53,279
are beam sees it's it means base board

3242
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:56,040
management controller it's a bit of a

3243
02:32:53,279 --> 02:32:57,689
weird name but it's the server inside

3244
02:32:56,040 --> 02:33:01,439
your server that controls things like

3245
02:32:57,689 --> 02:33:05,810
power on power of keyboard video mouse

3246
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:08,399
and serial over LAN and often it has

3247
02:33:05,810 --> 02:33:10,698
direct memory access to the host system

3248
02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:13,470
so to your server which runs

3249
02:33:10,699 --> 02:33:17,220
applications or whatever and should

3250
02:33:13,470 --> 02:33:21,869
usually stay secure so it has a lot of a

3251
02:33:17,220 --> 02:33:27,239
lot of power over the system like

3252
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:31,859
examples include I lo from HP Enterprise

3253
02:33:27,239 --> 02:33:35,369
or I drag from Dell this kind of thing

3254
02:33:31,859 --> 02:33:40,319
we're talking about this the security is

3255
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:44,300
usually a bit questionable you have web

3256
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:47,489
servers in there doing string copy and

3257
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:51,390
scanf without a limit and that kind of

3258
02:33:47,489 --> 02:33:56,250
stuff and ipmi the the most popular

3259
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:58,890
protocol used to access BMC's is kind of

3260
02:33:56,250 --> 02:34:00,930
designed in the 90s and the

3261
02:33:58,890 --> 02:34:05,069
authentication is a bit questionable by

3262
02:34:00,930 --> 02:34:07,790
modern standards so usually you know

3263
02:34:05,069 --> 02:34:09,750
from from SSH there's public key

3264
02:34:07,790 --> 02:34:14,180
authentication and stuff and I don't

3265
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:17,569
think that's in IPMI and usually the

3266
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:20,279
firmware for BMC's is proprietary

3267
02:34:17,569 --> 02:34:20,609
sometimes there are open source parts in

3268
02:34:20,279 --> 02:34:23,000
there

3269
02:34:20,609 --> 02:34:27,680
often there's Linux in there but

3270
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:31,170
everything else is usually proprietary

3271
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:34,641
so a year ago I decided to do something

3272
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:39,021
about this and I got myself

3273
02:34:34,641 --> 02:34:41,330
this board it was cheap and it has an

3274
02:34:39,021 --> 02:34:43,730
eye load chip in the middle there's a

3275
02:34:41,330 --> 02:34:47,271
lot on there but there's interesting

3276
02:34:43,730 --> 02:34:49,761
part is in the middle that's a custom

3277
02:34:47,271 --> 02:34:55,511
chip from HP which implements all the

3278
02:34:49,761 --> 02:35:00,410
the ILO functionality it's an arm SOC so

3279
02:34:55,511 --> 02:35:03,440
you can just use GCC and put code on

3280
02:35:00,410 --> 02:35:05,450
there and fortunately for me the

3281
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:07,940
bootloader is not signed so you can

3282
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:10,431
actually just write your own code on the

3283
02:35:07,940 --> 02:35:15,650
flash and if the code is kind of correct

3284
02:35:10,431 --> 02:35:18,320
it will run and do things the bad thing

3285
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:21,619
is HP doesn't provide any documentation

3286
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:26,721
for how the ILO heart will actually

3287
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:28,190
works so I can't just go on and port

3288
02:35:26,721 --> 02:35:31,971
Linux because I don't know how the

3289
02:35:28,190 --> 02:35:35,750
hardware works so I started to document

3290
02:35:31,971 --> 02:35:39,109
how the hardware works with a bit of a

3291
02:35:35,750 --> 02:35:43,061
reverse engineering poking bits there's

3292
02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:46,040
now on github.com slash BMC fun a

3293
02:35:43,061 --> 02:35:49,221
repository with some documentation it's

3294
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:54,771
enough to boot Linux so I have timers

3295
02:35:49,221 --> 02:35:58,039
and the serial port and and Ethernet

3296
02:35:54,771 --> 02:36:00,891
also which is useful but none of the

3297
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:03,920
really interesting stuff like how you

3298
02:36:00,891 --> 02:36:07,971
control the hosts how you do power on

3299
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:10,280
power off and and all that and that's

3300
02:36:07,971 --> 02:36:12,740
still a lot to do I need more

3301
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:14,931
documentation for all the interesting

3302
02:36:12,740 --> 02:36:19,730
peripherals in there which would be

3303
02:36:14,931 --> 02:36:22,820
needed to make this actually useful you

3304
02:36:19,730 --> 02:36:24,680
can port your own operating system if

3305
02:36:22,820 --> 02:36:27,650
you're interested I'm just releasing

3306
02:36:24,681 --> 02:36:31,340
documentation for now so so it's a bit

3307
02:36:27,650 --> 02:36:33,500
of a white box reverse engineering thing

3308
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:37,370
where there's documentation and then a

3309
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:41,000
clean new implementation by the way I

3310
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:44,120
have one of these bots with me talk to

3311
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,780
me here if you're interested in getting

3312
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:52,229
it

3313
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:54,710
and from I love five they started to

3314
02:36:52,229 --> 02:36:57,449
sign the bootloader

3315
02:36:54,710 --> 02:37:00,869
but I'd really like to figure out how it

3316
02:36:57,450 --> 02:37:03,720
works exactly because I'm not sure it

3317
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:08,689
protects against everything that could

3318
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:08,688
be done to run custom code on there

3319
02:37:08,910 --> 02:37:16,080
there were a few groups of people who

3320
02:37:11,850 --> 02:37:20,100
helped along the way Airbus and CIN

3321
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:24,630
active released interesting research on

3322
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:27,540
vulnerabilities in Eylau the open BMC

3323
02:37:24,630 --> 02:37:32,160
project showed that it is possible to

3324
02:37:27,540 --> 02:37:35,880
run a BMC with fully free software

3325
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:39,210
deidre the disassembly and decompiler

3326
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:46,050
helped a lot and thank you for listening

3327
02:37:39,210 --> 02:37:49,769
go to this URL of the intercept thank

3328
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:51,720
you thank you thank you thank you thank

3329
02:37:49,770 --> 02:37:53,580
you very much the next talk is to hold

3330
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:55,679
by Master hippo and he is telling us

3331
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:56,399
something I like to do myself very much

3332
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:59,780
also

3333
02:37:56,399 --> 02:38:07,080
so it's called backstage penetration oh

3334
02:37:59,780 --> 02:38:09,600
thank you hello okay so where was this

3335
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:15,210
concerts in Italy its it was a huge

3336
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:18,570
concert and there were probably most of

3337
02:38:15,210 --> 02:38:22,979
the biggest artists biggest Italian

3338
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:25,800
artists in Italy there and I would it

3339
02:38:22,979 --> 02:38:29,250
was for 20th anniversary of a radio show

3340
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:33,479
and I really wanted to get into the

3341
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:36,240
backstage to meet my heroes so I started

3342
02:38:33,479 --> 02:38:38,519
thinking we went there maybe an hour

3343
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:41,880
earlier so I started thinking about how

3344
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:45,720
to get into the backstage there were a

3345
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:48,990
lot of a lot of security so I started

3346
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:51,688
thinking about how to get a badge so I

3347
02:38:48,990 --> 02:38:56,580
started taking picture with my brand-new

3348
02:38:51,689 --> 02:39:00,350
phone with superzoom to try and take a

3349
02:38:56,580 --> 02:39:03,359
good picture of of a badge and maybe

3350
02:39:00,350 --> 02:39:07,010
print it later maybe get out of the

3351
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:11,910
concert and get to close a print shop or

3352
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:15,450
or maybe next time get one of these

3353
02:39:11,910 --> 02:39:19,350
printers but it's pretty heavy it's hard

3354
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:21,830
to bring around it it's not very

3355
02:39:19,350 --> 02:39:26,160
comfortable to to have on your backpack

3356
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:29,390
during a concert but definitely this is

3357
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:35,100
a very good idea to bring one of this

3358
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:38,189
2-tone event and maybe you can also have

3359
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:40,470
some preparation before the event so I

3360
02:39:38,189 --> 02:39:43,380
didn't know about that didn't follow the

3361
02:39:40,470 --> 02:39:48,269
the social media of this event too much

3362
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:50,070
too closely but yeah why bother making

3363
02:39:48,270 --> 02:39:53,490
the effort to take a very good quality

3364
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:57,600
picture of a badge when there's

3365
02:39:53,490 --> 02:40:01,199
Instagram so thank you thanks to these

3366
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:05,399
artists or maybe even thanks to this all

3367
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:08,280
areas friend but posted this about two

3368
02:40:05,399 --> 02:40:10,410
hours before the concert started so you

3369
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:13,320
just have to bring a laptop maybe it's

3370
02:40:10,410 --> 02:40:15,060
comes from social medias and you will

3371
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:16,020
get a badge and then go somewhere

3372
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:18,960
imprinted

3373
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:22,470
but we didn't have the time we didn't

3374
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:25,108
want to go to the efforts to to crop it

3375
02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:27,029
to prepare it to print it we also had

3376
02:40:25,109 --> 02:40:28,960
almost half an hour before a concert

3377
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:34,270
started so we started looking around

3378
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:36,310
and well basically this is how it was

3379
02:40:34,270 --> 02:40:38,500
configured there was a main stage and

3380
02:40:36,310 --> 02:40:40,840
there was a big rail holding back other

3381
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:44,290
people and at the sides of a rail there

3382
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:47,350
were security guards looking at the

3383
02:40:44,290 --> 02:40:52,270
badges to decide who'd lateen and who to

3384
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:54,790
who cannot let him be a team and this

3385
02:40:52,270 --> 02:40:57,430
security guards are third parties they

3386
02:40:54,790 --> 02:40:59,649
are not from the same organization of

3387
02:40:57,430 --> 02:41:03,189
the concert so we don't really know

3388
02:40:59,649 --> 02:41:07,390
which badge is this night or whatever

3389
02:41:03,189 --> 02:41:10,739
the event is so they need something to

3390
02:41:07,390 --> 02:41:14,890
to check them against and on this rail

3391
02:41:10,739 --> 02:41:18,010
there was a need for paper a piece of

3392
02:41:14,890 --> 02:41:21,340
paper attached with the picture of all

3393
02:41:18,010 --> 02:41:27,540
the badges for them to easily compare

3394
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:27,540
and of course you can just take it and

3395
02:41:27,989 --> 02:41:35,500
rip apart one of the badges I decided to

3396
02:41:31,989 --> 02:41:36,369
be an artist both because I was kind of

3397
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:39,460
a con artist

3398
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:42,279
and because it didn't there were many

3399
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:45,039
many artist badges around so they

3400
02:41:42,279 --> 02:41:47,529
couldn't know everybody and also I used

3401
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:51,609
a piece of string from a gadget from the

3402
02:41:47,529 --> 02:41:55,720
gadget they gave away to make a necklace

3403
02:41:51,609 --> 02:41:57,489
so this was my badge I carefully I

3404
02:41:55,720 --> 02:42:01,679
didn't have knives or anything so I just

3405
02:41:57,489 --> 02:42:04,899
cut the paper and fold it on the back

3406
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:09,160
and yeah this is it

3407
02:42:04,899 --> 02:42:11,528
and I mean so I got in I'm at my

3408
02:42:09,160 --> 02:42:16,359
favorite artists showing proudly my fake

3409
02:42:11,529 --> 02:42:18,939
badge and I'd like to give you some some

3410
02:42:16,359 --> 02:42:21,550
take away that some ideas but I got from

3411
02:42:18,939 --> 02:42:24,430
this so the most important thing is to

3412
02:42:21,550 --> 02:42:27,550
look around to learn how people behave

3413
02:42:24,430 --> 02:42:30,310
to understand what everyone is doing to

3414
02:42:27,550 --> 02:42:32,729
see how they are interacting with with

3415
02:42:30,310 --> 02:42:35,970
the security and

3416
02:42:32,729 --> 02:42:38,010
and mimic what everyone is doing there

3417
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:40,229
were three important things the water

3418
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:42,840
bottle everyone in the concerts didn't

3419
02:42:40,229 --> 02:42:45,149
couldn't have a water bottle with the

3420
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:47,370
cap on so only people from a backstage

3421
02:42:45,149 --> 02:42:49,890
could have a cap on the bottle because

3422
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:52,140
all the bars were removing the the caps

3423
02:42:49,890 --> 02:42:54,569
before giving away the bottles so I had

3424
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:56,340
a cap on my pockets and I closed my

3425
02:42:54,569 --> 02:43:00,090
bottle to make it look like I was

3426
02:42:56,340 --> 02:43:02,430
backstage also the t-shirt they were

3427
02:43:00,090 --> 02:43:06,859
selling t-shirt like like people were

3428
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:06,859
like artists and as my face so good luck

3429
02:43:11,180 --> 02:43:18,620
thank you very much next on stage Stefan

3430
02:43:14,909 --> 02:43:27,289
Schindler would make rust fest of a more

3431
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:34,430
environmentally friendly canal

3432
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:40,470
wonderful it's this close enough okay

3433
02:43:34,430 --> 02:43:44,939
this close wonderful so welcome to my

3434
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:49,140
very spontaneous talk actually it's too

3435
02:43:44,939 --> 02:43:51,330
bright today so we have been looking at

3436
02:43:49,140 --> 02:43:54,330
multiple things at Russ fest we try to

3437
02:43:51,330 --> 02:43:57,659
be very inclusive but one thing we

3438
02:43:54,330 --> 02:43:59,909
noticed actually pretty late was we were

3439
02:43:57,659 --> 02:44:05,909
flying a lot of people over a lot of

3440
02:43:59,909 --> 02:44:09,779
places so what are we now we are looking

3441
02:44:05,909 --> 02:44:14,039
at the train map so next iteration will

3442
02:44:09,779 --> 02:44:17,729
be on Barcelona which is the I don't

3443
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:21,229
know flame-shaped thing on the bottom

3444
02:44:17,729 --> 02:44:23,970
left in in Spain and these are all the

3445
02:44:21,229 --> 02:44:29,460
connections we looked up for our

3446
02:44:23,970 --> 02:44:32,159
attendees and our speakers that are sure

3447
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:38,399
to work because there's no brexit or

3448
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:40,310
anything else strange happening so how

3449
02:44:38,399 --> 02:44:42,810
these are flipped

3450
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:46,949
Rasmus is a community conference like

3451
02:44:42,810 --> 02:44:50,330
camp as well and since you know climate

3452
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:54,330
change is happening and bad thing

3453
02:44:50,330 --> 02:44:58,890
all of these people had to go to Rome so

3454
02:44:54,330 --> 02:45:01,830
these are 400 people and yeah you could

3455
02:44:58,890 --> 02:45:06,210
fill a plane if they were from the same

3456
02:45:01,830 --> 02:45:08,880
city or it takes I think 50 planes for

3457
02:45:06,210 --> 02:45:14,819
all of them to get there so back to the

3458
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:18,869
map so we started with with these cities

3459
02:45:14,819 --> 02:45:21,420
to see if we can reach Barcelona in a

3460
02:45:18,870 --> 02:45:24,960
reasonable amount of time and it turns

3461
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:28,109
out we have a winner the longest route

3462
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:31,470
is from Oslo it takes almost three days

3463
02:45:28,109 --> 02:45:35,819
and it goes via coffin Berg so this is

3464
02:45:31,470 --> 02:45:37,590
the Purple Line so let me walk you

3465
02:45:35,819 --> 02:45:40,050
through it so worst case if you're

3466
02:45:37,590 --> 02:45:43,410
inside Europe you go from your city Oslo

3467
02:45:40,050 --> 02:45:46,108
to coffin pork and sleep there for a

3468
02:45:43,410 --> 02:45:48,210
night then you go from Gothenburg to

3469
02:45:46,109 --> 02:45:52,170
Copenhagen and Hamburg during the next

3470
02:45:48,210 --> 02:45:55,140
day and then go for I don't know go for

3471
02:45:52,170 --> 02:45:58,020
dinner then you take the night train

3472
02:45:55,140 --> 02:46:00,569
from Hamburg to Frankfurt to Basel 2:30

3473
02:45:58,020 --> 02:46:02,790
and arrive in the morning there you take

3474
02:46:00,569 --> 02:46:05,279
a shower go to a pre-event

3475
02:46:02,790 --> 02:46:07,260
and then in the afternoon you take the

3476
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:11,910
next train go to Geneva and then to

3477
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:14,370
Barcelona and there you go so it takes

3478
02:46:11,910 --> 02:46:19,550
you at worst two-and-a-half days to get

3479
02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:25,410
to Barcelona and back or or back sorry

3480
02:46:19,550 --> 02:46:28,500
so we are hoping that more people will

3481
02:46:25,410 --> 02:46:30,359
show up and say hey one of the routes

3482
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:33,030
pass through my city like Paris is a

3483
02:46:30,359 --> 02:46:35,180
good candidate that they will make a

3484
02:46:33,030 --> 02:46:39,720
pre-event so people will go there and

3485
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:42,540
join the ride which also means that if

3486
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:44,640
you depart together from the same event

3487
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:46,109
and go to the same next event you will

3488
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:50,570
ride together so you can have a hack

3489
02:46:46,109 --> 02:46:54,320
session in the train during the ride

3490
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:56,090
also the CFP is opened until the end of

3491
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:59,300

been working on with friends for some

3575
02:52:02,850 --> 02:52:08,460
years now and a great big story for this

3576
02:52:05,490 --> 02:52:09,690
project would be from working on Firefox

3577
02:52:08,460 --> 02:52:12,810
to bootstrap big development

3578
02:52:09,690 --> 02:52:16,440
environments so that the titleist of the

3579
02:52:12,810 --> 02:52:18,960
took so we are a small team working on

3580
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:21,930
this side project the main developers

3581
02:52:18,960 --> 02:52:24,270
this project is the young carer omnis he

3582
02:52:21,930 --> 02:52:27,420
worked at Mozilla when he first created

3583
02:52:24,271 --> 02:52:29,521
the project he was working on the rapper

3584
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:32,700
tools for Firefox and then he moved to

3585
02:52:29,521 --> 02:52:36,780
type Fox to walk on get put an IDE for

3586
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:39,000
get a bomb and I joined I joined on the

3587
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:42,150
writer for this project I am a sysadmin

3588
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:44,970
for a janitor and right now I work for

3589
02:52:42,150 --> 02:52:47,190
different networks which is an IT

3590
02:52:44,970 --> 02:52:50,490
security company based in Berlin and I

3591
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:53,660
also worked for cyber security club in

3592
02:52:50,490 --> 02:52:56,910
France where whose name is Academy and

3593
02:52:53,660 --> 02:53:00,360
also there are a lot there are some more

3594
02:52:56,910 --> 02:53:02,820
people who joined us on the ride and who

3595
02:53:00,360 --> 02:53:07,050
brought some features some cool features

3596
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:11,940
and some yeah some exciting features so

3597
02:53:07,050 --> 02:53:14,759
what is janitor why janitor we we

3598
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:17,850
realized while working on Firefox you

3599
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:20,100
can't directly work on Firefox and put

3600
02:53:17,850 --> 02:53:22,200
some enough some contributions Lundy

3601
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:24,570
directly in Firefox you need first to

3602
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:27,090
download gigabytes of stuff like cloning

3603
02:53:24,570 --> 02:53:28,650
the repository and unloading with your

3604
02:53:27,090 --> 02:53:30,930
package manager some dependencies

3605
02:53:28,650 --> 02:53:33,510
configure these dependencies if it's not

3606
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:36,060
emoticon automatically done configure

3607
02:53:33,510 --> 02:53:38,640
the tool chain and read some

3608
02:53:36,060 --> 02:53:39,270
documentation to know about the workflow

3609
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:41,160
and so on

3610
02:53:39,271 --> 02:53:43,650
and you have to do this again and again

3611
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:46,740
if you switch from one devices to

3612
02:53:43,650 --> 02:53:49,289
another if you switch from one operating

3613
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:51,720
system to another you will need to maybe

3614
02:53:49,290 --> 02:53:55,500
learn our way to pass on you new

3615
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:58,710
operating system and if you are just

3616
02:53:55,500 --> 02:54:00,570
curious about about learning about some

3617
02:53:58,710 --> 02:54:02,490
projects you will need to read

3618
02:54:00,570 --> 02:54:03,600
documentation for some project just for

3619
02:54:02,490 --> 02:54:07,439
basic

3620
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:09,739
for basic commands so with Janet oh we

3621
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:13,189
wanted to get rid of all of that and to

3622
02:54:09,739 --> 02:54:16,260
let newcomers and developers focus on

3623
02:54:13,189 --> 02:54:17,670
coding and launching features so if you

3624
02:54:16,260 --> 02:54:20,300
want to either look right now it's

3625
02:54:17,670 --> 02:54:23,580
available at Jenny Tata technology and

3626
02:54:20,300 --> 02:54:26,009
because I wanted to play it safe I'm not

3627
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:30,300
doing a live demo I will I have it on

3628
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:33,359
flights now so Jen Ito you can create

3629
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:35,938
containers to work on projects right now

3630
02:54:33,359 --> 02:54:38,790
we have 15 supported projects from

3631
02:54:35,939 --> 02:54:41,790
Firefox to chromium Thunderbird and so

3632
02:54:38,790 --> 02:54:45,600
on Hugh work in private containers

3633
02:54:41,790 --> 02:54:48,390
you've which come fully pre-configured a

3634
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:50,819
full check out of the source code and

3635
02:54:48,390 --> 02:54:55,050
these containers are ready in two

3636
02:54:50,819 --> 02:54:57,420
seconds and powerless you get access to

3637
02:54:55,050 --> 02:55:00,599
a web IDE and to terminal and to a

3638
02:54:57,420 --> 02:55:02,939
terminal this terminal get all the

3639
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:06,449
latest tools like get with the latest

3640
02:55:02,939 --> 02:55:07,859
version GCC and so on you get a full

3641
02:55:06,449 --> 02:55:09,689
check out of course as a source code

3642
02:55:07,859 --> 02:55:12,899
you've got some smart and parts to get

3643
02:55:09,689 --> 02:55:15,330
you running faster and on your local

3644
02:55:12,899 --> 02:55:16,710
machine I guess and you get those so

3645
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:19,409
studio access so if you want to install

3646
02:55:16,710 --> 02:55:21,390
soft winds or container you can you also

3647
02:55:19,409 --> 02:55:24,510
get access to web preview if you want to

3648
02:55:21,390 --> 02:55:26,300
try out some web projects and you get

3649
02:55:24,510 --> 02:55:29,580
access also to remote desktop

3650
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:33,590
environments if you want to run a just

3651
02:55:29,580 --> 02:55:36,479
compiled version of Firefox for example

3652
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:42,000
basically how it works behind the scenes

3653
02:55:36,479 --> 02:55:44,250
we we need the docker file which we're

3654
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:47,310
working from the docker file based

3655
02:55:44,250 --> 02:55:49,290
okafor which will be open today and then

3656
02:55:47,310 --> 02:55:50,609
from this docker file you will check out

3657
02:55:49,290 --> 02:55:53,060
the source code you install your

3658
02:55:50,609 --> 02:55:55,619
dependencies and then that's done it's

3659
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:59,399
it's ready to be put on Jenny total

3660
02:55:55,619 --> 02:55:59,819
technology so for this project what's

3661
02:55:59,399 --> 02:56:02,670
next

3662
02:55:59,819 --> 02:56:04,739
first we want to update we want to

3663
02:56:02,670 --> 02:56:08,850
update the projects to be much more

3664
02:56:04,739 --> 02:56:11,640
fresher and we want to and we want to

3665
02:56:08,850 --> 02:56:14,250
lend some new features we want also to

3666
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:15,390
have some more workflow integration so

3667
02:56:14,250 --> 02:56:16,860
you spend less time reading

3668
02:56:15,390 --> 02:56:18,330
documentation for Bay

3669
02:56:16,860 --> 02:56:20,101
she commands and you spend more time

3670
02:56:18,330 --> 02:56:22,950
reading documentation for complex stuff

3671
02:56:20,101 --> 02:56:24,990
which is great we want also to add new

3672
02:56:22,950 --> 02:56:27,271
localhost to the cluster so we can

3673
02:56:24,990 --> 02:56:30,119
welcome know more people and more

3674
02:56:27,271 --> 02:56:32,460
projects we I want to add life

3675
02:56:30,120 --> 02:56:35,610
collaboration feature which would let

3676
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:38,400
you work with people in the same

3677
02:56:35,610 --> 02:56:42,540
container as the same previews and web

3678
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:44,250
preview or same remote desktop and if

3679
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:46,620
you want to have your project adenine

3680
02:56:44,250 --> 02:56:49,551
generator it's possible it's possible
