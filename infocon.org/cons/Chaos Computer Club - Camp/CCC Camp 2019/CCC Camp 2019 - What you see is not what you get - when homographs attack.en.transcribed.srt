1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:16,450
[Music]

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:19,240
you'll fart who is going to be talking

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,380
to you about user interface security and

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,380
homographs attacks

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,250
hi everybody thank you very much for

6
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,260
coming to the talk I know it's pretty

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,519
late but yeah we appreciate the fact

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,410
that you guys made it so here is a quick

9
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:43,290
intro about myself like my name is

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,029
Joseph art director of professional

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,129
services and partner at blazed for me

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,820
security but yeah let's just move on

13
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,099
make a quick intro about the talk so

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,500
since the introduction of Unicode in in

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,320
in domain names so a series of security

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,899
implications have like appeared came

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,259
along as well so the presentation aims

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,700
to discuss some security risks around

19
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,970
internationalized domain names and how

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,850
applications such as browsers or email

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,759
clients and like secure messengers as

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,669
well they fail to handle ID ends in a

23
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,759
secure way and end up exposing users to

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,420
a necessary security risks and by making

25
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,860
it very easier to for phishing attacks

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,920
and visual spoofing to materialize so

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,220
here's a quick agenda about the talk so

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,210
we start presenting like speaking about

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,700
internationalized domain names how they

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,190
work how they could be registered and so

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,430
on and we move on to talk about

32
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,270
homographs

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,340
and associated security risks that come

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,470
along with them and then we explore how

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,870
user agents in this case like browsers

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,330
and major clients and so on how do they

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,850
react to homograph attacks and later

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,950
also show some practical attacks against

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,630
some of them and how we can also defend

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,440
ourselves and then we're gonna end up

41
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,000
like wrapping up the talk afterwards so

42
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,389
yeah now we're going to speak about

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,110
internationalized domain names and the

44
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,518
emergence of the ID ends so essentially

45
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,950
the internet was never designed to be

46
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,920
multilingual so it was created for

47
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,060
mostly United States using ASCII

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,099
characters so that is like Latin

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,560
characters and domain names have always

50
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,569
been confined to be Latin based

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,220
characters as I just mentioned

52
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,798
however like there are billions of

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,690
people that do not have Latin based

54
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,300
languages as the first language and

55
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,760
kind of the way internet worked I mean

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,040
that's actually mainly still works it

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,950
somehow excludes the fact that like

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,299
these people use what we would like to

59
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,690
use their own language they don't offer

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,150
that to both express themselves in the

61
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,970
Internet

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,460
and because of that like I can ended up

63
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,800
coming with resolution collect there was

64
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,660
like a version of the internationalized

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,670
domain names that eat ended up giving a

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,370
lot of support I got this white support

67
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,920
to to Unicode like this was like around

68
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,490
some two decades ago and the support for

69
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:24,130
Unicode like because Unicode it ended up

70
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:27,040
uncle different languages that like say

71
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,140
Cyrillic alphabet like some Russian for

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,810
some really old ancient European

73
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,609
languages and so on so this is why I

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,070
like they decided to go with Unicode for

75
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:40,410
that but then we have a little technical

76
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:43,299
problem when when winning like ended up

77
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,270
implementing ideas and the main

78
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,940
technical problem here is that DNS and

79
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,800
like as you guys know very well DNS is

80
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,100
like the some of the building blocks of

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,440
the internet and it's only ASCII so it

82
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,650
doesn't really speak unicode and because

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:04,320
of that so they come up like with a

84
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:08,160
different like way to make this blue and

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,140
and the fact they come up with this

86
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,459
company called Punic code so pinnacled

87
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,500
essentially converts Unicode to ASCII

88
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,738
and then for example it converts this

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,660
emoji of this nice little call here WS

90
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:25,719
which by the way it is actually valid

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,920
domain this actually exists to X and - -

92
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,770
and something nice like that or OBB dot

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,720
eighty which is the train company from

94
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,890
austria so this also gets translated

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,780
into inter Punic code in order to DNS to

96
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,030
actually work with that and then the

97
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,739
user interfaces will do the user

98
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,880
friendly part of things and will convert

99
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,440
back and forth and ID ends in Unicode

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,980
just long allows for things like this

101
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,990
there's

102
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,950
like poop la this actually this actually

103
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,500
also exists this is like a poop emoji

104
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:02,349
and domain name I will see later on like

105
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,100
about some rules around that and or I

106
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,720
love tacos

107
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,190
these also exist to again with an emoji

108
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,650
or completely full

109
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,230
Cyrillic domains including even the

110
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:18,880
top-level domain which is by the way the

111
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:21,280
full version version of Yandex and it's

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,450
called also like a foo IDN as we're

113
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,940
gonna see later on in the talk yeah I

114
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,920
said actually it came much faster than I

115
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,860
actually remember it so this like

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,440
partial id ends so OBB dot eighty which

117
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,540
means that there is some international

118
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,300
as the characters here like this oh with

119
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,080
the double finger on the top dot but the

120
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,550
TLD is eighty so you use the Latin

121
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,039
alphabet whereas we have this full ITN

122
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,990
ones which in this case I don't know

123
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,050
Russian so I don't know how to pronounce

124
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,350
that but this points to the Kremlin

125
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,840
official website so now we're moving on

126
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,760
to homograph and talk about security

127
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,590
risks and some considerations associated

128
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,360
to it

129
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,310
so latin script for example it can

130
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,160
represent more of variety of languages

131
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,850
it can represent for example Portuguese

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:21,490
Spanish English like Italian French and

133
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,990
a bunch more and then also the fact that

134
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,570
I would like to speak about is that

135
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,150
different scripts they share numerous

136
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,650
characters that either looks exactly

137
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,750
similar or have a very strong

138
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,820
resemblance so what I want to explain

139
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,230
here is for example there are like some

140
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:41,460
characters say a in Latin the Latin

141
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:45,180
script that it has a very very strong

142
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,070
resemblance to something very similar in

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,300
Cyrillic or in the Greek alphabet and

144
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:54,040
order the alphabets out there so and

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,880
they're called confusable homographs

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,380
as we can see here like the first part

147
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,360
of things like the number one is

148
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,479
actually Latin and this is the Unicode

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,460
code point of it

150
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,210
and the second one is the one in

151
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,150
Cyrillic and even if we zoom there's a

152
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,318
lot it's very very hard to distinguish

153
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:21,089
them from a visual standpoint there is

154
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:24,029
also an O in Latin and there is all with

155
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:26,460
a horn but also in Latin so even the

156
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,589
same language and the same script has

157
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,888
some characters that they look alike a

158
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:34,259
lot but yeah I mean we zooming in here a

159
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,509
lot so you can see the actual horn in

160
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,430
the O but with a very small screen and

161
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,150
depending on the font this can be

162
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:47,180
actually very hard to tell

163
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:50,099
also we have here P and P in or

164
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,199
something like that in Cyrillic like I'm

165
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,839
apologies for those that actually speak

166
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,289
Russian I probably didn't really speak

167
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,849
it properly there is also like and the

168
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,449
list goes on and on like this is the

169
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:06,419
most dismal C and in Coptic which is I

170
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:10,529
don't even know which language this has

171
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:13,318
something very similar and also in

172
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:16,169
Cyrillic so like you can go to like to

173
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,599
graph Emeka which is cool it's coming

174
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,099
next like yeah so graph M cocom there is

175
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:25,050
pretty much like a whole list of

176
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,310
different Unicode code points and

177
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,249
symbols and so on and you can actually

178
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,039
find many of them that are confusable

179
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:34,279
with watching characters so now we're

180
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,929
moving on speaking about user agents and

181
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,630
homograph attacks and how they handle it

182
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,760
so for twitter ization in visual

183
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,198
spoofing is our next topic they're like

184
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,329
a bunch of important factors that we're

185
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:50,160
going to see in the next upcoming slides

186
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:52,529
so these attacks they're mostly they

187
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,930
happen a lot because of few important

188
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,939
factors so the way the font is actually

189
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,500
ranked rendered into this place so

190
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:04,800
display size font size and they all play

191
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,810
a role in fooling a user actually into

192
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,750
believing that domain that he is

193
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:13,260
visiting or clicking is not a legitimate

194
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,970
one so as we can see here like using the

195
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,939
font to home our 68 point

196
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,029
in Latin Apple calm and there is using

197
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,430
apple with Cyrillic confusable there is

198
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,240
absolutely no way to distinguish this

199
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,609
from visual standpoint so even if we use

200
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,180
another font like Bookman old style

201
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:38,540
70-point we can see that there is a

202
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,170
little thing off between the L and the

203
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,810
the order L for Apple which is actually

204
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,599
not an L is it's just a capital I but in

205
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,880
Cyrillic and there are other fonts that

206
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,100
they actually do a better job at making

207
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,230
these things distinguishable as you can

208
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,060
see here the one Siri like is pretty off

209
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,070
so you can actually tell there is

210
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,650
something dodgy is something fishy going

211
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,700
on and this is actually like well now

212
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,439
we're talking about like it usually

213
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,890
agents so in this case like secure

214
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,540
messenger applications wire for for

215
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,860
desktop this is like the example here

216
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:18,170
and telegram so I zoomed in as well like

217
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,339
some four hundred four hundred percent

218
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,689
and you can see that in here like so but

219
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,120
actually I have to explain a few things

220
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,040
before so I reduce it like here I think

221
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,010
they used to be Nokia Maps or something

222
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,709
like that so I reduce it like a full

223
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,230
Houma graphic version of it in in

224
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:38,959
Cyrillic for like as part of research

225
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,550
for this talk so I was doing all the

226
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,010
stands and so on with some of these

227
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,959
domains that I actually owned and by the

228
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,450
way I'm actually happy to give them back

229
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,520
to here like if they are interested

230
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,270
because all of the research is very much

231
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,900
gone by now

232
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,959
so yeah let's go back here so this is

233
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,230
the legitimate one and the homograph one

234
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,029
how wire renders them you can see that

235
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,040
pretty much everything is exactly the

236
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,890
same there is just something off in the

237
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,180
AR but this is because we zoomed in a

238
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:12,830
lot like four hundred four hundred

239
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,739
percent actually so like very much like

240
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,360
five times as much any telegram some

241
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,150
characters as well like for example the

242
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,310
H is a bit off in this particular case

243
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,170
but then we as we'll see later there are

244
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,760
some characters that are completely

245
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,760
indistinguishable to

246
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:36,440
yeah so this is actually the telegram

247
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:39,859
with iOS as well and wire so just yeah

248
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,840
let's move on with with this so

249
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,730
essentially uh we we're talking about

250
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,400
this like as I mentioned er I can't have

251
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,680
this resolution backing twenty years ago

252
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,470
or so when they come up with it but then

253
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,930
they realized that there were like a few

254
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,410
Falls in the way they were actually

255
00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:00,319
allowing people to reduce your domain so

256
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,640
essentially it was possible to they do

257
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,010
you realize that oh there is this

258
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,330
confusable homograph thing and this is

259
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,450
actually can be a problem so it means

260
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,180
that people can register like google.com

261
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,580
with the say the e that looks like the e

262
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,109
from the one in Cyrillic and then that

263
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,690
would be all that would be very

264
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,140
complicated to actually slow down these

265
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,320
attacks

266
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,939
so in this run in these lines we're

267
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,470
talking about some of the rules around

268
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,590
the registration of homograph domains

269
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,930
and they vary a lot depending on the

270
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:33,290
top-level domain registrar as well so

271
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:36,050
for example the dotnet comm dot TV and

272
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,230
so on they allows different scripts from

273
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,930
many languages so you can see like

274
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,520
little notes Portuguese Romanian

275
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,760
Javanese Thai and like all these

276
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,400
characters for example and a few others

277
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,970
are more permissive like WS dot T oh I

278
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
think not

279
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,810
la you can even come up with emojis even

280
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,300
though I think if I'm not mistaken the

281
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,560
RFC doesn't allow emojis to be there but

282
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,920
well it's not the first time that people

283
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,079
don't really follow RFC's as they should

284
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,560
and for example like Doc Berlin Latin

285
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,590
and Cyrillic scripts are only the ones

286
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,420
that gets a lot so some of top-level

287
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,860
domains there are actually a bit more

288
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:17,599
restrictive than then then orders so

289
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,030
yeah as I said like in the version one

290
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,560
it allowed mix it scripts and then they

291
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,000
realize well this is actually security

292
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,310
problem and there will be a lot of

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,010
trouble in the future with that and I

294
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,079
think like opposed mm oh yeah a couple

295
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,170
of years ago there came up like a few

296
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,690
other versions of this resolution called

297
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,640
mode version 2 entry that they

298
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,610
disallowed Mixit scripts however pure

299
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,670
scripts are still completely fine to

300
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,190
register and now that we see here so all

301
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,560
these examples here like PayPal Apple

302
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,210
Opera and so on they're all homograph

303
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,790
domains that actually could be

304
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:57,250
registered because there was no way to

305
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:00,589
stop from registering pure script

306
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:04,400
homographs and like many others list

307
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:06,950
goes on and on and on so now we're gonna

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,540
see some actual practical attacks like

309
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,150
see how this is actually gonna build up

310
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,360
into actual computer security problems

311
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,000
so the practical attacks like the very

312
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,470
first time this even before IDN was

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,730
actually reintroduced by econ and even

314
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,470
before all this

315
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,320
internationalized domains were even a

316
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,420
thing so this was like back in 2001 the

317
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,770
two Israeli researchers they said how

318
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,660
old this is actually gonna be a security

319
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,340
problem and the original paper is very

320
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,439
interesting is very short like only I

321
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,240
think two or three pages and like I

322
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,540
totally recommend the rate to understand

323
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,980
more about this issue but only lately I

324
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,740
think like the past couple of years

325
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,860
especially this year it has been picking

326
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,660
up a lot and phishing like all these

327
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,290
features and other different are diverse

328
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:57,650
areas are now notes in this and we are

329
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,270
seeing a rise in research attacks and

330
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,610
like I think it's also very important to

331
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,050
speak briefly about some historical and

332
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,820
recent bugs related to homograph so

333
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,219
Firefox

334
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:14,270
like back in 2005 the dye phone Erik

335
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:16,580
Johansson from Shenmue group he filled

336
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,069
in a ticket with within Firefox like

337
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,840
with both the bugzilla saying hey like

338
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,920
you guys are not doing anything to

339
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,940
prevent such attacks

340
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,370
this was actually unfortunately taken as

341
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,320
a p3 importance bug even though I think

342
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,300
it should be it's actually definitely

343
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,890
something there should be higher but

344
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,079
like so this was like a video spoofing

345
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:39,470
the URL bar that we're gonna see some of

346
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,080
this a bit later than the talk recently

347
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,140
there have been like a few CVS like one

348
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,860
for Safari that this letter called doom

349
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:51,290
it was interpreted exactly as like it's

350
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,180
like a Latin letter from most some some

351
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,399
language that nobody probably even speak

352
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,160
more but still like isn't the script of

353
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,110
Latin script and then we was rendered by

354
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,219
Safari was just purely renders adi

355
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:10,500
instead of this doom also just recently

356
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:13,230
in 2009 thing that was 1k in Cyrillic

357
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,959
that was interpreted at actually actual

358
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,540
K in in ASCII and there was also this

359
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,849
research by well I don't know I cannot

360
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,560
speak the guy's name and saw her here

361
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,300
that he also found like different

362
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,630
vulnerabilities in the way Chrome

363
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,630
Firefox and and a few other browsers I

364
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,420
think Opera as well how they reacted to

365
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,930
these kind of problems and and as a

366
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,670
response chrome at least came up with an

367
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,670
improvement in their algorithm to detect

368
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,589
this confusable and like it's probably

369
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,140
like the best one that you have these

370
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:49,200
days and like again like there are a few

371
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,089
tickets open in the bugzilla of our Fox

372
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,339
they treated these are P three

373
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:57,540
importance again whereas Chrome treaters

374
00:16:53,339 --> 00:17:00,750
P one and as tor browser is also based

375
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,130
on Firefox but even Firefox it it means

376
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,079
that is also vulnerable and

377
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,400
unfortunately I don't know why but

378
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,919
beautiful tone browser they could just

379
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,569
go and fix this thing but they claim

380
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,480
that they are waiting for Chrome I'm

381
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,909
sorry for Firefox to know what you're

382
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,319
gonna do an upstream in order to finally

383
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,199
fix it I don't think is actually very

384
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,240
acceptable excuse by anyways just my

385
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,819
personal opinion

386
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,429
so yeah the way browsers handle ID ends

387
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,770
so after this hama graphic attacks that

388
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:31,470
were published by by this chinese

389
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:35,160
research in 2017 chrome stepped up the

390
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,790
game big-time like mad props for that

391
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:43,250
and then Firefox also table browser

392
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:47,370
still like lagging behind but yeah like

393
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:49,860
the way that they handle ID and crown is

394
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,290
actually probably it has a little it has

395
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,750
a very complex policy that seems to do

396
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,000
very well like preventing these attacks

397
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,820
opera and brave I think they follow the

398
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,800
same the same algorithm does chrome when

399
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,639
I was doing tests that's what it seemed

400
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,918
to me at least

401
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,510
Internet Explorer surprisingly was not

402
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,070
really vulnerable to this thing like

403
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,539
this

404
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,090
probably the only class of bugs and

405
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:13,279
relics but it was never neural - whereas

406
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,250
Firefox and tor browser still are still

407
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,740
lagging behind as I just mentioned so

408
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,490
now moving on to email client and and

409
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,110
webmail

410
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,179
so this is what I call it the

411
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,840
backstabbing friend so for the sake of

412
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:29,120
user friendliness some web mails and

413
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,240
some email clients they convert that

414
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,289
puny code that we just saw like X and -

415
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,809
- and some weird order characters back

416
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:41,299
into Unicode like to make it user

417
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:44,509
friendly but very often there are no

418
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:46,700
checks for confusable for confusable

419
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:48,440
characters they are not made so as we're

420
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,840
gonna see here now with there is an

421
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,769
example there is a shemale so hush mayor

422
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:57,379
is like a secure mail provider and if

423
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,850
you really really zoom you're gonna see

424
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:02,600
like this is actually a domain that I

425
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:05,439
own as well it's kind of like a part of

426
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,750
this research of this idea and homograph

427
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,940
facebook with the something on top of

428
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,950
the k so if you just see like when

429
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,389
you're in your computer like it's as if

430
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,019
like there is some dirt on your screen

431
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:20,360
that's it you would just just pass as

432
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:21,259
looks to you as facebook.com/ and this

433
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,320
actually goes straight into your inbox

434
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,940
doesn't get flagged by anti-spam or or

435
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,980
anything go at least not with harsh mail

436
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,899
and with a few other services that that

437
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,250
I tested include some big ones that I

438
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,199
won't for another I cannot really speak

439
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,730
about now because they have not fixed

440
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,549
their data

441
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,120
also there is do actually even assign

442
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,379
the CVE

443
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,018
recently in roundcube so again I use it

444
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:47,899
my domain here comm there's like the X

445
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:51,529
and - - something if I send an email to

446
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:53,299
anyone are using round cube around cube

447
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:55,490
you just convert it back to make it user

448
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:58,730
friendly and it will appear as if it

449
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,019
comes from here calm again no checks and

450
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,549
nothing out something it's actually

451
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,070
don't keep is doing exactly what's

452
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,899
supposed to deliver email so it would

453
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,029
just go straight into your inbox but

454
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:10,100
then from a visual standpoint you're

455
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,139
gonna you can essentially spoof the

456
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,199
domain name where this comes from

457
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:18,070
and now

458
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,500
this how signal handled this news also

459
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:25,389
assigned a CV earlier this year so

460
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:28,120
signal both from for Android and Windows

461
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,370
were vulnerable to this so if you see

462
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,469
here can you spot the fake URL there is

463
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,469
actually no way to tell from a visual

464
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:38,350
standpoint signal for iOS for I don't

465
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,590
know why but it made the fact the link

466
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:44,139
that was homograph unclick abour so like

467
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,449
that's great for iOS it didn't work but

468
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,350
for the other versions they were

469
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:53,620
actually vulnerable telegram as well had

470
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:56,980
had the same issue and telegram actually

471
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:01,540
went even as far as making that you know

472
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,850
that quick preview of of this website so

473
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:08,260
using the fake one so you can we could

474
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:12,510
really make all of like a real very

475
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,610
convincing phishing attacks with that so

476
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,010
let's just like top actually a quick

477
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:22,600
demo here with homograph attacks with

478
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:29,320
signal and tor browser i hope the video

479
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:32,310
alright so by the way these issues were

480
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,810
fixed by signal a couple of months back

481
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,980
also actual telegram fixed it for a

482
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,360
while but since that they just

483
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,060
reintroducing it when I was checking

484
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,500
things for the talk this week and it

485
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,810
seems like it went back so some

486
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,760
regressions would not really done

487
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:49,480
properly well yeah let's see the video

488
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,330
here the attack so yeah this is a fake

489
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,420
link of Apple calm totally cheat you can

490
00:21:52,330 --> 00:22:01,990
click and then the URL bar there is no

491
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:05,130
way to sell have to oh sorry

492
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,130
how to do that I don't know

493
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,470
all right sorry about that guys

494
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,020
so yeah back here to the video

495
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,750
yeah it's like fake Apple yeah the URL

496
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,149
bar would just display Apple and so on

497
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,730
and internal browsers new venerable to

498
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,390
this both like a mobile version and in

499
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:43,070
the in the desktop version so let's back

500
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:46,570
to all right I don't know how to use my

501
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,570
own computer and link I don't know where

502
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:59,510
that's actually shameful I need some

503
00:22:51,530 --> 00:23:02,480
help again I thought all right I don't

504
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,050
know to do oh yeah I need some help

505
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,050
again sorry about that

506
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,350
so yeah talking all about this hacking

507
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,580
and everything but yeah like some basic

508
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,580
stuff in the computer cannot do that's

509
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,590
pretty shameful alright so as we just

510
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,820
saw like these issues here and now I

511
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,689
think like it's very important to talk

512
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,070
about like how to defend yourself you

513
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,930
know honestly like for browsers

514
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,280
preferably just use a Google Chrome like

515
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,760
they're the ones actually putting an

516
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,810
effort in prevent such attacks and well

517
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,460
and also many other security relevant

518
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,710
stuff that chrome does so it's totally

519
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,140
worth it using it don't like a few

520
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,240
extensions developer third parties like

521
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,000
fished up AI is one of them that also

522
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,790
prevents and detects some attacks I

523
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,730
believe there are order order extensions

524
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,399
to that that will pretty much do the

525
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:55,190
same for Firefox you can actually turn

526
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,620
off the whole thing was shown in Punic

527
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:01,250
code to true so it means that you will

528
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,560
never show again all this the Unicode

529
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,890
thing will just show the actual Punic

530
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:09,620
code of it for email like a formally

531
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:12,980
tested Outlook protonmail tooten Alta

532
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,719
and are there fine or the popular ones

533
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,120
not so much as we just saw harsh mail

534
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,310
and there are like a few water

535
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,300
especially webmail providers that they

536
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:25,030
have not done any any work yet on this

537
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,020
even though like some of them actually

538
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,649
reported this as hey I think it's a

539
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,420
problem

540
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,550
some of them replied some of them not

541
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,070
some of them is lower than orders to fix

542
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,990
things and then again this is like

543
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,980
Chrome just introduced it I think like

544
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,410
month month and a half ago

545
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,980
so briskly chrome has a list of the hunt

546
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:45,780
like 10,000 most visited websites and it

547
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,910
will actually do some sort of work to

548
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,410
the attack like it looks like somebody's

549
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,100
trying to pull off a non-home graph

550
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:55,620
attack against against github and are

551
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,000
you sure you want to go to github.com or

552
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,239
to this thing that's dodgy and

553
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,240
somebody's trying to fish you and also

554
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,310
from a defense perspective from the

555
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,780
sorry from the human eye perspective the

556
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,720
were like a proposal that never will

557
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,060
took off that they wanted to have

558
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,690
different colors in the letters that are

559
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:18,480
not Latin alphabet so I mean the ones

560
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,100
that are plotted on fusable this never

561
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,640
really took off like it's probably not

562
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,919
that great from from a user interface

563
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,320
and user experience point of view and I

564
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,140
think that's why it never really picked

565
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,750
up momentum there are few developer

566
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,510
sorry application developers there are

567
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,820
like a few libraries that they check for

568
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:43,410
confusable so the they would just do

569
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:46,700
part of this of the heavy weight of for

570
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:49,440
you and now we are wrapping off the talk

571
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,150
so essentially a comfortable home graph

572
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,390
they have been a look around for a while

573
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,500
as we saw since some twenty years or so

574
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,200
since they're pretty much the very

575
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,670
introduction of internationalized domain

576
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,280
names by egg-cam

577
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,380
but very little has been discussed

578
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,160
around them and they very frequently

579
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,290
overlooked and these issues are not

580
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,680
really part of thread model for many

581
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,300
applications as they are very often

582
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,420
considered social engineering so

583
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,340
actually good luck for for you if you're

584
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,900
trying to submit something like this to

585
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,760
a bug bounty program many of them will

586
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,790
say hey this is social engineering

587
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,280
attack it's out of scope for for my

588
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,720
program but actually some of the secure

589
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,160
messages I actually got a bounty from

590
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,280
one of them that I didn't really mention

591
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,580
here because well it's part of we cannot

592
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,440
really speak about it that

593
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,080
but it's part of the bug bounty program

594
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,149
but I think was the only one that

595
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,499
actually gave a small reward for for

596
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,518
this kind of issue even though in the

597
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:47,659
very beginning they said it's not a

598
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:49,190
security it's not a security issue

599
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,749
because they're doing exactly what

600
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,549
they're supposed to do is to display

601
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:54,710
links but yeah it feels fling link of

602
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,629
Google and when I click there it takes

603
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,159
you somewhere else oh it's probably

604
00:26:56,629 --> 00:27:02,689
something off and ultimately I think

605
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,360
application security teams they keep

606
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:07,700
doing much more at being proactive in

607
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,619
preventing these strats like for example

608
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,460
Google Chrome is actually doing a pretty

609
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:13,639
good job with that

610
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,230
not only now recently showing to use

611
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:16,820
this interface of the user hey are you

612
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,090
sure you're going to direct correct

613
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:23,450
website and also improving their

614
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,820
algorithms to show the domain names and

615
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:29,450
whereas like many other softwares are

616
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,299
not actually doing it instead of asking

617
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,549
for users to be like vigilant and please

618
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:36,889
don't click on bad links or stuff like

619
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:39,200
that it was just not really an option or

620
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,059
even worse waiting for econ to come up

621
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,009
with a magic solution for the problem I

622
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:46,220
believe I remember that one of these

623
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:48,379
secure messengers when I report this

624
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,480
issue to them they said well this is

625
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:51,649
also another problem because we are

626
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,239
doing exactly what we're supposed to do

627
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:55,729
display links and this is a problem with

628
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:57,739
ICANN and registrar's we have like

629
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,139
trying to shift the blame no it's

630
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:02,090
actually it's not their fault is

631
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:05,209
actually the fact that you're not really

632
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:08,600
doing this thing correctly and here are

633
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:11,389
like a few references about about this

634
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,809
research I will recommend reading them

635
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:19,779
up if you're interested and yeah thank

636
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,779
you very much it's the question time now

637
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:35,199
thank you for the talk do we have any

638
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:38,188
questions from the room here on the

639
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:43,329
internet nope

640
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:44,829
wow this is really amazing so this I

641
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:46,959
hope I explained everything so well

642
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:48,309
there's no questions last yeah it kind

643
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:52,269
of seems like that there are no

644
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:58,509
questions unanswered on this amazing

645
00:28:52,269 --> 00:29:00,309
topic okay great then we'll wrap it up

646
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:03,090
and call it a night and thank you very

647
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:08,180
much and giving one more warm hand

648
