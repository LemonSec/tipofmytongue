2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,740
and I like to introduce ludica vice who

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,189
is a professor from Berlin and he wanted

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,820
to be announced like this and

5
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,550
sustainable blockchains

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,210
is the topic that he will talk about and

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,340
the subtitle of the stop is talked is

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,340
narrative blockchain sustained

9
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,559
sustainable blockchain to set off

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:47,280
digital and dirty

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:51,449
I feel feeling that implies the Munda

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,280
thank you one remark this headline was

13
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,789
not chosen by me by the german foreign

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,819
broadcasting station deutsche welle

15
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:05,400
someone it kind of teased me by saying

16
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:06,900
that if you google digital and dirty

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,159
you'll find this interview in

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,990
Deutschland funk and that is just one

19
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,729
from the bizarre features of the

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,079
blockchain world and like other topics

21
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:23,820
where people have a strong emotional

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:26,250
attachment there is a kind of funny in

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,038
be mild situation where all the people

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,719
that had a scientific approach to the

25
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:36,450
issue and weigh up the pros and cons

26
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,298
they are then invited by the pro and con

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,500
people to panels

28
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:46,530
it'll correct them one after the other

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:50,899
and they may then be facing attacks for

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,950
three opinions stapling forward but as a

31
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:55,170
scientist a computer scientist you

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,439
should case to keep calm and understand

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,890
the technology and that is surprisingly

34
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,178
simple when it comes to blockchain

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,619
because and that's why I started my

36
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:07,320
first slide we're saying simple and

37
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,199
older blockchain is a trained list of

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,440
blocks with hash pointers and that is

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,839
one of the most simple structures that

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,959
you can learn in one of the first

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,560
semesters in computer science

42
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:27,470
behind has a really introductory example

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:30,890
and that is quite interesting being one

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,489
thing that it can be explained in just a

45
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:38,720
few minutes of a lecture by mixing a few

46
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:40,549
other influences and and by mixing it

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,260
with some other influences it became in

48
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:45,069
very interesting technologies but as

49
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:50,870
computer scientists let's approach it

50
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:53,358
and think how you can establish a secure

51
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,519
ledger note-taking and that has been a

52
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:58,579
topic that's been debated in computer

53
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,970
science for a number of years one of the

54
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:06,500
and with finding papers that's always

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,959
quoted is from 1990 in the hacker on how

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,040
to timestamp a digital document and in

57
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,950
the hacker scene there are some

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,000
interesting experiments one is by Ross

59
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,629
Anderson from 1996 and even more I had

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,060
to smile when an old very old hacker he

61
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,948
was still he was already open I came

62
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,269
into the scene in 1990 that's not Donna

63
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:32,000
hacker he also produced a an eternal log

64
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,269
file and that must have had a strong

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,959
influence because the standard URL that

66
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:45,859
I have quoted here is old

67
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:49,099
assets that's how it starts and and

68
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:51,379
that's been around for decades and that

69
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:56,540
even the people that ran this have

70
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:59,929
always regarded this as an old issue no

71
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,819
burden and surprise then was that

72
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,549
Bitcoin developed so strongly later so

73
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05,899
what happened with Bitcoin from

74
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:10,540
literally nothing

75
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,769
suddenly there was a currency system

76
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,679
even to house person my mother said that

77
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:19,699
if you look at he's usually exchanged

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,820
forums and try to approach still there

79
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:26,659
is a three-digit billions of currency

80
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,219
units as strengths that Bitcoin has and

81
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:30,500
of course a lot of criticism has been

82
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:31,919
raised about the energy consumption of

83
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,169
that technology and one of

84
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,049
the decisions that led to the

85
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:41,998
decentralization of the system is often

86
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:45,509
busy and the software quality is a bit

87
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:48,360
Group growling if you look at it as a

88
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:54,499
hacker of course with you your judgment

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:57,629
is kind of strong tends to be and what I

90
00:04:54,499 --> 00:05:00,629
would summarize my comments as would be

91
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:02,310
please do it again properly and the

92
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,050
interesting thing is that some simple

93
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,539
some small decisions at the bit level

94
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,889
had strong social and economic

95
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:15,120
implications or in this currency system

96
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:21,300
now let's try to order the problems to

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,819
some extent and as the first and most

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,150
important issue I would raise data

99
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:30,469
protection Bitcoin isn't the fit coin as

100
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:34,349
a system little funds like to where

101
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:36,779
public transaction letter exists and

102
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:41,669
it's distributed worldwide so everything

103
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:43,770
is open and by definition even things

104
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:49,770
that are written into that cannot be

105
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,810
deleted so for all eternity in a sense

106
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,060
that you'll have to define sensibly of

107
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,740
course but it's all public open it

108
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,649
cannot be deleted there's no right to be

109
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,649
forgotten and if you look at if you

110
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:04,529
would make up a data protection

111
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,899
nightmare then bitcoin is quite an

112
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,939
interesting candidate you loyally did

113
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:12,810
this but now the people that defend the

114
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:15,379
system say well there are pseudonyms and

115
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,710
about that I have to say well that is

116
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:24,300
kind of deceiving as a sense of security

117
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:28,680
pseudonyms are the last line of defense

118
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,919
really and to some extent in some

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:39,870
aspects it is a deceptive kind of

120
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:42,120
descent I've just noted one item here it

121
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,399
can be attacked with simple graph theory

122
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,480
and even perhaps in quotes artificial

123
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,790
intelligence to add

124
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:55,680
the buzzword so you could look at the

125
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:57,240
whole transaction data and see if and if

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,130
I'm a bit eccentric the whole Bitcoin

127
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,450
transaction still fit into the RAM of my

128
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,560
computer so if you look at the whole

129
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:10,409
thing I am NOT looking exactly but they

130
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,930
grow at a somewhat comma a mild rate you

131
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,080
can almost have it all in RAM and then

132
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,850
run certain algorithms on it

133
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,060
another question then is how long will

134
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:26,070
they stay legal so the numerator even

135
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:30,750
the use of pseudonyms is doubted in many

136
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:33,120
areas in the world right now concerning

137
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,240
data protection it is problematic

138
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,270
another another interesting aspect is to

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,790
really consider what the philosophy

140
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:47,190
behind it is and that is quite

141
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:50,160
interesting because of course bitcoin

142
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,530
comes from a libertarian mind sets and

143
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,880
there are people who had called there

144
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,320
are called crypto anarchists or

145
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,630
capitalism anarchists is quite

146
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,570
interesting what mixtures of political

147
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,670
ideologies there are these days and the

148
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,800
debate whether these people are more

149
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,290
happy with or without a state in

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,420
particular without a strong state that

151
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,460
is one of the oldest philosophical

152
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,570
debates and that is a very interesting

153
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,950
debate as well which to sharpen one's

154
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,270
mind one really should get into and try

155
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,539
and understand the different positions

156
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,330
and make up one's mind about their own

157
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,950
position but we are all hackers

158
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,250
therefore we tend to say philosophies or

159
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,348
nice and good and but we have to produce

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,210
something to attack some some real

161
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,490
problems and the interesting thing is

162
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,410
with goodies when apart from the

163
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,940
question whether it's good whether if a

164
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,140
state does not exist anymore what do we

165
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,690
do in areas where there is no

166
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,900
functioning state what are the current

167
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,880
boundaries where there is no banking

168
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:56,709
reliable banking where there is

169
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,200
no state or social control about who can

170
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,470
actually join the game and that is an

171
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,950
interesting point must undergo calm that

172
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:10,510
simply got raised by a simple question

173
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:13,030
asking I am rather clear in my mind

174
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,970
that's an interesting there's no

175
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,140
community on from one computer

176
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,540
scientific point of view what's

177
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,010
interesting is that there are computers

178
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,959
communicating here and the question then

179
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,500
is who is allowed to use these computers

180
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,330
and is therefore and that is quite

181
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,300
strongly linked to the question of

182
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,840
access as a whole doesn't hold and that

183
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,000
is a debate where I at one point thought

184
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,410
well it might be surprising to some

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,450
people but love with Balu binds oh the

186
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,290
spread of mobile phones is about one

187
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:50,560
person on the planet at the moment when

188
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,900
it comes to bank accounts that is much

189
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,550
less accessible so it is an interesting

190
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:59,530
scenario where the possession of a phone

191
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,189
however however simple doesn't have to

192
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:06,400
be that smart but an SMS messaging might

193
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:11,050
be enough well that gives you an

194
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,949
opportunity of access and that from

195
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,660
abacus part of view was led to the

196
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,340
thought well yes it's discrimination

197
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,160
free everyone can use it and this this

198
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,540
hacker ideal is not just abstracts it's

199
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,850
not just important in an abstract sense

200
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,449
because there are enough countries where

201
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:33,880
for example women cannot open a bank

202
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:36,910
account without a male relation giving

203
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,189
consent or something so is this free of

204
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,839
discrimination but there is an

205
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,230
interesting dynamic then too because

206
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,730
also children gain access and that can

207
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,280
lead us to the debate oh great now

208
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,230
children have this freedom yes but you

209
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:55,480
can get the situation where people that

210
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,140
want to have weren't run businesses then

211
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,300
try to capture children and and and

212
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,650
empty their accounts by ringtone

213
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,430
subscriptions which happened in Kenya

214
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:09,829
what did the these nice abstract issues

215
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,540
is it does it make sense to give

216
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,950
children access to bank accounts that is

217
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,530
not an academic debate we have had

218
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:22,250
developments that even the Kenyan

219
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:24,500
government had to take note of still

220
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:30,590
this is a technology that in principle

221
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:34,840
allows access to anyone in my view it's

222
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:38,720
about awful and it needs to be shaped

223
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,070
and should be shaped on fire I can craft

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,620
of edom Inge

225
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:47,720
so this discrimination free property

226
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,030
that people creatures of all kinds can

227
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,480
have the key to an account that is a

228
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:58,760
small but not unimportant game-changer

229
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:03,860
in this area when were it's done from

230
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,810
now if you consider a smartphone in web

231
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,100
annoyed that that's even a non

232
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,510
smartphone gives people access then you

233
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,060
have had a very abstract level you can

234
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:18,350
say that possibly with blockchain in

235
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,750
digital giving unjust structures you can

236
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,970
build structures that have very few

237
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:27,290
requirements in the analog world and can

238
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:30,140
be used and that means that and there

239
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:34,010
are some interesting possibilities that

240
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:40,970
I would like to talk get into in this

241
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:43,340
talk maybe it the end of the talk a few

242
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,510
words on the things that I want to talk

243
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:53,470
about in this talk I talk about how we

244
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:57,550
can take an existing system and and some

245
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:01,040
reduce some environmentally damaging

246
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:06,339
aspects and I would I want also to

247
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:10,160
discuss and another system that has

248
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:13,760
different mechanics um

249
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,870
and I already talked talked about some

250
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,980
things at the last Congress

251
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:25,860
about using more intelligent mining

252
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:30,029
algorithms and and there were proof of

253
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,850
stake or proof of work systems that had

254
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:37,230
no energy consumption for the mining of

255
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:41,430
the coins and both things are being

256
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,640
researched and I already talked about

257
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,729
this at the last Congress and from a

258
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,040
hacker's perspective and we have

259
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,690
considered that we have the technologies

260
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,890
but what do we actually create with it

261
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:58,770
and if you look at the bank systems

262
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:04,470
there is not really an academic

263
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:09,360
discussion and if you take an Pisa which

264
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:16,650
started in Kenya which was a cooperation

265
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:18,210
with Vodafone and in many areas it was a

266
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,079
positive recept

267
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,550
the received very positively and so we

268
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,970
can see that there have been some

269
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:29,400
positive developments in these projects

270
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:35,070
but we still have to think critically

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:36,810
about these projects and and even in

272
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,910
these cases the government is actually

273
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:45,719
not opposed to these things and even

274
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:48,870
just these three things that I have

275
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:54,920
selected here bit drastic so even in the

276
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:59,760
poorest countries of the world there are

277
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:06,060
also you know in Kenya and the most

278
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,860
poorest actually have to boot and yes so

279
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,890
they still have to pay a transfer fees

280
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,910
which are considerable and if you think

281
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:20,760
about old mafia movies you know there

282
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:23,589
was the Mafia fees up for for keeping us

283
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:29,860
for staying protected against the Mafia

284
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:31,810
and says this is my grandson sir you

285
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,540
have to pay quite a lot of fees for

286
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:41,219
these things and at the same time you

287
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:47,319
have major wins and I am old enough

288
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:57,010
where there was no bad connotation of

289
00:15:47,320 --> 00:16:02,230
but it is simply not acceptable if the

290
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:05,950
poor have to pay fees of that amount of

291
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:10,810
that on that scale and if people that

292
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:13,540
just transfer micro amounts have to pay

293
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:18,790
the most that is simply not acceptable

294
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:22,870
that is rather indecent even so that is

295
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,630
an issue where you can argue yes even

296
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:30,490
small amounts cause effort but if you

297
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:34,839
have 27 percent profit and if you are in

298
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:36,190
a poor country then maybe you if we are

299
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,350
just talking sense

300
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:43,720
maybe just out of the goodness of your

301
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,970
heart you could waive those fees and

302
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,500
that's an appeal and me on dental but

303
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,240
people should not operate this services

304
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:59,230
just to optimize profit right and I've

305
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,800
also extended my talk at short notice by

306
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:07,349
adding this in May two thousand nineteen

307
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:11,079
concerning data protection inmate 2019

308
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:13,569
there was the so what is take a

309
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,329
protection we have now the issue that

310
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,099
these personal data with private

311
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,569
companies and of course we will say what

312
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,510
private companies have the secret

313
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,250
services have as well but then then

314
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,379
there is issue number two what the

315
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,390
secret services have hackers well

316
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:32,340
shortly afterwards have as well and

317
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:37,360
exactly that happened because in May

318
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:39,549
11.5 million records of users

319
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,740
were offered on the black market was

320
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:44,860
under them the interesting thing now in

321
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,490
this was well 11.5 million is impressive

322
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:53,350
enough but if you look closely then this

323
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:57,970
needle Eadie's just the noblest is the

324
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,980
most valuable data sets these 11.5

325
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,380
million are not just names and all kinds

326
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,770
of private land and security relevant

327
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:09,850
data this was done professionally these

328
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:13,200
are people that run gambling services

329
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,100
and betting services and there are lists

330
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,309
meet in saying what these what kinds of

331
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:26,799
transactions these people had made so as

332
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:30,549
I said if you just under name had done

333
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:34,240
if you for example register a betting

334
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,860
company according to the laws of the

335
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,140
German state of constant for example

336
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,250
then you'll have some interesting

337
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,500
opportunities there there it's not a

338
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:45,280
cynical remark it's just an analysis of

339
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,410
how things work so if these eleven

340
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,320
eleven point five million are just data

341
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,740
which is the the elite kind of the data

342
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,370
then let's just assume that these are

343
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:00,429
not the only data that have gone astray

344
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,110
if it's and may be much cheaper the

345
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:05,410
other thirty million could be bought for

346
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:10,620
a because they have just a peanuts so

347
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:14,260
the old dilemma if data are created the

348
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,449
private businesses will sell it secret

349
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,490
services will have its prosecution

350
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,860
authorities will have it but good or bad

351
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,020
news will however you want to see it

352
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,000
these data can then find their way

353
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,520
through some kind of channels I have a

354
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,250
certain value and not all hackers in the

355
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:36,780
world just dream about having badly paid

356
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:41,410
academia positions or runs nice

357
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:43,770
elimination in camps there are people

358
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,020
that want to make money out of these

359
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,960
activities and you have to assume that

360
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,950
there are people the skills that

361
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,810
get at the data and the usual hackers

362
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,930
saying well yeah data will always be

363
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:04,280
hacked sorry no with empieza we've just

364
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:08,580
seen it in May just a few months ago

365
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:12,389
normally so again the remark I need a

366
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,980
drink if he do not have data protection

367
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,180
friendly constructions then the data

368
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,430
will be gone and it goes stray and I I

369
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:24,330
doubt whether society is mature enough

370
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:26,820
to deal with the uncovering of all kinds

371
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:31,350
of data without severe disruptions

372
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,149
coming as a result and now since we are

373
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,490
at that point of course then that leads

374
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:39,840
us to something that's even more

375
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,960
interesting and Facebook Libre of course

376
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:47,419
some people in my surroundings got quite

377
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,560
enraged about this capitalists are now

378
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,650
capturing taking over immense the

379
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,720
Patriot technologies well yes as they as

380
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,550
it always happens and the situation of

381
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,550
course is what has to be told to the

382
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:02,480
capitalists soak up these movements do

383
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:06,510
come from an anarchic anarcho-capitalist

384
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,450
area so that is kind of that kind of

385
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,650
weakens the whole point anyway but now

386
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,000
let's approach it from a scientific a

387
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,390
neutral point of view technology

388
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,790
markets have a tendency to become aware

389
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,650
of technologies and try to make a profit

390
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:23,580
out of those not a surprising thing to

391
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:27,170
say and if there are ideas to run this

392
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,750
all democratically without banks without

393
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,490
services the service companies will

394
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,140
still look and see what they can use and

395
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:38,240
in the case of Libre what's very

396
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:42,480
interesting is if you take a step back

397
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,600
this truly is an attack but we are

398
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,640
didn't fear on one of the most valued

399
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,679
companies in the world

400
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,230
by one of the most values company in the

401
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,700
world which is Facebook to financial

402
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,710
services they are building a new

403
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:01,650
currency in the beautiful country of

404
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,590
Switzerland which which is covered by a

405
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,610
pool of currency

406
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,199
and there are players involved in in the

407
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,510
club well the membership of the club

408
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,779
costs 10 million I think

409
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:18,640
and then some people were then

410
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,610
calculating and said if they if Facebook

411
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,029
is if they have a 2 billion account on

412
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:29,260
Facebook and just 1% of the users take

413
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:30,820
part just to compare that with the size

414
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,890
of the largest German banks or the

415
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:38,799
international banks you can see where

416
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:40,809
this can lead to again without again the

417
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:45,220
debate of data protection whether it's

418
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:47,320
state or private actors the Facebook

419
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,500
median table you could say that this is

420
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,510
the worst of both worlds if your

421
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,580
Facebook will have the data they will

422
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,279
set it on they will have the connections

423
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,678
to secret services

424
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:02,500
remember MP so we've seen in the case of

425
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:07,750
MPs a Vodafone is not a small or medium

426
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:10,240
enterprise including Bentley if there

427
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,730
are eleven point five million premium

428
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,169
premium data sets then it's quite

429
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:20,080
unlikely that not all of the data has

430
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:22,029
kind of escaped the steam at well then

431
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,789
you know I wouldn't say that M Peter has

432
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:28,809
a system that only sees those premium

433
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:33,490
data sets I don't know I don't even want

434
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:39,700
to know but whatever explanation led to

435
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:41,500
this rich good good good unsettle parts

436
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,299
of the population to quote a former

437
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,070
German interior minister Thomas de

438
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:50,230
Maiziere now another issue that I would

439
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,408
like to add fairly simple thoughts but

440
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,520
in a hacker camp a camp is a good place

441
00:23:53,409 --> 00:24:05,860
to throw these points into the debate

442
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:09,629
again these are my protocols do mandate

443
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,629
further research because the

444
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:17,869
question of energy consumption

445
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,359
I can may be solved and but I would

446
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:22,100
point to my last Congress talk in that

447
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,070
regard but what I would like to say

448
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,918
again difficult about sustainable

449
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:31,700
development in blockchain I have two

450
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:35,019
ideas there and the one is what to give

451
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:38,210
and I've tried to use a defining word

452
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:41,239
infrastructure free mining in particular

453
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,580
mining with regenerative power sources

454
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:46,820
and there are some surprising properties

455
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,299
in the protocol that are somewhat

456
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:54,369
friendly towards solar and wind power

457
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:57,320
with and you should perhaps also dream

458
00:24:54,369 --> 00:25:01,779
to have the idea of self-financed Cloud

459
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,460
Servers by the by making the blockchain

460
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:06,559
conduct useful proof of work

461
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,879
calculations if you have countries with

462
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,639
a problem in their banking systems

463
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:13,189
problems in the computer industry

464
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:17,149
computer infrastructure why not combine

465
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:19,580
this of course this is not the hacker

466
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,379
spirits hackers just built something in

467
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,509
a weekend and a build a minor and then

468
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:25,668
and then just throw it into the desert

469
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:29,720
and and suddenly the whole world becomes

470
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:31,340
nice and comfortable but still a few

471
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,970
thoughts and maybe even calculations

472
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,678
should be made to that end now let's

473
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,139
look at return etre for how sources

474
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,039
regenerative energies and the

475
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:44,269
requirements of mining and mining

476
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:48,109
interesting it has a constant power

477
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:50,419
consumption there are these are far less

478
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:53,799
fluctuations of course they do exist but

479
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:57,919
the lift line had much less fluctuation

480
00:25:53,799 --> 00:26:01,309
even over a longer time scale then the

481
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,279
energy consumption of a modern social

482
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:06,769
economy right and Reagan into that

483
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,529
regard the options for regenerative

484
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:15,559
energy sources which always supply a

485
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:18,769
certain base need is there for them to

486
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,119
be used the option is there because this

487
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:21,739
really works with a constant power

488
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,629
consumption and that is a property that

489
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:29,310
solar and wind power have as well

490
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:34,080
by some one solar and wind power have

491
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:40,139
strongly fluctuating power generation

492
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:42,330
and people that in my early days nuclear

493
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,740
power interesting they thought it's

494
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,389
going to be so cheap that you don't even

495
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,100
have to have power meters anymore which

496
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,760
not wasn't quite realistic but I'm still

497
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,879
smiling

498
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,220
if you then let the engineers play

499
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,030
around a bit we happen to be in that

500
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,420
heart it's we then truly we did have

501
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:04,350
this situation that power wasn't just

502
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:08,960
free but even had a negative price while

503
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:12,530
legal cause as I said situation is that

504
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,770
we may have too much power in the grid

505
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:21,660
sometimes be it in and the idea then is

506
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:27,360
to maybe use the excess power directly

507
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:29,250
for mining the second issue is MST

508
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,820
tunnel it may be a bit of a course

509
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:37,320
analysis but good in a gear places

510
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,710
giving the good guy Agnetha that are

511
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,620
suitable for power generation mostly in

512
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,480
places where you don't you tend not to

513
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,419
want to live because there are storms

514
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,850
there there is too much Sun in so family

515
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,880
easily and therefore it's quite

516
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,980
interesting to say well maybe there are

517
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,980
places that have a lot of sunlight and

518
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,710
we can directly use that power but that

519
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,930
might be interesting but maybe but but

520
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,000
then how do we transport and store this

521
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:09,600
energy that is very very expensive

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,480
well and if you then as a hacker look at

523
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,219
the situation and say hang on how much

524
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,930
infrastructure do we need for mining

525
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,570
we'll hang tough not what properties

526
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:24,840
does this infrastructure have and the

527
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,220
interesting thing yet if you analyze the

528
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,480
mining system the interesting thing is

529
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:32,850
that some properties are not so apparent

530
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,390
mining pool for inflation one property

531
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,740
is that it is

532
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:41,050
the friendly for mining pools on Bitcoin

533
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,900
mining that my mother's if you describe

534
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,280
Bitcoin mining then you keep saying that

535
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,010
these are lottery tickets and you have

536
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,430
to calculate some random numbers but

537
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:54,910
well with ins are the law of large

538
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:57,190
numbers there comes into play if you

539
00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:01,840
have a system like Bitcoin which is

540
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:03,730
friendly for mining in pools then you do

541
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,230
not have to wait and hope for some

542
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:09,670
random lucky event you can use mining

543
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,030
results and have them delivered and

544
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:15,340
continue from them in Medan all right so

545
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:19,210
let's approach the idea of solar mining

546
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:21,490
mesh networks what requirements go and

547
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,250
mining to to participate in Bitcoin

548
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,320
mining I'll now use Bitcoin as the

549
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,980
leading currency used it as a

550
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:34,139
placeholder for all the others but and

551
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:36,190
we allow isn't Bitcoin allows this

552
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,650
situation is much better than you might

553
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:43,030
think and that gets us back to the

554
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:45,370
hacker idea man I in principle you can

555
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,550
set up a solar power station in the

556
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:51,000
desert throw it into the desert and as

557
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:56,260
an outside connection you need one

558
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,860
satellite connection if GSM exists which

559
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,420
in many situations let's take GSM so

560
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,909
this very abstract situation you just

561
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:11,170
throw one in computer into the hottest

562
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:12,940
desert where there is no where no

563
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,760
life-form would like to stay for any

564
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,730
extended amount of time establish the

565
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,320
satellite link power for the satellite

566
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:25,690
link we can generate as well the and

567
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,639
these are things where many people might

568
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,600
say well let's calculate if it's going

569
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,460
to be worth it

570
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,830
protection of all this but I would say

571
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,320
well yes you've understood we have to

572
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,030
calculate let's do this

573
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,830
let's calculate what is possible and

574
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:41,110
what is not I'm not saying that it can

575
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:44,260
solve the world's problems but this

576
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:45,870
basic idea in fact that we have a

577
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:50,100
situation

578
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:53,159
and he gets at them be quite fits the

579
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,290
model I've just set up it is quite

580
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,960
imaginable that we built solar mining

581
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:01,379
stations and put them into the desert

582
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:08,910
and and connect him to satellites and as

583
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:11,610
I said backers can dream for long enough

584
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,410
I have it's been thinking this through

585
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,689
to be able to say this is not an absurd

586
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:18,660
idea well Ivan first I have the rights

587
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:22,890
to have strange ideas but apart from

588
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:25,980
that I do really consider this something

589
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,770
way that you can think of and Paula Dean

590
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,309
armed at a on a net political evening of

591
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:34,470
the ticket ala gesellschaft I linked up

592
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:37,889
with someone from his solar generation

593
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:41,450
project he introduced systems where they

594
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:45,300
can have trucks with solar panels that

595
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:50,070
really went to African villages in

596
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:54,780
different African countries and supplied

597
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:57,210
services there and then they had so it's

598
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,760
still planning or being discussed how

599
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,820
they do the token system but there are

600
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:07,640
people working on it becomes part that

601
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:11,520
was quite impressive and I got to know

602
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:15,200
some other people and when I was invited

603
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:19,500
to a ministry and I'm a mathematician

604
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:24,360
and there were two nama sets really

605
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:26,550
moved me so so that the transaction fees

606
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:32,520
are really affecting the poorest of the

607
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:35,669
people and and 600 million people have

608
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:41,309
no reliable access to energy or power

609
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:44,760
and I have to say Lord and if you have

610
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:47,340
the then the your most radical idea is

611
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:53,570
that we give access to power to these

612
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:57,240
people and solar power is is something

613
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,780
very obvious because of the strong solar

614
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,700
and

615
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:07,270
radiation and something that I also

616
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:10,680
consider is and of course there is no

617
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:14,860
infrastructure in these places right now

618
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:18,100
and if we do it in places where there is

619
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:21,939
few population then you don't really

620
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:25,090
have much reliability and Eve and of

621
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,910
course we have people who just collect

622
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:33,879
scrap metals and who might scavenge and

623
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:36,550
whatever we drop there and and if we and

624
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:42,760
what we want to do is you see all three

625
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:49,980
free power to do the mining and exist

626
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:52,629
them and left and I have to say that

627
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:55,090
mining quit and if we only have like a

628
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:58,210
reasonable mining project that gives us

629
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:02,290
more solar power than and this is also

630
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:06,190
when and these are things where I say

631
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:08,500
let's just consider this reality don't

632
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:12,280
be too pessimistic about the rate

633
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,590
reality yes I know if we do the

634
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,659
calculations then it's turns out it's

635
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:22,870
not so easy on an economic level but

636
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:26,730
still if there are so many possibilities

637
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:31,569
and opportunities that are unused and

638
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:34,830
that will also heat up the planet then

639
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:37,960
if we could divert some of that energy

640
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:43,029
or heat then this is not a bad idea and

641
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:45,580
yes let's have some more ideas and if

642
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,730
you think about the calculations for the

643
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,340
if the bills for the mobile connections

644
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:56,730
you could pay these with the power that

645
00:34:51,340 --> 00:35:00,840
you produce and during the day you could

646
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:03,790
produce solar power and during the night

647
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:07,680
beside you could then take advantage of

648
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,680
the money that you've earned

649
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,030
and if we make systems more intelligence

650
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,899
then that's something worth thinking

651
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:23,570
about women and the other fundamental

652
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:26,780
approach is is that Bitcoin involves a

653
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,770
lot of efforts to do a lot of

654
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,920
calculations based on random numbers and

655
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:39,920
what I found interesting is an

656
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:43,010
alternative which is proof of space from

657
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,560
the and I think in the next couple of

658
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:50,060
weeks and months we will have some more

659
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:53,740
interesting results so for instance

660
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:57,440
there's parma coin which combines and

661
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:02,410
distributed storage with payment systems

662
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:05,450
and if you have and for the people who

663
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:08,720
evaluate economic success

664
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:11,089
they live in need of a girl but they

665
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,000
these are these people are willing to

666
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:17,990
pay for this

667
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,560
so the ICU managed so the ico for

668
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:26,930
Falcone managed to acquire a three-digit

669
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:30,470
mil millions fundraising coupons are

670
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:35,450
discussed and therefore I think that

671
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:38,779
young people can look into it and maybe

672
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:43,089
come up with some good ideas and I want

673
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:49,099
to give you the and overview again so

674
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:54,560
you get the consensus by by making

675
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:58,839
storage space available and consonance

676
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:03,230
field and if you want to combine

677
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:07,609
consensus with useful social and actions

678
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:09,170
and then everyone wins and if you if

679
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:11,660
yeah and if you combine these things

680
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:15,430
then you you become part of this reward

681
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:18,109
system instead of just randomly

682
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:20,149
calculating hashes you actually do

683
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:23,869
something worthwhile

684
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:27,640
with the energy meant you have more

685
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:31,150
influence on the system just by doing it

686
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,640
only minutes need yourself there and

687
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:41,450
become to be night I don't want to call

688
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:43,578
this a win-win scheme which be fat but

689
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:47,058
it would be quite annoyed if people

690
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:50,960
actually called it like this because

691
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:56,480
then the big countries would use more

692
00:37:50,960 --> 00:38:00,619
energy than smaller countries and one of

693
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,980
the promising and things that I've seen

694
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:07,150
is that we use regenerative energies and

695
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:17,029
let's combine these probability

696
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:20,150
properties and widens done and because

697
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:24,559
after the academia as I said will for

698
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:28,730
academia the we should mining scheme

699
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:31,089
some other will be a BTE direction and

700
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,349
we should try and find the community

701
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:36,529
Democratic approaches where we're all

702
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:39,230
which computer has a say and people

703
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:42,500
blame the workman and then trying to

704
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,970
purchase that often do not have the

705
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,420
energy problems and that will create a

706
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:50,089
new currency dynamic you know that is

707
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:54,740
the kind of research that I conduct but

708
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:56,509
today I wanted to place the focus on to

709
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:59,209
really hackable ideas and really invite

710
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:03,619
you to maybe take part

711
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:08,059
no matter now to summarize oh I forgot

712
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:10,250
this even stronger requirements of

713
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:12,710
stronger challenges are the privacy

714
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:17,119
challenges I had a talk yesterday

715
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:19,279
that's can I in building block sign beef

716
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,720
details in and out a certain form of

717
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:24,190
economy that could be a building block

718
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,189
and certain knowledge protocols

719
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:33,950
give this to ours now that surely yes ha

720
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,759
ha da is an interesting approach for

721
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:40,069
research to unfulfilled on in go hyah

722
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,640
lutely conduct some mathematically

723
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:44,920
challenging and useful research so again

724
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,589
protecting privacy

725
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,510
dr. Mann tomorrow requires very well

726
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:53,089
thought through mathematical ideas so

727
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:56,980
all the mathematicians are invited to

728
00:39:53,089 --> 00:40:00,380
take a deeper look and then I said

729
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:05,270
proper cryptography as I said we should

730
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:07,849
consider do we want people with with a

731
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:12,020
lot of money enter the system and create

732
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:14,299
a lot of generate lot of co2 which on

733
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:18,589
the other hand would stabilize the

734
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:21,380
currency that may sound horrific but if

735
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:26,390
you approach it cynically you could say

736
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:28,849
that the co2 generation is quite

737
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,220
strongly correlated with the value of

738
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:34,609
the currency so cynically said if you're

739
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,558
ready to to burn this and that amount of

740
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:39,200
power for Bitcoin than it is worth

741
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,290
something to you my only thought is you

742
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,480
shouldn't forget that either

743
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:48,440
the large power consumption does mean

744
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:52,690
that Bitcoin even against state attacks

745
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:56,780
has a certain amount of resistance and

746
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:59,180
resilience and a lahar we are the people

747
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:03,200
that pay for hardware for mining

748
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:07,129
bitcoins of this new gift and the moment

749
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,808
they use a technology in processor

750
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,569
building but I'm going to be mean now

751
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:14,180
but technologically they're quite in the

752
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:17,420
middle between Intel and AMD I think

753
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:20,839
they have fine structures than Intel

754
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,839
these days lately so in that regard it's

755
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:28,279
quite interesting mathematical mind and

756
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,779
of course also in offense to the

757
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,240
mathematics community because

758
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,860
mathematicians always search for prime

759
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:40,310
numbers was interesting properties and

760
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:43,320
a wholly failed brain coin system which

761
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,630
had as a proof-of-work search for prime

762
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,440
numbers the fact that this failed so

763
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:52,020
badly or at primatech hidden in desire

764
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,370
even though it found chains of prime

765
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,170
numbers with interesting properties

766
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:59,160
better than indeed scientific community

767
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:01,830
had the fact that this failed is a kind

768
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:06,000
of denigrating to the mathematics

769
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:07,980
community agnostic and supporters you

770
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,510
have people playing with this and

771
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,220
producing nicer results than the

772
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,370
scientific community had and then it

773
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:17,250
failed but that's not a very rare thing

774
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:20,900
in the cryptographic community now last

775
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:23,580
slide to point out the positive sides

776
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,610
regenerative energies have a number of

777
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,410
properties ticket Allah be upon the

778
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,600
digital currencies have a number of

779
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,569
properties that go very well with

780
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,130
fraternity of power generation

781
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:40,320
generation that can go very well with

782
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:42,150
grassroot economies and it is inland let

783
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,810
me say like this if we build this in

784
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,290
countries we should try to the bow get

785
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:52,049
privacy inserted as quickly as possible

786
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:53,820
to do it right the options to go back to

787
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,150
the MPs are example that was very

788
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,570
successful

789
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:03,990
our often criticized justify Utley

790
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:06,960
justifiably but yes a mandala darkness

791
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,189
if you accuse these people of collecting

792
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,930
all the data and not protecting and

793
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,310
property properly and then the responses

794
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,140
Secret Service's have the data anyway

795
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,850
but the problem is if Secret Service's

796
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,970
have it a few days later the hackers

797
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:20,400
have it people by a thousand frog we now

798
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:24,540
have the proof on the black market so if

799
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,480
we roll out something then please Who

800
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:31,050
theme deed that used systems that are

801
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,870
compatible with GDP are sorry that was

802
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:38,250
very mean I had to insert an artistic

803
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:40,380
interlude here but joke aside the GDP

804
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:43,350
are with all justified

805
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:46,260
correct and sometimes too exaggerated

806
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:48,710
criticism starting point does provide an

807
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,860
interesting starting point and

808
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,890
that there again yeah but protecting

809
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:59,330
privacy in transactions is not an

810
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:07,129
esoteric hobby for some people that want

811
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:10,610
to show that there are not it's not

812
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,650
about the head of the rocker club hiding

813
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:16,100
the fact that he collects Barbie dolls

814
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:19,310
no this is about very sensitive data

815
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,430
that is out there in the market and it

816
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,799
is nineties one 11.5 million data sets

817
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:29,690
can easily be converted into the threat

818
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,370
mails and blackmail and very simply

819
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,880
experiment that I can run on these data

820
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:37,069
and just if you just think for a couple

821
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,570
of hours you can write a few Python

822
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,580
scripts that can create an enormous

823
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,680
amount of unrest so my appeal to

824
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:46,250
politicians is don't believe that

825
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,069
society has matured enough we out begin

826
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:53,300
where to make the protection of private

827
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:57,950
data obsolete ballistic if by writing a

828
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,480
small strip I can be a bother all these

829
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,439
people that have been involved in

830
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:06,440
gambling sorry Lord if you're thinking

831
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,790
of 11.5 million people's and you then go

832
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:13,010
oh oh and just one thousand one per mil

833
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:18,140
would then respond to blackmail that

834
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:20,150
would generate a lot of money to open a

835
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,370
group took of me research about

836
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:24,410
sustainable cryptography let's look at

837
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,270
the research there here are some

838
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,910
interesting ideas there and I said that

839
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:32,180
data protection should be at the very

840
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:35,149
base of it and that is work for everyone

841
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,669
mathematicians should think about zero

842
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,020
knowledge quality and computer

843
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,180
scientists should start implementing

844
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,950
these out protocols and we should all

845
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,379
work together and and talk to each other

846
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:48,439
and try to make technology better thank

847
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:53,750
you thank you very much

848
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,530
miles or ina yes a perfect landing Rudy

849
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,860
thank you

850
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,540
now sustainable blockchain instead of

851
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:06,800
digital and dirty now this is your

852
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:08,930
applause now unfortunately there is no

853
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,910
time for Q and a because you really used

854
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,910
all his time but you know how he looks

855
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,620
now he will use one of the exits because

856
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:18,520
that's the only way he can leave the

857
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,520
tent so glad

858
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,079
[Music]

859
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,299
you
