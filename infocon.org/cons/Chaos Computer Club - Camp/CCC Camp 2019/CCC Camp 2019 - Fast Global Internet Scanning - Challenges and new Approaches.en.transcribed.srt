2
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,150
internet scanning or how to become your

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:29,659
isp please give a big round of applause

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:30,229
to Joanna streak can you Kenny audience

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,090
it's perfect

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,010
yeah welcome to the talk first Internet

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,039
scanning challenges and new approaches

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,468
or how to become your own RSP my name is

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,570
Johannes click I'm concentrating on

10
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,239
internet scanning and my second favorite

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,310
topic is industrial control system ot

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,470
hacking have discovered in the past

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,540
several her abilities industrial control

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,839
systems and fire vaults are protected

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,600
exam and also have given some talks to

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,840
pH days that's Russia and in blackhat us

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,309
USA about how to find industrial

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,590
controls on the internet and then to

19
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,798
compromise them and also I did some

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,840
publications on academic conferences

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,869
like the ACM internet measurement

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,060
conference so what is the motivation

23
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,729
first to talk how to set up an

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,969
infrastructure for scanning the Internet

25
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:24,020
repeatedly so my problem was that showed

26
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:26,329
an IO is does not provide raw data for

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,670
free and as a researcher you are very

28
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,499
interested in raw data because you

29
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,229
cannot be sure that maybe comprehend

30
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:36,619
stated or manipulated data you will get

31
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:39,139
and the next problem is children IO had

32
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,179
does not provide clean snapshots of the

33
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:43,158
Internet this means they're scanning the

34
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:44,899
internet but they are not deleting old

35
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,840
results they are putting every time

36
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,639
newer results into it and it means that

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,499
if you have and you think on dynamic IP

38
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:54,229
addresses you will have the same server

39
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:56,298
twice or whatever however multiple times

40
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:59,658
in the database this means you have no

41
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:01,399
real clean data census is very good also

42
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:04,669
academic projects or in the past now

43
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,810
they got startup but they also since

44
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:08,389
they're in our startups they are not

45
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,280
providing the raw data for free and they

46
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,859
also have some inconsistencies in the

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,740
database I will show later and the next

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,530
point is you need to think about that

49
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:24,130
people or the persons that are running

50
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:27,010
these platforms they know what are you

51
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,690
looking for and the question is what are

52
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,640
doing what are they doing with the

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,440
stator and the next question is who

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,200
might be interested in this data right

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,190
so that's why I better to to scan on

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,929
your own the Internet

57
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,079
here a good example from show down here

58
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,570
you can see for talat the children says

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,480
you have appropriate five million telnet

60
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,890
hosts you're looking on sensors they say

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,220
our it's a properly Laurens

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,769
approximately 3.1 million and also our

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,600
own scans show that we have 3.1 million

64
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:00,280
tenant house from the internet if you

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,530
there you can see that children has much

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,750
more systems in the database course by

67
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,180
the dynamic IPS and not providing clean

68
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,710
snapshots can source ain't in it that's

69
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,420
why if you're clicking on children on

70
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,830
some host you see very often that they

71
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,119
are not reachable and so on you may be

72
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,120
know it when you're working with show

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,330
down on a next point here you can see

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,360
inconsistencies on sanz's on the left

75
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,960
side you can see I look for please give

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:29,050
me the number of all HTTP host that has

77
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,120
reported and responded on port 443 on

78
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,690
the right side I did this similar

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,940
request

80
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:38,170
I said please provide me all holes that

81
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:41,770
had given you on via HTTP 54 for 3 a

82
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:46,630
status code status code is that 200 ok

83
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,430
or 400 for 315 and it's and you need to

84
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,160
get a status code for a full handshake

85
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,690
on HTTP so both requests should result

86
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,510
with the same number but they are

87
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,960
different you see on the left side you

88
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,000
have 41 million on quite the equal

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,800
request you have 35 million and there's

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,240
a big difference it shows there's some

91
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,090
inconsistencies and that's why I cannot

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,060
use these data for my research and I

93
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:13,150
have not enough know the raw data access

94
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,040
and that was my final motivation there

95
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,160
was the first quarter of this year there

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,899
was a new project called packet L packet

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,760
on are some researchers said yeah

98
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,979
there's no raw data we were scanning the

99
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,750
internet just using masking it's getting

100
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,750
the internet from one single source IP

101
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,280
and doing it in a time span of two hours

102
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,740
and then we are providing the easy data

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,330
for all for free and then they got some

104
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,370
problems with spam hoes because spam

105
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,580
house is rarely crazy they have a lot of

106
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,890
black hole IPS on the internet and then

107
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,719
if you say receive one or two sincere

108
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,610
say oh you're a really really bad

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,020
partner you're you're malicious whatever

110
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,790
and then you're putting it on understand

111
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,150
list and the block list and so on and

112
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:56,270
their problem run packet tongue because

113
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,070
there is there is a there is preset on

114
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,260
our here your butcher private we will

115
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,599
cut your virtual private server because

116
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,820
you're going to get you have you cannot

117
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,060
scan anymore and there were also some

118
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,330
first of stories about packet tell and

119
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,440
then they try to make spam house angry

120
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,380
and in the end Brian

121
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,710
traps talks them and then they stop

122
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,850
their service very funny story okay so

123
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,010
this talk is about how to set a so how

124
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,620
to set up an infrastructure for long

125
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,000
term repeatedly scans I'm very

126
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,070
interested in the distribution of

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,990
vulnerable or exotic network services

128
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,080
for instance like industrial control

129
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,550
systems or building management systems

130
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,130
in the internet or was the time of

131
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,890
different autonomous systems or BGP

132
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,960
prefixes and this talk will explain how

133
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,900
to set up this framework in the first

134
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,080
50% we will talk about the setup itself

135
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:55,789
and the next 50% we will talk about the

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,370
results of our scans so what is history

137
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,800
first tribe was like every other body

138
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,620
has this year probably in the room just

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,180
taking a fast gunner and running and

140
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,160
running it on the internet from a single

141
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,110
source IP but that's a really bad idea

142
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,600
you will get blocked very first and we

143
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,010
receive a lot of abuse messages and a

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,560
virtual private service provider will

145
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,490
kill your service and you are not lucky

146
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,830
in see at second try just rent like 20

147
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,530
virtual private servers for 4 to 10

148
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,260
years Mark's per month maybe globally

149
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,179
distributed the results might be getting

150
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,219
better because you're using more source

151
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,290
IP addresses but nevertheless you have a

152
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,140
lot of big problems of abuse messages

153
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,150
because 0 so your service provider will

154
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,830
receive abuse messages they say all your

155
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,940
malicious you're infected we have to

156
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,800
kill yourselves please clean

157
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,410
please clean your virtual private server

158
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,350
or you will get kicked out like see

159
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,590
pecker tell guys the third try was to

160
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,750
rent at slash twenty nine from an isp to

161
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,969
get your own who is DB entry with your

162
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,440
own abuse mail contact then we thought

163
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,480
okay we are lucky not everything will be

164
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,670
fine but the problem was that these

165
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,770
automated IDs intrusion systems they are

166
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,070
not only reporting to the abuse mail

167
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,620
dead standing the u.s. entry they are

168
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,320
also sending messages to the maintainer

169
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,570
of the IP address block this means your

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,440
direct RSP and then we got the same

171
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,969
problem that said he that our I speak or

172
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,610
the forms that we are malicious we have

173
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,950
a botnet and whatever and then we got a

174
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,390
lot of trouble yeah well in the end we

175
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,039
we managed a lot of abused messages on

176
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,080
our own but in the end it was too

177
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,620
complicated to get in some discussions

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,930
with the RSP sir the final solution is

179
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,810
we got our own ISP

180
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,150
so we become a rhyme Bama a rap member

181
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,420
and get our own autonomous system a

182
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,719
complete slash twenty two networks this

183
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,950
means 1024 IP addresses signup fee is

184
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,090
approximately two thousand euros

185
00:07:52,950 --> 00:08:00,180
membership membership fee is like about

186
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,909
1400 bucks and then we went to different

187
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,190
colocation spaces got a first slash

188
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,600
twenty nine from another RSP and then we

189
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,919
bought a server for thirty thousand

190
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,490
euros for see all the big data

191
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,760
management and yes and then we used

192
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,770
outer replies for our abuse emails this

193
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,599
means if somebody feels annoyed by our

194
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,419
scans he sends abuse message and get an

195
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,100
automatic reply which explains what we

196
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,190
are doing why we are doing the research

197
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,290
and how he can and what is the way to

198
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,550
get excluded from our scans by putting

199
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,560
them on our blacklist

200
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,650
the result is that the abuse messages

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,190
messages reduced by approximately 90

202
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,049
percent and that also the IDS message

203
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,169
messages that told us that we are get

204
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,689
blocked and so on also massively reduced

205
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,000
and we are can now do complete with you

206
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,660
complete abuse message messages of our

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,510
own and this shows that using a slash 24

208
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,319
sir like 1000 IP addresses for source

209
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,529
addresses for scan

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,240
works really good so what is the

211
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,250
infrastructure sir first we have a front

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,589
end then you can click okay I want to

213
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,570
scan this IP address space very often

214
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:09,240
just saying zero zero zero slash zero

215
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,769
this means incomplete internet then this

216
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,319
goes to the scan Marsters the scan

217
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,009
master looks what scan algorithm we have

218
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:19,160
choosen then he will take the IP for

219
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:21,690
address base cut it into small pieces

220
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,790
randomize the IP addresses in this into

221
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,500
small pieces and then it sends to the

222
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,170
search node cluster search node cluster

223
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,949
scans internet and sends the data to the

224
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,410
aggregator

225
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:36,209
first of all it is very important that

226
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,339
if the search node fails that the work

227
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,989
package the search node has to work on

228
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,720
to source the number of IP addresses

229
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,730
will get reassigned by a scan master

230
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,680
through another search node this is a

231
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,360
kind of failsafe because very often

232
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,189
maybe people using jet map or a

233
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,220
distributed map scanners they know it

234
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,899
then it's a servant node cut pro and

235
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,550
then you have to do some manual work and

236
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,670
then you have to choose to look or what

237
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,939
was the last IP number where and how was

238
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,560
lost prime number and how to in the end

239
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,180
go on with your own skin and that's very

240
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,979
important if you want to set up a global

241
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,630
scale infrastructure you need a kind of

242
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,250
scan master that is managing the scans

243
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,350
looking that everything is working and

244
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,010
if not then he needs to kind have like a

245
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,600
kind of recovery procedure so the search

246
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,430
node cluster itself consists of

247
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,220
different search nodes into two

248
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,680
differents colocation centers at first

249
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,750
we have person scanner just sending the

250
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,239
masses of sins out on the internet that

251
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,800
self-written ago and for and then we

252
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,540
have an app scanner it's a customized

253
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,430
death-grip version because that group is

254
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,769
very good tool that surprised a lot of

255
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,550
protocols and we added some some frozen

256
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:43,319
protocols and and use this kind of

257
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,870
application scanner and then all the

258
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:48,149
data goes to the aggregator the task of

259
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,000
the aggregator is that if a search not

260
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,509
failed and another search node has has

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,339
has has taken over in the NZ burg then

262
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:59,610
you have maybe multiple results and the

263
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,960
aggregator aggregates all data and

264
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,570
pays attention that you will not have

265
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,950
multiple results in the database then we

266
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,930
have data enrichment that's very

267
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,029
important just scanning the Internet is

268
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,770
not sufficient so maybe you have know

269
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,960
all the ports and then you have the

270
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,819
application data like TLS certificates

271
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,920
information and so on but we have two

272
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,529
enrichment with further data we have

273
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,390
access to G Whois database so the inert

274
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:25,959
objects this means if you're doing who

275
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,580
is 8.8.8.8 as the companies that own see

276
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,589
who is blog and then maybe stand some

277
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,130
information for what is see who is blog

278
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:36,010
used then we have also reverse dns 0ip

279
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,070
let's say where our CIP approximately

280
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,110
located and we using a BGP prefix

281
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,959
information so we're saying ok - which

282
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,209
announced BGP prove prefix dustless IP

283
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,609
belong and also we put the information

284
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,529
together and which autonomous systems

285
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,950
belongs which autonomous system belongs

286
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:56,020
to the IP address asteroid solution we

287
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,550
have choosen elasticsearch because it's

288
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,189
one of the best databases I have ever

289
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,790
seen recently since the new version 7.3

290
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,950
it's very good and here you can see that

291
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,949
as a protocols we are currently support

292
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,050
we are concentrating very very strongly

293
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,209
on industrial protocols but we also

294
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,310
support normal protocol most of the

295
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,869
protocols are from z-trip itself but we

296
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,689
have also some special protocols like

297
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,540
the phoenix protocol and some other so

298
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,110
now thinking about some numbers and

299
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:29,790
settings so if you know you're really

300
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:33,820
not IP addresses we have approximately

301
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,680
4.3 billion IP addresses and very often

302
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,770
people are sending all the IP addresses

303
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,079
out but the problem is that only 2.8

304
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,699
billion of these IP addresses are routed

305
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,950
in the Internet this means you can only

306
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,260
reach at a maximum of 2.8 billion IP

307
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,779
addresses on the internet so if you get

308
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,760
some kind of BGP feed like if you have

309
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:55,600
your own bgp router or have a fee to the

310
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,209
bgp router or use cairo data you can

311
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,770
reduce the number of TCP syn packets by

312
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:06,010
35 percent because when you're only

313
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,410
sends the TCP IP packets in the routed

314
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,450
IP space then you can save a lot of a

315
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,610
lot of TC

316
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,540
soon packets you don't need to scan the

317
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:17,640
private IP addresses and so on right so

318
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:20,099
first thing you have to reconsider set a

319
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,910
TCP syn packet is approximately 30 pi

320
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,980
it's big this means 70 pius x 2.8

321
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,860
billion IP addresses means that you're

322
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,310
just sending data with a single tcp/ip

323
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,870
scan 200 gigabyte of data you will us

324
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,560
send it to the internet but the

325
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:40,470
interesting point is that that you will

326
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,569
at the maximum get only reply from 2% of

327
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,720
all appear packets you will send out

328
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:49,590
it's very easy calculation the most used

329
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,380
protocol on the Internet is HTTP and so

330
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:55,650
you can see that we have 55 56 million

331
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,930
HTTP hosts divided by 2.8 billion routed

332
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,380
IP addresses as 2% this means we have

333
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:03,630
just a hit rate of 2% 98 percent of all

334
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,050
TCP syn packets from the 2.8 billion IP

335
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,540
addresses are overhead in the end so

336
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,400
next question is using one son or two

337
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,640
soon every time it's a discussion we

338
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,130
have tested it sending doubled since

339
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,180
makes no sense because results get not

340
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,550
doubled right you see it's negligible in

341
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,349
my perspective you maybe receive some

342
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,930
better results but we can also see an

343
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,700
ssa ssh you can you are able to receive

344
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,849
worse results at the same time kind and

345
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,730
it's permeating the standard aeration so

346
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,130
and also compared to sensors you can see

347
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,770
that the results our results are really

348
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,650
comparable to chances that this kind of

349
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,980
setup works very interesting census uses

350
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,140
slash 23 we are losing it / 21st which

351
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,360
means we have s twice and source IP

352
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,250
addresses and our results are also some

353
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,050
minor better but you have to keep in

354
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,430
mind census is running much more long as

355
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,990
a service you're getting much more

356
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,739
internet and they have maybe a bigger

357
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,870
black lists so what about skete very

358
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,780
often people say mass gain maximum speed

359
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,060
I can't don't recommend that if you use

360
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,010
the packet they tell data they provide

361
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,979
that you can

362
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,720
look it up then you can see that we have

363
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,330
your scanning with scan speed a la

364
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,870
approximately 70 am but taking six to

365
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,760
seven hours and then you can see that if

366
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,510
your scan from a single source of pee

367
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,030
like everybody can do in a time period

368
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,340
of two hours your data will be decorated

369
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,800
by ten to thirty percent

370
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:40,090
this means you will see in a worst case

371
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,069
only 2/3 of the whole internet so

372
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:47,230
scanning strategies very interesting

373
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:50,520
point you see that the imagine a new

374
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,920
zero day remote explored a Brazil day

375
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,660
arrives on earth right and then you may

376
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,420
be interested to scan the internet very

377
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,390
repeatedly not not like every week but

378
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,400
like every day or every 10 hours or 20

379
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,250
hours whatever then it's a very good

380
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:10,030
idea to scan the complete internet once

381
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:13,480
and then to Riskin only see bgp prefixes

382
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,930
was at least one host in it and this

383
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,450
will save you additional 25 to 50

384
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:23,319
percent of the routed ipv4 address space

385
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:26,340
and scan time and I call those bgp

386
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,780
prefix hitler's ever in a paper out

387
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,890
about it and published on the internet

388
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,260
measurement conference if you're

389
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,980
interested please have a look into very

390
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,390
interesting so next problem was we are

391
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,820
our own ISP

392
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:43,030
and suddenly the police arrived said mmm

393
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,800
you're doing malicious attempts not they

394
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,900
do not ask the sort of doing malicious I

395
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,010
said who is the owner of this IP address

396
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,660
who has used this IP address and then I

397
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,390
because we are our own Internet service

398
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,600
provider and then we receive it and then

399
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,310
we talked with them and said now it's we

400
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,690
are as the owner of the IP address and

401
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,609
we have used that for the Internet's

402
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,620
against and they got some kind of afraid

403
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,240
because normally you are not allowed to

404
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,550
get informed that there are some police

405
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,870
investigations about you but then we

406
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,419
explained that we are a chief security

407
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,189
researcher that we are doing good stuff

408
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,720
that we are providing the information

409
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,850
that we informing people and so on and

410
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,230
then for them at worst okay and we have

411
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,969
never heard about it but in the first

412
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,919
moment I have read susima

413
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:28,890
I got well was really amazing

414
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:31,140
hardware setup very important if you

415
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,880
want to do a lot of internet scans all

416
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,840
of this protocol application data in

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,730
Richmond runs on the size of C protocol

418
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,470
it's quite different and you can see

419
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,750
it's all really big numbers a single

420
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,299
HTTP again is about like seven hundred

421
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,400
gigabyte HTTP we hundred gigabyte and

422
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,820
tell others only like two gigabyte of

423
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,840
data so therefore we have bought a big a

424
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,240
big server consisting of MDF XE seven

425
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,600
five five one so we bought two of these

426
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,600
CPUs we have one terabyte RAM and we use

427
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,010
fifty percent of C of the memory for the

428
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,799
elasticsearch people itself

429
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,649
and they use 50 percent just for caching

430
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,679
then we have 40 terabyte of SSD data

431
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:15,809
because the is the stuff that it cannot

432
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,210
sit in the RAM needs to be stored on the

433
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,399
SSD because we need a lot of high i/o

434
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,529
interaction and then we are running it

435
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:25,199
on a right now for just performance in

436
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,659
treatments and for long term storage and

437
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,520
also copying copying see data from the

438
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:32,390
index that are running on the right now

439
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,529
as a steve we have about seventy two

440
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:40,350
terabyte HDD running in a right v so our

441
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:43,440
first problem was when we have get at

442
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,809
our server we started an h top and we

443
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,450
are not able to see our processes

444
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:52,289
because we got so much cpus and they got

445
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,789
hyper-threaded is like 120 128 is abuse

446
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:58,309
and first we need to investigate how to

447
00:18:53,789 --> 00:19:00,360
configure h top to see our processes

448
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,010
okay next interesting point

449
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,899
elasticsearch also some tweaking points

450
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,090
most people do a really really big

451
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,949
mistake there have may be a lot of

452
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,199
memory and they're doing just only one

453
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,000
elasticsearch node but the problem is if

454
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,210
you have you note has

455
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,230
allocates more than 26 gigabyte of ram

456
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,980
then the approval machine they use

457
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,799
64-bit pointers

458
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,990
instead of special compressed 32-bit

459
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,770
pointers Java does some pointers special

460
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:34,409
magic and the problem is when they use

461
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:37,900
64-bit pointers then each load of a

462
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:40,720
pointer uses as as much as twice

463
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,059
officer of the Benton earth because 2062

464
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,740
bit are much bigger than a 32-bit

465
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:50,590
pointer right so it this gave autism so

466
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,440
we are have divided elasticsearch into

467
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:56,379
different search nodes and each and each

468
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,420
in each node has a maximum of 20 60 or

469
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:02,170
byte per node and this has given us an

470
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,630
in treatment of approximately 30 to 40

471
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,940
percent unbelievable by just splitting

472
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,740
the database into several several

473
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,260
processes in the end if you're

474
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,300
interested how Java is doing memory

475
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,010
management and so on using elasticsearch

476
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:19,210
there's a very good article about it

477
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:23,470
just have a look into it so now let's go

478
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:25,809
into the results so what we see here

479
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,530
it's a key banner it's the front end of

480
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:32,500
this of elasticsearch and here we have

481
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,360
an interactive possibility to get a

482
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,740
rough overview about the autonomous

483
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,050
systems and the structure of the

484
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:43,990
Internet at first you can see so it's

485
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:47,440
the most HTTP HTTP host here hosted by

486
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,880
Amazon and then we have we can go see

487
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,590
what is the next biggest autonomous

488
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,210
system okay we sees a common Akamai's

489
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,459
once the biggest content delivery

490
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,429
networks we have ones on the earth and

491
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,370
then in the second ring we can see the

492
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:03,580
BGP prefixes there can see that amazon

493
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,949
has here 12/12 and announces this area

494
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,580
also no slash 12 there we have slash 13

495
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:12,400
and so on so and next step on the third

496
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,559
ring we can see ok there is Amazon we

497
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,640
can see there is a specific announced

498
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,280
BGP prefix is 3 208 / 12 and we can see

499
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,710
how a service distribution inside of

500
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,660
this prefix and that is the way how how

501
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,970
I understand the internet the internet

502
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,770
is not about nations and countries it's

503
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,260
only about autonomous systems their

504
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,270
prefixes and the internal structure of

505
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,309
the previous which kind of services -

506
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,620
they use and here you can very good see

507
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:42,220
that it uses Apache engines and also

508
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,620
some some other servers and you can see

509
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,440
there's a big difference between Amazon

510
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,080
and Akamai because he on Akamai you can

511
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,789
see every server and the prefix has the

512
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,619
same server banner

513
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,509
every time it's Akamai jiho's you would

514
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:57,100
got any information about which kind of

515
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:59,139
web servers are they using is your own

516
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,029
web server is it Apache or nginx

517
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:03,129
whatever they have just changed the

518
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:05,229
banner and here you can see the

519
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:06,998
difference between two autonomous system

520
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:09,429
echo Mars content delivery provider

521
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,320
Amazon a small kind of a holster right

522
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,629
and that's why they have a much more

523
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,479
hetero green structure what I have not

524
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:18,908
done is we clicked on Amazon and said

525
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:22,479
okay let's look into Amazon how is

526
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:25,210
Amazon structured and Tito and here can

527
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:26,889
see the different prefixes and again the

528
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,080
service distribution you can get a rough

529
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:32,498
overview it's just about it's a top 10

530
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,749
or top 12 prefixes and now we are adding

531
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:37,269
the Whois information and now it's

532
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,609
getting very interesting so we have from

533
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,220
inner circles the autonomous system then

534
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:45,158
we have the prefix now we have the huge

535
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,830
description and see who is prefix and we

536
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,259
can see that Amazon is structuring their

537
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,359
previous there is a network they have a

538
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:55,299
slash 12 and then they have inside a

539
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:57,489
slash 26 standing in his database and we

540
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:00,070
can also see the customer here it's

541
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:03,099
actor in cooperation right and then you

542
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:07,509
can go around and can see about the

543
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:09,879
different Amazon customers and see how

544
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:12,669
Amazon structuring their internet and

545
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:15,309
then you can look okay that's BGP prefix

546
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:18,460
that custom X was it that is prefix who

547
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:22,119
is prefix XY that and then you can look

548
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,789
how is the service distribution inside

549
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,009
officer who is prefix you're occurring

550
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:29,979
the network in more slices and getting a

551
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:32,229
good understanding about the about the

552
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:34,210
structure of the complete autonomous

553
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:36,580
system here we can have found zoom zoom

554
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,739
was a very well known video conference

555
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,070
communication system and here you can

556
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:44,739
see which kind of services they use we

557
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,049
will click on it just say okay I'm

558
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:48,940
interesting how house zooms that is

559
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:50,889
hosted on Amazon how is it structured

560
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,679
they are using a lot of services just

561
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:56,889
called zoom but they also use some 1.13

562
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,509
7 service from M Jakes and also some

563
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:01,689
engines without any kind of version

564
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:03,759
information in the end sir and using

565
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,010
autonomous system information BGP

566
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,040
prefixes

567
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,650
and also Whois information gives you a

568
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,510
very good overview about the structure

569
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,200
of autonomous system and about the

570
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:19,650
internet itself so going next here

571
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,860
another servlets that was bagged up now

572
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:25,260
here a look into OVH over ages one of

573
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,350
the third or one of the biggest european

574
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,920
hoster we have and here can also see the

575
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:34,439
BGP prefix oh and let me go to the

576
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,380
presentation mode better so here we can

577
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,810
see they use this slash 16 who has said

578
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,760
it's for dedicated servers and then you

579
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,100
can see they use the slash 18 from the

580
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,370
slash 16 for dedicated service somewhere

581
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:50,909
else we can see they use the slash 24

582
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,879
from this another slash 16 for fail over

583
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:56,460
IPS this means we get infrastructure

584
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,620
information how are organizing themself

585
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,500
that may be interesting for an aunt a

586
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,419
carer or for somebody else right so and

587
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,640
then we can also see which kind of

588
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:09,840
services do they use and we can see that

589
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,960
all fail over IPS have the same web

590
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,449
server in the end and what we can also

591
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,390
do is which kind of web services does

592
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:22,050
OVH at all use and you can see mostly

593
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,630
they use Apache or nginx Apache and so

594
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,930
on so we can see here is a separate list

595
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:30,930
sorted from top down by their major

596
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,130
numbers very interesting but then we

597
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,950
have to complete another all-tournament

598
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,710
system here we have SSH a complete

599
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,310
another protocol and and we can seize it

600
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,960
GoDaddy does not reveal any kind of

601
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,929
information about the internal structure

602
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,120
all who is blocks are the same and and

603
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,280
they also have the same name like the

604
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,129
autonomic system itself and very

605
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,889
interesting they are using everywhere

606
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:59,970
like on 90% of all the servers yeah

607
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:03,000
using the same open SSH version so you

608
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:05,760
can see that GoDaddy is a holster right

609
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,890
so there's as there's a web holster so

610
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,770
they are completely matching different

611
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:15,990
on a different way than OVH or Amazon is

612
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:18,060
doing or Akamai so using this we have

613
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,809
looked for different customers and if

614
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,820
you look and we

615
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,259
description here you can see you can

616
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,999
enumerate a lot of customers from

617
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,100
Amazon's very interesting you can see we

618
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,919
have Cisco you have Samsung we have zoom

619
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,379
and so on

620
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,659
next we can all look how is Amazon

621
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:36,029
structuring the ec2 infrastructure

622
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:38,429
there's all the cloud stuff and so on we

623
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,139
can see we have a lot of house in AVH

624
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:43,409
asia-pacific because they have a very

625
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:45,959
big slash 16 there and we can see says

626
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:48,330
they use airport abbreviations for the

627
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,240
locations of the ec2 clusters you can

628
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:54,509
see it's Dublin then we can see they

629
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,590
using CD which CD G which stands for

630
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:59,009
child to go

631
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:01,499
it's France then we CFRA it's Frankfurt

632
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:03,179
is the Germany and so on and that's very

633
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:04,529
interesting use these also use

634
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,090
information you're getting a lot of

635
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:08,190
infrastructure information about the

636
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,199
autonomous systems and of companies how

637
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,990
are the instructions the network and for

638
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,909
what parts and you know what they what

639
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:18,749
they are doing with their reserved

640
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:21,179
subnets then you can also do some other

641
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:23,369
first further interesting analyzation x'

642
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:27,389
i have said please provide me all

643
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:30,529
microsoft i as 5.0 servers who knows

644
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:35,490
what is the operating system of of it

645
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:37,200
it's Windows 2000 and then I tell then I

646
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,019
tell my database please provide me all

647
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,029
these subject common names so we have a

648
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:44,700
list of the sexual content and we have

649
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:46,649
now a lot of domains that are that are

650
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,440
running on a Microsoft I as a Windows

651
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:53,008
2000 server a very very also selects 20

652
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,779
years old and then we have cannot mostly

653
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:56,429
people say alkanes maybe some old

654
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,740
service they have forgotten to shut it

655
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:01,649
down whatever but then we can see here

656
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,629
on the right side it's the start date to

657
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:05,489
start validity date of the certificate

658
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:07,350
in there you can see there are servers

659
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,529
they are running for some stuff because

660
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:14,820
old all dated forgotten servers get not

661
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:17,730
new as a SSL Certificates right people

662
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,549
are running Windows 2000 server 2000

663
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,980
fears not supported since 15 or 10 years

664
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,110
whatever and providing them as new

665
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,580
certificates and that is unbelievable

666
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,350
for me to see that people are doing an

667
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,530
ant it's also awesome that these Windows

668
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:34,340
systems are still running right it's

669
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:37,350
okay now having looked at the dark side

670
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,330
what we also can do is that we can we

671
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:44,129
also doing some happily analyzes and as

672
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:47,250
taught my database please provide me an

673
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:50,070
an overview about all governance

674
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,770
agencies whatever in Austria and the

675
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:55,290
Whois database and that contains a TLS

676
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:58,350
certificate from forty net in the end so

677
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,790
we are looking for forty net 49

678
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,699
firewalls that are hard bit vulnerable

679
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:05,550
in Austria on governance agencies in the

680
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,970
end and we can see here that we have

681
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:12,570
find a lot of certs German and inst and

682
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,610
some like a bureau of district 1

683
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,800
district 2 and whatever and then we can

684
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,870
see that the issuer organization keyword

685
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,669
is 40 nets or the issue of the

686
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,979
certificate is 40 net and on the right

687
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,830
side you can see very good the different

688
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,310
versions of see firewalls that was can

689
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:31,560
date from 2017 then ask and again at the

690
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,720
Internet in one real later and now you

691
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,550
can see they have replaced the 14th

692
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,160
firewalls were so force appliance right

693
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:41,850
very interesting what you can see using

694
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,710
time differential analysis in the end so

695
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,300
then if you're scanning for industrial

696
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,730
control systems you can also see that

697
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,040
it's scan for a self a common Modbus you

698
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,200
can see a very big distribution and you

699
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,379
can see there's a hard collation for the

700
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,660
economic point so if you look to former

701
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,430
GDR region here you have not that much

702
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,710
industrial control systems we have more

703
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,630
in south and the West you have an North

704
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,640
Italy a lot of industrial control system

705
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,770
Hart big economic area in Italy and

706
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,480
thous Adelie you have not that much

707
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,970
industrial control system seems to

708
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,730
Scotland compared to England it's very

709
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:17,250
interesting that you can can can derive

710
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,620
the economic power from the internet

711
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,420
against very interesting when we can see

712
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,189
it's a very big problem that always

713
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,650
evolve people putting industrial control

714
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,620
systems on the Internet here are some

715
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,180
numbers so makes sense as sevakram

716
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,949
stands for Siemens and we can see

717
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,440
Germany has the most number of Siemens

718
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:39,090
industrial control systems also fully

719
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,100
reasonable so now next analysis here we

720
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,850
can see I said I want to see for

721
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,389
heartbeat vulnerable servers in April

722
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,320
2000

723
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:51,748
17 in Afghanistan and here we can see on

724
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,428
the autonomous system the autonomous

725
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,559
system is the Afghan telecom government

726
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:57,809
communication network and see who is

727
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,479
description is in debt I have never seen

728
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:01,829
an so detailed whose information it's a

729
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:03,899
government communication network

730
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:08,639
district communication whatever for the

731
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:11,639
communication of 34 provinces into 357

732
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:13,738
districts in Kabul Afghanistan and now

733
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:15,899
you're looking who is the issue of the

734
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:19,499
certificate you can see it's a pfSense

735
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:21,449
firewall so you can if doing these kind

736
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:23,159
of analyzers and putting data together

737
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,559
with other data you are very first

738
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,979
finding very interesting results and I'm

739
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,709
sure that the CIA is going on the since

740
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:34,320
in some years right okay now we are

741
00:31:31,709 --> 00:31:36,450
getting to the real bad point people are

742
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,849
putting in the Whois information a lot

743
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:41,700
of stuffs you also to say this is power

744
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:44,609
plant XYZ I can't believe it people are

745
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,070
doing that and here we can see it it's a

746
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:49,309
bigger power bigger power plant is a

747
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:53,458
coal-fired power plant and here we have

748
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:54,989
VPN endpoint by our HTTP and since power

749
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:58,799
plant has a capacity of approximately

750
00:31:54,989 --> 00:32:00,389
500 megawatts supplying like 1.5 million

751
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,779
people it's not a small power plant

752
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:08,549
right so and now we are looking the scan

753
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:11,489
date is from 2018 right so in August

754
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:14,549
2000 18 and we can see the certificate

755
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:16,589
got eight invalid on July ok it's one

756
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:18,440
month it's ok but in the end it's a

757
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:21,958
critical infrastructure with an invalid

758
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,119
VPN endpoint certificate then I did the

759
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:25,950
risk in and inform Tinelli mode them I

760
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:30,299
contacted them I got never a reply and

761
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:33,179
then I risk and November and still again

762
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:35,369
sees certificate as out of dead and now

763
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,369
I did some neural scans and I found that

764
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,859
they have updated certificate in April

765
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:42,238
2000 19 and it's a critical

766
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,109
infrastructure people should not care

767
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,909
about it in the end

768
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:50,399
so for me I'm living in Germany I'm not

769
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:52,259
funny but that so now I will provide you

770
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,949
another further very interesting

771
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:54,950
analysis

772
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:06,419
another power plant where is it

773
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:08,610
perfectly so what we have here in the

774
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,530
first as we are looking for craft work

775
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:13,679
that stands for power plant in German

776
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,570
and we can see we have only here south

777
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,890
on am assistant names the BGP prefix

778
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,600
name and the server banners that is

779
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,160
information you can see on senses or

780
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,699
showdown because they do not use Whois

781
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:27,510
information now we are say please enable

782
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:30,090
Whois information and then we can see

783
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,390
some very more interesting result in the

784
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,699
end

785
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:36,210
so let's enable the Whois information

786
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,130
and then we can see we have our ve it's

787
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,500
a very big German energy company and

788
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,600
 the power plant called neither

789
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,670
awesome-looking on Wikipedia what is

790
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,760
neither awesome oh it's just a second

791
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:50,940
largest coal power plant in Germany this

792
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,360
time we have about like 4 mega watt of

793
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,340
energy of energy capacity in the end so

794
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,709
now that's very interesting but what is

795
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,050
for service oh very interesting

796
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,840
it's a Lancome seven one one one VPN

797
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:07,500
gateway Lancome for a critical

798
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,370
infrastructure ok let's look ah there is

799
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,860
a list of ant

800
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,779
oil and of the services devices right

801
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,160
maybe is it the end of service device

802
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,919
maybe it's like one of your old I don't

803
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,500
know let's have a look how old is this

804
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,179
unsupported system or since when is it

805
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,070
not unsupported and here you can see

806
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,910
it's Lancome seven one one device is

807
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:30,179
unsupported since May 2010 it's a nine

808
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:32,250
year old unsupported VPN a gateway and

809
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,380
that is the scan from the mid of August

810
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,090
it's like one week old right so it's

811
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:42,679
recent we can see it on the internet

812
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:42,679
life so very interesting thanks

813
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,010
so now it's getting better right

814
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,470
let's look which kind of cipher suite is

815
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,540
it supporting so now let's go back again

816
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,428
to the lancome device and we can see how

817
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,340
it's a secure cipher we have on the

818
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:00,680
world is the T errors errors our C for

819
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,450
cipher right Oh unbelievable because

820
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,230
it's so old system it's not surprising

821
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:08,569
but in the end hell we have a Curtis law

822
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,369
here in Germany energy company is

823
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,200
spending a lot of money how could it

824
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,540
possible there is a very very 10 year

825
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,460
old VPN gateway with the rc4 site on a

826
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,250
critical infrastructure I cannot get it

827
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:22,160
right so I have a lot of data I could

828
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:25,760
talk like 2030 you further minutes

829
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,618
whatever but it's my wife sense I have

830
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,010
to stop spending so much time time as

831
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:34,609
this dater yeah so now we are going to

832
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:42,430
the summary and then I'm very I want to

833
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:47,180
discuss with you about the results ok so

834
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:49,040
summing it up using raw data or internet

835
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,500
scans is very important and you have to

836
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,080
enrich with this bgp who is in protocol

837
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,960
for specific information this only gives

838
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,230
you the power for complete

839
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:04,490
infrastructure analyzers of the internet

840
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:06,320
there are a lot of sir it's very

841
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,020
important for you to understand the

842
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,330
topology the structure the structure

843
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,040
itself and you can you know very easy

844
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,779
for you then in the end if you do your

845
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,119
own scans in the data enrichment to

846
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,130
identify all websites or vulnerabilities

847
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,020
that may be belong to a company to a

848
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,380
critical infrastructure of maybe to

849
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,869
government agencies in the end

850
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:30,650
furthermore how to do this here is my

851
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:33,770
small cheat sheet get here ona s vs / 22

852
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:37,070
this means like 1024 IP addresses

853
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:40,460
skin.not forrester than 70 m bit use

854
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:42,500
ones and twos and makes most makes no

855
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,820
sense because you take like twice for

856
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,280
your skin and you will send too much

857
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:50,060
data and you will get more engaged with

858
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,849
industrial with IDs systems

859
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,790
scanning the internet in two hours from

860
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:59,570
a single source RP you will only see 10

861
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,080
you will only see like 70 to 90% of the

862
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,359
Internet

863
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,160
sir it's not a good idea or you need you

864
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,609
can do it but then you know that it idea

865
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,720
is not very reliable you can use only

866
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:13,940
your should only scan bgp prefixes that

867
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,029
are rooted and that way you will save

868
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,720
about 35 office efficient traffic and

869
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,940
time and if you want to do very fast

870
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,919
repeatedly scans in a case of a short

871
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,590
remote executable were a bit ideas may

872
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,780
be released you should beat use BGP

873
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,850
prefix Hitler's meaning scanning the

874
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,310
internet once and then only scanning the

875
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:38,420
BGP prefixes and this will save you

876
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:41,180
further 25 to 50 percent of C routed

877
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:44,600
ipv4 address space thank you very much

878
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,960
if you want to email me or whatever just

879
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,970
email me and I'm living here on the camp

880
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,859
it's a Garofalo and a big green tent and

881
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,779
if you're interested in scanning please

882
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:55,520
contact me because a lot of people i

883
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,170
know what scanning on ourselves and

884
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,810
you're not talking to each other and

885
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,880
that why I'm sitting here I want to

886
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,740
explain you how to scan and I really

887
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,660
would like to set up a kind of scan

888
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,970
community in the USA 1/2 a scanning

889
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,368
community and here in Germany rebound so

890
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,618
please help me come around with a beer

891
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:14,780
and then we can talk about how to scan

892
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:18,970
and I have also some further interesting

893
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,970
informations yeah thank you very much

894
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,330
so thank you Johannes for a super

895
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,149
interesting talk we have some time for

896
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:36,509
questions so if you have any questions

897
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,560
please we will have a microphone shortly

898
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,250
but in the meantime we'll take a

899
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,250
question from the internet

900
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:47,690
yes the that wants to know whether it's

901
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:50,340
possible to access the scan data or you

902
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,740
publish your scan result or your

903
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,540
research resides yeah sir in the end I'm

904
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,620
not publishing the results results

905
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,300
because and this talk was aimed to

906
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:02,400
explain you how you can set up your own

907
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,230
infrastructure sir you don't need that

908
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,150
much money like 30000 euros for the

909
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,250
service you can I just need it because I

910
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:11,700
want to scan a load a huge load of

911
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:14,310
different protocols and so let's talk

912
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,560
the aim was to show you how to do it on

913
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,660
your own but I want to share the

914
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,950
information with penetration testers

915
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,649
because they need this kind of

916
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,540
information to detect complete attack

917
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:28,020
surfaces or companies they are dealing

918
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,970
with in the end and it's for me to to in

919
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,220
the end I do not know what people would

920
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,660
do with all these data and I don't want

921
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,100
to be the people as the guy who was

922
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,140
publishing it to maybe to the bad guys

923
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,980
and that that's why I only want to

924
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,970
provide it to some penetration testers

925
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:49,200
ok question from the audience

926
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:52,490
hello I even from Italy so I'm doing a

927
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,799
project focused on Italy in doing

928
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,720
massive scanning and I come up with an

929
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,870
interesting problem that you may already

930
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,990
figured out basically those kind of scan

931
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:06,960
are not aggressive vulnerability

932
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,899
analysis are basically creating a

933
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,710
software inventory from the service you

934
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:16,380
can connect to a speak to I came up to

935
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,650
the problem of out of a scan I would

936
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,200
like to detect the surface of

937
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,300
vulnerabilities so get out some kind of

938
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,240
indicators that this service is

939
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,060
vulnerable or not and the very simplest

940
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,430
easiest approach is to make a matching

941
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,560
with the CVE database or

942
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,930
conversion fingerprinting but I've been

943
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,779
told by multiple person that the amount

944
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,370
of a false positive is pretty high

945
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,740
yeah do you have any insight on that

946
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,779
yeah so you just need to look on

947
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,569
especially Debian dip and distribution

948
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,370
is it very doing very often if there is

949
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,800
some kind for a vulnerability version 1

950
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,330
1 1 of a certain web server they will

951
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,310
provide a patch but they will not

952
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,130
increase the minor number of the service

953
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:01,049
so it's only a potential vulnerability

954
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,330
right in the end that's that's a big

955
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,520
problem and how to just the only way

956
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,620
would be try to exploit it but you

957
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,380
cannot do it as a researcher and there's

958
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,480
bad guys are more in a better position

959
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,270
and so we can only say what is the

960
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,340
potential what are the potential

961
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,259
vulnerability or capacity and the end

962
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,810
yeah I'm totally agree with you that's a

963
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,170
big problem and for this I have no

964
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:28,890
solution in the end right now next

965
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:32,250
question thanks for the talk and have

966
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:35,310
you thought about scanning ipv6 prefixes

967
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:39,440
yeah we have we have some currently also

968
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:43,110
a research project not maybe next year

969
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:47,070
thank you any more questions from the

970
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,360
audience or from the internet ok looks

971
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,260
like we're done so again a big round of

972
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:59,390
applause to Jonas

973
00:41:49,260 --> 00:42:02,480
