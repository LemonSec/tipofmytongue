2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:18,500
put your money where your mouth is

3
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:22,130
Tobias is gonna tell us what happened

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:31,520
when he did just that let's welcome him

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:33,920
with a heartfelt round of applause thank

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,910
you very much for the kind introduction

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,470
so today or tonight I want to tell you a

8
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:46,449
little story I was part of a project in

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:49,190
2016 and today I want to show you some

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:53,360
takes on vulnerability disclosure and

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:57,410
also how to do security research for

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,750
medical device products um some of you

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:06,439
might have seen this kind of news

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:08,030
articles they were out in 2017 you might

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,320
be thinking why is this guy talking

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,880
about stuff happened in 2017 there are

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,329
such things called

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,030
in das and mine was for three years so

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:24,068
it started to 16 now we've 219 that's

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:28,009
why I'm talking today about this stuff

21
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:30,139
stories there were some pacemakers out

22
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,950
there with a lot of vulnerabilities and

23
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:37,339
it led to a recall of more than half a

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,349
million pacemakers and also a new way

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,979
for vulnerability disclosure was taken

26
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:46,639
so why do I tell you about the stuff so

27
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:48,590
let me first introduce me briefly to you

28
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:52,158
my name is Tobias

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,549
I work as security researcher and mainly

30
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,419
I do

31
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,939
IOT embedded systems security and one of

32
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:02,270
my main area of interest is reversing

33
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:05,270
wireless communication and back in 215 I

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,969
did a talk at blackhat focusing on 6b

35
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,220
security and some guy from some guys

36
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:12,739
from a company called medic where they

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,170
were watching this talk and said ok hmm

38
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,870
we also have a interesting project

39
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,880
concerning reverse engineering reverse

40
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,190
engineering wireless communication maybe

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,940
hire this guy

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,070
so this company was called mezack yeah

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,880
they are interested in medical device

44
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,920
security and they had a project with the

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,680
goal to find zero day vulnerabilities in

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,959
pacemaker communication and they

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,750
assessed for vendors and I was part of

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,480
the team doing reverse engineering for

49
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,230
the same truth

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,030
project so quick introduction yeah how

51
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,700
does the ecosystem of modern pacemakers

52
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,180
look like so you have a pacemaker that's

53
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,450
implanted now medical term is implanted

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,660
cardiac device and ICD that's connected

55
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,060
to either a program that's usually at

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,570
the hospital or at the doctor so you can

57
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:11,080
do calibrations reading the health data

58
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,950
out of the system and send it back to

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,020
the cloud

60
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,420
the Merlin net in this case because

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,880
there is always a cloud also in medical

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:25,660
nowadays they also have a home monitor

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,940
that's used for I think some comfort for

64
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,310
the customers because usually they had

65
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,430
to go to the doctor's office regularly

66
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,140
to just to have the stuff inspected if

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,709
it works what a rate of what are the

68
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,230
data and just to have it double-checked

69
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,600
but a better doctor nowadays the stuff

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,970
is collected automatically using

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,920
wireless communication so you just have

72
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,560
it in your home usually in the bedroom

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,200
and as soon as you're within the range

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,530
of the system your data is collected and

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,820
sent back to the cloud that's kind of a

76
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,160
predictive maintaining and maintenance

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:08,470
for for humans and it's quite a big step

78
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:11,590
for patients but it's also a first

79
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,600
attack vector because in the past this

80
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,209
was done by a new field communication so

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,829
you had to be really really close by to

82
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,300
get a connection to the pacemaker but

83
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:24,669
they switched it up it's now a different

84
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,240
frequency band it's called the mix band

85
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,880
for medical devices it's 401 to 406

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
megahertz and we chose this is a first

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,750
attack vector and said okay would be

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,040
cool

89
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:42,270
to shock a pacemaker using wireless so

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:46,060
that's easy nowadays because hardware

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,590
made a huge progress the last years

92
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,180
yesterday there was a very interesting

93
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,419
talk about the limitations of

94
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,210
software-defined radio yeah I can highly

95
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,990
recommend to watch this talk because a

96
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:02,080
lot of this stuff I have experienced by

97
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,500
myself especially the limitation side so

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,380
have a look at it ok so we used

99
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,530
software-defined radio to inspect the

100
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,930
mix band to find first attack vector so

101
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,030
how do you do this because you don't

102
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,800
have any information where to start so

103
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,619
first we do wireless reverse engineering

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,320
and I all wanted just to give you a

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,650
short introduction what we are my best

106
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,630
practice for doing this not for the

107
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,450
pacemaker but in general I would

108
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,820
strongly recommend to check something

109
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,990
called the FCC Eddy every product sold

110
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:40,450
in the US has to be checked by the FCC

111
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,710
and you get a label with a number and

112
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:47,050
you can connect this number to wrong

113
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,020
direction to some information because

114
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,930
there is online a database where you

115
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,750
find some stuff from the testing

116
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,120
procedure and if you're lucky sometimes

117
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,160
you just have one device and you don't

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,990
want to open it because you maybe you

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,420
damage it but you want to get to know of

120
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,660
the internals and if you're lucky you

121
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,750
will find on this website also stuff

122
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,870
like internal what moment internal

123
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:18,640
photos oh the block diagram user manual

124
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:22,480
so that's a very good first start to

125
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,659
investigate a wireless device also I can

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,810
recommend check patents google has a

127
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,510
patent search online you won't find the

128
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,650
most detailed information but sometimes

129
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:37,330
you find specific URLs of protocols so

130
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,690
how does this communication work in

131
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,810
general also a nice point to check and

132
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,260
of course product documentation our F

133
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,360
chip

134
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:50,030
specs firmware software whatever you get

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,319
look at it take this information it will

136
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,888
speed up your process of reverse

137
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,500
engineering drastically if everything

138
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,389
doesn't work fall back - busy signal

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,310
inspection yeah but it's a very hard

140
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,280
task and you have to be kind of

141
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:08,379
experienced to do it and I would not

142
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,590
recommend to start with this with this

143
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,150
okay

144
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:17,179
also frequency bands for leaky issues

145
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,419
radio spectrum is very wide so where to

146
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,310
start from medical devices obviously

147
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,289
have a start at the mix band because

148
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,860
it's just reserved for this as a start

149
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:31,188
and what we also this did was interviews

150
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,560
interviews is always good ask people

151
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:35,810
they have experience with this tooling

152
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,629
what are the problems sometimes they

153
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,300
can't tell you how it works but they

154
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:43,939
have experience in troubleshooting maybe

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,759
to say okay if we have a lot of Wi-Fi

156
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,889
networks for example our stuff didn't

157
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,169
work so you can think maybe there is a

158
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:54,889
problem with some interference from

159
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:58,159
Wi-Fi and it doesn't work we also used

160
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,690
an additional service the company bought

161
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,800
the service that hooks you up with

162
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:06,110
former employees of companies so we got

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,289
access to former developers the work

164
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,409
there we talked with them facing the

165
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,550
problems are on a security perspective

166
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:17,089
where to start

167
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,400
sometimes they gave us good hints where

168
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:23,210
do you have a look at but I will touch

169
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,400
it later on ok

170
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,520
could be patent as a toll that's an

171
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,169
example from SiC P but you see there is

172
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,370
a description how the basic networking

173
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:37,130
works also RF chip documentation

174
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,429
what would I check by the way that's not

175
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,860
the transceiver chip from the pacemaker

176
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,930
but that's a good example for example

177
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,529
it's listed what kind of my relations

178
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:53,290
are supported and what frequency ranges

179
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,290
are supported and also what data rates

180
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,939
leave you issues so the the radio

181
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,050
spectrum is highly regulated if you have

182
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,330
a look for something the

183
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,569
this thing is not at the eyes and bands

184
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:12,149
have a look here maybe it has also

185
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:13,589
dedicated some some dedicated space we

186
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,050
did the stuff get at some information

187
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,420
did some basic testing we started with a

188
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,399
simple replay attack so we just record a

189
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,790
communication and played it back to the

190
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,740
a CD and what happened was we nearly

191
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:30,870
instantly found first vulnerabilities

192
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,910
what kind of warn abilities first we

193
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,870
call it crash attack it was no attack

194
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,660
they just crashed

195
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:40,769
if you replayed a communication for some

196
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,380
time the Pacemakers they just crashed

197
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,820
and they did they didn't recover so

198
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,750
where you were not able to use them

199
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,019
again

200
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,910
there was no failsafe no no safety no

201
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,250
security mode they were just broken yeah

202
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,240
so we brick devices just by simple

203
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,940
replaying stuff it was at now is still

204
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,760
my most the major concern I have because

205
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,610
that's no real yeah advanced the tech

206
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,950
it's just this might happen by by by

207
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:13,589
accident and we also found a way to

208
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,930
deplete the energy very very fast that's

209
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:21,600
a problem because you have limited

210
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:24,750
energy so you can't reload the battery

211
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,089
so if your battery's out you need to

212
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:33,360
have a surgery and you have it replaced

213
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:36,990
so this means also very very bad we

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,640
released some videos or we the company

215
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,250
called Matic released videos online

216
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,860
about this they are still on there I put

217
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,550
some the references on there if you want

218
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,260
to see it the proofs how this works

219
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,199
funny side story there is one comment on

220
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,230
there because the videos are not there

221
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:58,109
have a very great production quality and

222
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:02,750
I like the comment and I think it's kind

223
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:05,790
of funny and yeah so replay attacks

224
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:09,089
first and I warn abilities identified

225
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,240
but then we did talk a little bit deeper

226
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:14,889
and did some real reverse engineering so

227
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,259
we get our hands on the basic PEC

228
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,910
structure we found out okay where does

229
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,730
it start where's the synchronization

230
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,589
which CSE they're using what will it do

231
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,970
for error correction but we still

232
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:31,119
struggled with the data blocks yeah

233
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:33,009
in RF there are a lot of ways to cover

234
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:36,220
up your stuff where you can do data

235
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:40,679
whitening you can do encryption it was

236
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:43,809
not possible for us to find it easily so

237
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,639
we kind of got stuck because reverse

238
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,299
engineering is often a very

239
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,850
time-consuming task and since they had

240
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:55,029
nearly every only external researchers

241
00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:00,429
it's also very expensive task if you buy

242
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:03,129
like 10 guys looking at pacemakers we

243
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:07,059
are not the cheapest I think it costs

244
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:09,549
you a lot of money and also even if it's

245
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,399
weak crypto cryptography you won't be

246
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:14,919
able to break it with your eyes just

247
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,529
looking at it won't solve the problem so

248
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:21,699
we had a decision decision to make get

249
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:25,049
somebody who is good at crypto analysis

250
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:30,399
or look at a different attack vector we

251
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:34,929
got got for the second because there is

252
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:39,639
a lot of other things to attack there is

253
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:43,059
also a complex IOT ecosystem and you

254
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:46,029
don't need to attack the hardest target

255
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:48,699
because every one is speaking the same

256
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,679
protocol this means we switch the up and

257
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:56,109
said ok the pacemaker and the wireless

258
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:58,899
communication directly might yeah be too

259
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,639
hard for us to break it in time let's

260
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,949
have a look at the home monitor why a

261
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,889
home monitor because it also

262
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:08,349
communicates wirelessly with the

263
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:11,109
pacemaker and it's a very cheap device

264
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,660
so you can just buy it on eBay for

265
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:16,509
eighteen dollars you can get it at home

266
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:21,309
I brought one today with me just to show

267
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:23,589
you how good that they are made and we

268
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:25,360
said okay maybe there is some stuff on

269
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,600
there that helps us understand the

270
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:33,670
protocol so we took it apart

271
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,620
and check what our f chips are or in

272
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,529
there how they're working and this took

273
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,759
us yeah a little further than further

274
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:46,930
down the road but a big big breakthrough

275
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,040
was we found some debug ports they are

276
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,359
not protected

277
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,089
so it's UART just hook up and you're

278
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,459
connected to the system and the

279
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:00,430
bootloader is not very good protected

280
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:06,099
yeah you see maybe on the screenshot if

281
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:07,989
you are capable of some basic stuff it's

282
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,259
easy to get root access there and let me

283
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,639
show you yeah

284
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:17,290
pray to the demo gods that everything

285
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,630
works so I hooked up a buzz pirate

286
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,279
that's connected to my system and it's

287
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,949
also connected to the pacemaker monitor

288
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,350
I have you see now I'm stuck at the

289
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:29,319
login so there was the traditional boot

290
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:36,639
sequence what I now do is I just press

291
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:38,939
the reset button let me and you see some

292
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,220
stuff is happening happening and I just

293
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:45,430
need to press one button to escape to

294
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:51,819
the bootloader during the screen you

295
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:55,630
just see it's blob is used and yeah we

296
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:59,229
just have to wait for the reboot I press

297
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,000
the button so now we jump directly into

298
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,189
the bootloader

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,209
and you will see there is written out to

300
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:10,170
put in progress press any key to stop so

301
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:14,170
that's easy help

302
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:17,050
what should we do just type in help you

303
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:20,920
see what commands you have there is one

304
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:23,500
called boot boot is very promising boot

305
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,329
Linux in RAM with optional kernel

306
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,670
options yeah sounds promising

307
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:31,660
because maybe our goal is to directly

308
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:35,769
put into the into the shell but how how

309
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,899
to do it is just type in status you see

310
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,970
your kernel command-line arguments there

311
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:46,580
you just copied them

312
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:54,600
let me honest that's very hard task boot

313
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:59,670
just insert it again and add just one

314
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:03,210
additional argument and now we should

315
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,150
put up directly into the yeah we don't

316
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,100
have a login prompt anymore so we have

317
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,680
root access now in the system and there

318
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,930
is some interesting information also

319
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:19,469
there typing is always the hardest part

320
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,319
for example you see a non host where is

321
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,030
it communicating to you you see the

322
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,430
addresses from the Merlin net from the

323
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,650
cloud listed there what else do you need

324
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,870
in a cloud you need a password how to

325
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:37,050
log in

326
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:41,540
let me check and there is for example

327
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:46,280
one exam if the P password listed here

328
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,630
and it's not a very good one I think

329
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,089
there is some room for improvement and

330
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,270
this password is the same for every

331
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,910
monitor just some examples you you find

332
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,949
very easily so that's not very

333
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,140
sophisticated hacking but it did the job

334
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:05,130
so we were able to extract some

335
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,510
components from the fembra and go

336
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,180
further down the road of reverse

337
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:12,390
engineering the protocol and what else

338
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,480
do we now have we also have now control

339
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:18,120
of a system the rest the proper RF chip

340
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,810
for communicating directly with the

341
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,540
pacemaker

342
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,879
so the problem also mentioned yesterday

343
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:28,909
is when you do software fine radio you

344
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:32,160
have some timing constraints because the

345
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,660
there is some net like in every protocol

346
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,200
you have some time slots you need to

347
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,330
reply in a specific time and when you do

348
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,030
this with a software fine radio you have

349
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,220
them attached by USB USB has a very high

350
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,700
latency so sometimes you're just too

351
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:52,380
slow to answer them in the right time to

352
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,910
get accepted by the receiver so we just

353
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,240
then switch to

354
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,860
at the Merlion at home as a tech device

355
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,600
okay what else do a tech ya programmer

356
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,110
we also bought this you can buy it on

357
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,360
eBay we bought one recently from a

358
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,469
German secondhand medical device

359
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,770
reseller for 160 euros with valid

360
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,700
medical data still on there so I think

361
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,400
the whole industry need to step up their

362
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,310
game when it comes to privacy and

363
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,880
cybersecurity just as an example so if

364
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:32,669
you tear down this system there's a

365
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,100
removable hard drive no encryption yeah

366
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,710
like Austin Powers says they'd like to

367
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,740
live dangerously yeah one of my favorite

368
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,930
movie quotes so this was our final piece

369
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,380
in the puzzle why because they were Java

370
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:49,110
files so you just decompile them have a

371
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,750
look and there is the the whole protocol

372
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:55,040
was just written there for us just to

373
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,900
implement and not only the protocol also

374
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,149
some codes they're using for kind of a

375
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:05,700
vector access to circumvent encryption

376
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:08,490
that's not only to blame them because

377
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,460
for pacemakers you have also like other

378
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,550
requirements if you go to Australia and

379
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,530
have an have a heart attack you I think

380
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,260
you want the doctors in Australia are

381
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,480
also able to connect to your pacemaker

382
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,970
and read some data so they have kind of

383
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:30,090
a vector Universal key for making this

384
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:31,830
possible okay so we use now the

385
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,550
Millennium as an attack device so we

386
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:37,379
were able to deliver emergency sharks

387
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:41,010
reconfigured as the device make it

388
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,950
vibrate test shocks the demo videos are

389
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,140
still on there on Vimeo

390
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,400
yeah the link is in there I have a look

391
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:54,210
I think they are better than the ones

392
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,390
before so they had a proper speaker I

393
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:01,260
think they're really good to just get

394
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:05,400
what we are doing there okay let's play

395
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,059
a simple game blaming the vendor which

396
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,779
method match

397
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:22,408
such authentication code is used a b c d

398
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:29,649
or e so who is for a a b c close race d

399
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:32,440
no T no e e no trust in the vendor it's

400
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:36,158
actually C so they're doing a little bit

401
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,379
of authentication but 24 bit RSA what

402
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,470
else did they do did to do the

403
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:43,480
home-brewed crypto you know I told you

404
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,840
about the universal key

405
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:51,429
you served up with RSA public keys or

406
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:57,820
truncate keys because memory see ya

407
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:59,289
they did all of this and because you

408
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,649
would be able to guess because when they

409
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:05,499
use 24 bit encryption and then they have

410
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:08,820
32 bit keys so it just the truncated

411
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:12,730
because they didn't have the memory I

412
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,980
it's like a first project to do in at

413
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,369
university or at school how to do

414
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,730
cryptography and do it the bad way and

415
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:24,189
that's a sad part in it because we have

416
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,059
some IP camps some Chinese IP camps in

417
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,639
our office just to get to get to get

418
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:34,928
trained in the stuff they have the same

419
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:37,869
security level as medical devices so I

420
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:40,960
think that's kind of a sad part so let's

421
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:43,658
give you a short technical summary so we

422
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,580
were able to find in two months a lot of

423
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:46,450
critical vulnerabilities with potential

424
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,869
lethal impact

425
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,210
so everybody analyst authorized users

426
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:55,059
could remotely just disabled your

427
00:21:52,210 --> 00:22:00,330
pacemaker make them vibrate deliver you

428
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:01,450
a shock we found a lot of security mmm

429
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,149
nightmares

430
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:08,320
in there ya know best practice was

431
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:11,590
followed and no I think that's very bad

432
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,230
but one might think what about security

433
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,289
certifications because medical is for

434
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,970
certain highly regulated area and you

435
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:24,660
see there is a logo

436
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:26,760
it's ISO 27001 certified and they're

437
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:30,210
very proud of it because they're the the

438
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,650
first medical network that is properly

439
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,049
certified for information systems

440
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:39,870
management system formation security

441
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:42,799
management systems and they express it

442
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,389
openly they're very good at it and

443
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,809
that's a very stringent worldwide

444
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,350
information security standard but it's

445
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:54,149
not yeah it has nothing to do with

446
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:59,699
product security and that's maybe how

447
00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:01,890
they run their mail server maybe but not

448
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,360
how they do pacemakers just keep this in

449
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:10,500
mind this certification it's not for

450
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,149
product security okay but what was

451
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,010
special yeah because it's just a project

452
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,200
with a lot of security vulnerabilities

453
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,450
that's no magic done you've seen it's

454
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,970
not the best hacking you need for the

455
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,130
stuff vulnerability disclosure and

456
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,740
that's actually I think why I'm here

457
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,570
today and the next days to talk to you

458
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:34,770
about what's a good way of an ability

459
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:37,260
disclosure okay what was special the

460
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,450
guys they have me and I thought we do

461
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,260
the traditional way yeah we do some

462
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,510
research go to big conferences talk to a

463
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,690
big crowd and everybody will come to us

464
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,059
and buy the services we sell they did it

465
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,870
differently this day licensed the

466
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:56,760
research to an investment company and

467
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,850
the investment company took a short

468
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,610
position insane truth medically and

469
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,100
purchase from competitors this means

470
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,080
they published a report with all the

471
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,469
findings in there not the technical

472
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:14,460
details but with the findings in there

473
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:17,760
and explained how these kind of findings

474
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:22,020
will affect the stock market price from

475
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,929
offs and shoot so vulnerability disclose

476
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,929
approach the process no there was no

477
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,610
notification notification to the vendor

478
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:32,740
previously because there is a history

479
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,928
attached to this vendor yeah

480
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,940
this vendor was accused the same

481
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:43,450
vulnerabilities by a by a guy core

482
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,179
called Barnaby check a couple of years

483
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:50,320
ago but they were never made public

484
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:51,910
because Barnaby check died so the

485
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,040
research in this area kind of cut stock

486
00:24:51,910 --> 00:25:00,160
and so they said now since youth mmm

487
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:04,230
they keep denying this stuff and yeah

488
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,230
which would be just some litigation

489
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:10,389
let's just public let's just partner

490
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:14,380
with muddy waters because they are good

491
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:16,809
at making these bad Bender's pay for the

492
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,290
harm that they do it's like a kind of a

493
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:22,540
Robin Hood story they want to sell you

494
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,639
and as mentioned the set a very big

495
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,678
impact because on the day the

496
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,980
information was released the stock

497
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,360
market dropped 12% which means two

498
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:36,030
billion dollars yeah

499
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:40,510
it's five million it's a very big number

500
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:43,000
and I think it's the first time this was

501
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,140
done for vulnerability disclosure and

502
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,320
from monetizing vulnerabilities and I

503
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:54,070
think a quite big one and then it all

504
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,260
started yeah because st. Jude started to

505
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,629
deny the stuff they said okay this

506
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,410
reached researchers they just want to

507
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:04,000
make money out of us it's there delete

508
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,520
the results of Falls they're made up

509
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,190
that everything not true let's sue them

510
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:14,020
and they sued a lot of the persons

511
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,429
involved like Mary waters the CEO the

512
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,650
doctors that were involved in this

513
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:22,660
project and in October because assume

514
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:27,450
the report was published in August and

515
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:30,460
in October we had a third-party

516
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,950
independent third party to just recheck

517
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,980
what the work we did and it was an

518
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:39,160
expert team from Bishop Fox and us-based

519
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:42,910
cybersecurity compre company and they

520
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,760
verified every claim we made so we were

521
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,750
ready to go and said okay we didn't made

522
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,879
it up

523
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:54,190
somebody has to take actions and a

524
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,309
couple months later the ics-cert

525
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,880
released vulnerability note and also the

526
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:03,990
FDA released vulnerability note together

527
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,000
with a first update for cybersecurity

528
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,980
and sent Ruth to say they are very proud

529
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,980
of our security we are leading the way

530
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,220
but it's not true because the update was

531
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,990
just for communication between the

532
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,549
Merlin and the cloud because this was

533
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,940
done unencrypted in the past and they

534
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:24,340
just put certificates on there so that's

535
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,830
not the update we want it to happen

536
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,059
because the PageMaker communication the

537
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:36,549
wireless communication was still

538
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:40,600
unpatched also fun stuff because there

539
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:43,200
is a German a nice phrasing for to de

540
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,570
shocks yeah you see up gabay una mezcla

541
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,970
stimulations in pull Z it's the proper

542
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:54,939
word the medical term for I will kill

543
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:59,620
you with this shock yeah so everything

544
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:03,299
is a kind of phrasing yeah a little bit

545
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,860
later down the road the FDA also took

546
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,250
reboot the information and they made an

547
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,389
official statement so ok he said ah

548
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:13,960
that's true what they are what they are

549
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:16,600
claiming that's possible st. Jude you

550
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:22,059
need to do a second update yeah and they

551
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:25,780
did nearly one year later the final

552
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:28,690
update came out with which also targeted

553
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,840
the insecure communication I never

554
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,100
retested the stuff but I think there

555
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,649
were a lot of knowledgeable people

556
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:41,080
involved so this might be good and we

557
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,010
are back at the beginning it ended in a

558
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:49,629
big recall with more than 500,000

559
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:50,890
pacemakers so I think that's kind of a

560
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,960
interesting way

561
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,870
but vulnerability disclosure yeah we

562
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,070
have now the way we just push it out and

563
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,909
make the vendor pay but

564
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:05,460
funny stuff is that nearly at the same

565
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,680
time two other researchers from America

566
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,350
Billy Reyes and Jonathan Patz from white

567
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,930
cop they're also into medical device

568
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,480
security and they reviewed pacemakers

569
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:18,270
from a form another vendor called

570
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,830
Medtronic so they did a security

571
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,210
assessment and they also found a lot of

572
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,090
packs and vulnerabilities in there

573
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,370
especially in the ecosystem so they were

574
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:31,610
able to deploy their own firmware I

575
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:35,209
think on the pacemakers using the

576
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:38,520
software delivery system of Medtronic

577
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:41,060
they disclosed it to the vendor and try

578
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:47,910
to work with the vendor to fix it and

579
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:49,590
you have a new mental response so they

580
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,820
also they reviewed it because they have

581
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,760
an internal vulnerability disclosure

582
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:58,740
process but they found this is no new

583
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:02,700
potential safety risk so it's no problem

584
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,010
if you are able to deployed a firmware

585
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,230
on a large scale to the pacemakers

586
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:11,460
that's no problem for them has nothing

587
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:13,920
to do with safety and that's what very

588
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,170
often in in this position when you a

589
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,380
security researcher talk to vendors then

590
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:22,260
they are not used to talk to security

591
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,750
researchers and they try to downplay the

592
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,710
findings they don't talk to you they

593
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:33,060
will come up with a lot of stories just

594
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:35,690
to don't fix the vulnerabilities and one

595
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,970
of the guys I think Jonathan bat said

596
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,800
for the time they just talked about the

597
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,860
box with Medtronic they could easily

598
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,129
just fixed it yeah it's just a question

599
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:50,070
of they won't admit they made a failure

600
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:54,630
because this would affect maybe the new

601
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:57,510
regulations the maybe that the payment

602
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:59,820
from the CEO I don't know but it's very

603
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:03,870
very frustrating also for them because

604
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:06,179
two years later the vulnerabilities were

605
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:11,669
still in there and there was no patch

606
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:15,740
out so they were in the situation

607
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:17,820
or still discussing with the vendor so

608
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,370
this leads me to the point what is the

609
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:24,590
better way because that's the

610
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:28,129
traditional way and I think the more

611
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:31,679
yeah ethically way in the broad

612
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,420
perception when you get go to the the

613
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,900
first approach you have one year later

614
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,850
you have an update sounds not the

615
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,120
traditional ethical way but a very

616
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,120
effective way to do it so what is the

617
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,449
better better way I don't know first in

618
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,570
this project I was pretty pissed because

619
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:54,570
I wasn't expecting this way if we

620
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:57,899
believe the disclosure and yeah then

621
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:04,350
lawsuit started so it was not the best

622
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:06,750
time but now I think more open about the

623
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,990
way they took maybe this was a good

624
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:13,080
approach I'm not sure and I'm open to

625
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:19,350
discuss afterwards give me give me your

626
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:23,149
thoughts on this in the Q&A let's sum it

627
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:26,129
up key takeaways so first point in

628
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,930
medical or in general is safety in

629
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,020
security if it's not secure it's not

630
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:34,650
safe keep this in mind there is no

631
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:38,220
safety without security and security is

632
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:41,070
not ISO 27001 certified yeah that's not

633
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:44,520
equal I am secure especially not if it

634
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,340
comes to product security there are some

635
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,440
new regulations out there you need to do

636
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,379
now cyber security risk assessments if

637
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,450
you build a new security product we're

638
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,350
working with vendors doing this stuff

639
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:02,400
but I think there is a lot of room for

640
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,409
improvement still problems they have

641
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,450
lots of potential new attack vectors

642
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,690
yeah it's like you've seen you have a

643
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,700
pacemaker a programmer a cloud maybe

644
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,370
there are some apps in the future maybe

645
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,380
there is a lot of interconnected stuff

646
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,199
so it's getting getting more complex

647
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,540
also for medical devices so you need to

648
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,180
cover every potential attack vector yeah

649
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,799
also the the cheap end-user devices

650
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,330
maybe there are the

651
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,499
his point and they went into the

652
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:33,418
ecosystem also this way was a new way of

653
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:37,320
monetizing vulnerabilities it was the

654
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:39,360
first time and with a big hit especially

655
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,730
on the media in the American media and

656
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,678
it started a huge discussion about

657
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,539
ethics and would ability disclosure

658
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,499
again it's great I think in enforcing

659
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:51,450
every couple of years there's a

660
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:53,369
discussion about how to do proper

661
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:56,940
vulnerability disclosure and I think

662
00:33:53,369 --> 00:34:02,189
there is no one way it depends yeah the

663
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:04,080
answer from our consultant okay then one

664
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,509
last thing why this picture because it's

665
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:11,808
my favorite picture in information

666
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:16,679
security let me explain this picture

667
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:18,179
symbolizes my experience in the project

668
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,970
because first you start you have a look

669
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,040
at it upfront you think okay

670
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:25,770
seems properly secured there might be a

671
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,009
way to climb above and do some stuff but

672
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,168
it's a hard way and yeah maybe they have

673
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,000
done a good job but if you switch your

674
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:37,109
perspectives and take a different angle

675
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,869
one step by the to the to the side at to

676
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:42,089
stay with this picture it gets much much

677
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:45,480
easier easier so you have to really

678
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:47,129
cover every angle of your product don't

679
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:53,159
go down the rabbit holes in security

680
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:56,009
research try to take a step back get a

681
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,130
new look on your problem and maybe there

682
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:02,369
is an easier way just right next to the

683
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:04,650
way you're in so I don't think because

684
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,859
you just you invested twenty days of

685
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:11,760
research on this protocol maybe there's

686
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:15,240
a second protocol also built in that's

687
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,970
much easier to do okay so that's my

688
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,640
journey that's the story I wanted to

689
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,279
share with you I hope you enjoyed it if

690
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,118
you have some questions please ask them

691
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,280
now and I will be also around afterwards

692
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,680
and the next days to talk about this

693
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:41,320
thank you very much

694
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:43,940
[Applause]

695
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,900
thank you so much to be us so we have

696
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,580
microphone angels over there maybe yes

697
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,820
he's waving his hand we have a

698
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:56,660
microphone angel over there and we have

699
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,400
questions from the internet perhaps no

700
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:02,720
it questions from the internet internet

701
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,340
step up your game so over here just

702
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,180
about a legal situation the first

703
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:10,430
question they just sued for defamation

704
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,830
libel something like this like you were

705
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,740
lying but isn't there also an aspect of

706
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,660
manipulating the stock market that

707
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,290
that's the point yeah they claimed

708
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,020
because due to this false information

709
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:25,240
they manipulated the stock market yeah

710
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:28,660
I'm no expert in the law stuff

711
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,250
especially not in the American ones but

712
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,049
long story short that's not insider

713
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,750
trading yeah that's what everybody

714
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,730
usually asks because there is no inside

715
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,280
information taking it's a proper way to

716
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,380
just have a look at the books of a

717
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,390
company to do your own research and to

718
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:48,650
an evolution and say okay we think this

719
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:53,330
company has no outlook on the market

720
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:56,869
we'd bet against the desktop okay

721
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,390
another question from the sign thank you

722
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:03,470
you didn't discuss the role of the FDA

723
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:06,980
and in my experience also in cardiology

724
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:10,069
we had a lot of outdated amplifiers

725
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:12,200
because they were they had to

726
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,000
certification and they will still be

727
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,830
used even though we could build better

728
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,660
ones and I think this is one of the

729
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:21,340
places where it is also close place is

730
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:24,589
that the they had the system that was

731
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:29,780
allowed on the market and it is an

732
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:32,540
enormous investment to read certify it

733
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,150
at the FDA and I think that's the reason

734
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:37,850
why they took a shortcut and I think

735
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,730
it's unless this whole system with the

736
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,950
FDA changes its it's unavoidable that

737
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,140
this kind of part of keep on the market

738
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:47,960
all right so the impact of the

739
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:52,730
certification process yes that's a very

740
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:55,220
very good point and I'm completely with

741
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:58,070
you but I think there is

742
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,259
movement yeah they acknowledged that's a

743
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:03,710
problem and they will need to do a

744
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,920
different kind of different process how

745
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,410
to get updates out or to get security

746
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,350
updates out yet you need to do some kind

747
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,920
of separation between safety related

748
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:19,730
systems and other systems but they're on

749
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,650
it yeah but I think now it's still very

750
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,350
like the old system but they're at least

751
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:27,530
thinking about it and I know from some

752
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:29,990
very well-known and popular security

753
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:33,590
experts they are talking to them giving

754
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:38,839
them input how to come up with a better

755
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:40,670
solution right great story I don't know

756
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,040
if my question is too easy or too hard

757
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:45,170
because I'm not really in the sector and

758
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,410
sim but I was wondering when the zero

759
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:53,240
day exploit was disclosed publicly if

760
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:56,060
somebody would have maybe in the next

761
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,330
week used it to cause real harm to a

762
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:04,360
patient how is it likely that the

763
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:07,670
company would have tried to sue you okay

764
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,410
good question but I think that's an easy

765
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,050
one to answer because that's maybe my

766
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:14,299
fault we didn't release proof of concept

767
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,040
code we just said okay there is a

768
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,650
vulnerability have a look at this video

769
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,390
this video proves that there is a that

770
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:25,220
there is a vulnerability in there we

771
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:30,620
never put out the real code to make it

772
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:33,049
happen but to elaborate on this what is

773
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:36,440
the potential the worst impact you can

774
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:38,540
generate to kill someone but there are

775
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,150
other ways to kill people and you don't

776
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:43,820
need to do pacemaker hacking you just

777
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:46,760
shoot them or strangle them or run them

778
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,460
over by a car if you're not politically

779
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,400
exposed person I think that's maybe not

780
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,790
your most the the major concern of

781
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,520
getting killed by a random hacker yeah

782
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:01,520
if you have other problems but for

783
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,180
especially exposed persons this might be

784
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,190
a way yeah do we have any questions from

785
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,160
the internet now

786
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:14,900
still internet come on

787
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:18,980
I see a question over here okay you sets

788
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:22,310
they had to cut 36 bit eres a down to 24

789
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,160
because of the low power hardware so how

790
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:28,240
do you think they were able to fix it

791
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,770
with this hardware the proper algorithm

792
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,009
yeah that's why I always mention it I

793
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:36,740
don't didn't retest retest it and I had

794
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:39,890
a look at a lot of the code and I'm

795
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:42,560
curious by myself but I think they

796
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,839
needed I think there is still a way in

797
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,360
there how to get the kind of a backup

798
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,860
access I think they just change codes

799
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,890
and protected them a little bit better

800
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,540
but if you have the same hardware you

801
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,790
have the same hardware yeah you you

802
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,940
can't just do a different register size

803
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:01,190
and switch from two different key

804
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,590
lengths I think that's not possible but

805
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:10,910
I think maybe they did some compensative

806
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:12,710
measures in there yeah yeah our very

807
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,160
popular microphone angel over here has

808
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,200
yet another customer yes you were

809
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,870
talking about the US legal system I

810
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,450
assume I just want to add that if you

811
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,920
were working in Europe or especially in

812
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,730
Germany you would have problems with the

813
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,780
OHIP arrest which is like copyright law

814
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,970
when reverse engineering

815
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,610
there was a great talk on the last

816
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,620
Congress about two research groups from

817
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,300
Berlin and Munich running into

818
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,609
difficulties and they are being sued on

819
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,440
the basis of copyright so be careful

820
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:48,260
around there I have to follow up on this

821
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,720
the law changed this year so it's better

822
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,580
now for researchers but what I what I

823
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,589
wanted to ask yeah great thanks to the

824
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,720
you what I want to ask that you look

825
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,760
it's the CPU so what hardware is inside

826
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,520
these things this is very so low-power

827
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:07,120
or what is it

828
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:09,530
they have custom chips so but it's I

829
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,990
can't remember the the specific

830
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,630
processor but I can look it up if you

831
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:18,169
want yeah but but they did a custom

832
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:20,869
solution for the stuff could it be that

833
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,240
our lonely microphone angel has found

834
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:25,190
yes a question just a very short

835
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,479
question so how much money did Muddy

836
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:31,759
Waters make out of this I was I'm still

837
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,940
curious by myself there are no numbers

838
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:37,190
out I just know that I didn't get paid

839
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,869
for all of my work yeah because as soon

840
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,210
as they get got suit

841
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:43,099
they froze all accounts and they set it

842
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:45,859
up long term because the company was

843
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:48,619
founded in Saint Kitts and Nevis that's

844
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:52,940
an island in the Caribbean Sea not even

845
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:55,640
in the US and they once explained me by

846
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,589
beer they had every lawyer on this

847
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,650
island so they can't be sued by an

848
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:03,558
lawyer from this island so they had a

849
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:05,509
plan in mind already but I don't know

850
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,990
how much money they made I think their

851
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:11,210
plan didn't work out as they wanted it

852
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:15,019
because the the stock mark the stock

853
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:19,249
price recovered as well but I think it

854
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:22,279
was a huge outburst of curiosity at the

855
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:26,238
beginning because dropping by to me to

856
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:28,279
billions and there were there was a

857
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:32,319
merger ongoing st. Ruth was bought by

858
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:35,539
Abbott so I think that was not the best

859
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,450
time frame and to get hit by such a

860
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:42,200
market drop I see all right we have time

861
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:48,649
for one more is it gonna come from the

862
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:50,419
internet oh all right any one else no

863
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,960
then please

864
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:57,349
another great warm heartfelt
