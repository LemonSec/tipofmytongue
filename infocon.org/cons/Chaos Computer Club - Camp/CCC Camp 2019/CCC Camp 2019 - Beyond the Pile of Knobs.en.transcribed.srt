2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,369
this next talk is going to be in English

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,340
but the next talk is going to have a

4
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:23,619
French translation so pushing because

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,580
sometimes you know in Turkish on phone

6
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:29,110
sales so especially if you're watching

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,919
the live stream or the recording later

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,780
on

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,010
feel free to switch the audio track to

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:39,280
French a couple of announcements before

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,890
we start the actual torque is please

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,460
don't steal the toilet brushes they are

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,930
needed on the toilets and nowhere else

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,989
additionally please don't smoke in any

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:59,050
of the camp tents smoking is strictly

16
00:00:49,989 --> 00:01:02,290
prohibited on in all of the tents all

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,519
right since we're right on time to start

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,090
this next talk I'm gonna keep this

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,479
introduction short I'm very happy to

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,300
introduce to you Molly Wilson and I need

21
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,200
partner who are going to talk about

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,679
beyond the pile of knobs

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,219
really

24
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:23,289
redesigning no scripts UX it's always

25
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:26,798
very interesting to see like these

26
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:29,049
security tools evolve when it comes to

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,329
usability and user experience so I'm

28
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,209
very happy to see this progress in that

29
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,649
area so I'm very much looking forward to

30
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,299
see what Eileen and Molly are going to

31
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:45,569
talk about please welcome them with a

32
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:48,130
warm round of applause thank you hi

33
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,840
thank you so much for coming we're

34
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,479
really excited to present what we're

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,390
calling beyond the pile of knobs a

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,880
design case study we're gonna talk about

37
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,189
how we were to redesign the UX of no

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,500
script browser content blocking

39
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,119
extension but we're not just talking

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,390
about no script this is a case study

41
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:10,628
that we hope points to design tools and

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,700
processes that are useful for a lot of

43
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:14,440
different open source projects and

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,268
particularly projects that are really

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,950
complex and are geared towards power

46
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:24,069
users so hi I'm Molly I'm Eileen and

47
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,470
this is our teammate Lorraine she can't

48
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:33,970
be here with us she's in Toronto heather

49
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:35,530
aid we first question you may have when

50
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,530
we redesigned no script is what about

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,630
that logo the no script logo is famous

52
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,849
it's an icon it's been around for a

53
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:49,299
while well ladies and gentlemen dunno

54
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:52,899
script logo Hey

55
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:56,230
same ass new facial expression I don't

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,340
know this is how the no script you I

57
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,200
used to look very small text looks a

58
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,910
little bit outdated it's not super

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:11,828
consistent new UI whoa greyscale

60
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,530
consistency rounded corners you might

61
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,840
call it clear clean kind of modern right

62
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,380
Wow it looks good yeah we're very

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,519
pleased with ourselves this is the least

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,799
important part when we talk about design

65
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,970
making it look nicer is not what we are

66
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,610
talking about

67
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,070
that's the icing on the cake that's what

68
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,020
you can do once you have done all of the

69
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,420
other steps that we're gonna talk about

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,960
we're not talking about the UI changes

71
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,609
we're talking about the deep methods and

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,630
processes that you need to use before

73
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:48,670
you can even embark on doing that so

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,799
we're gonna show you really how we got

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,709
there and present tools and methods that

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:59,260
you too can use for designing open

77
00:03:53,710 --> 00:04:02,170
source project right but before we do

78
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,170
that just a couple of words about why

79
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,359
we're doing this um the short answer is

80
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,970
no script is great no script is awesome

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,280
right no script today it's been around

82
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,500
for some time now it's actually it was

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,108
born in May 2005 so it's one of the

84
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,600
older browser extensions out there

85
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:23,890
it currently has 1.5 million users on

86
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,480
Firefox 50k users on Chrome growing plus

87
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,310
of course all of the poor brow tor

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,810
browser users which last time I checked

89
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:38,830
was around 2.5 million officially of

90
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:41,590
course mmm jamming key here we go can

91
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,510
you help me out there thank you it's not

92
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,820
just used by you know what we think of

93
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,680
you know privacy advocates activists

94
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,979
researchers it's actually used by

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,030
governments and corporations alike a lot

96
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,560
of the people that we reached out to

97
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,580
during our testing phase for example

98
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:01,600
were you know working for governments of

99
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,609
course what also happens is the clicker

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,390
doesn't work should we just do this

101
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,550
instead what also happens is no script

102
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,380
has actually contributed to a lot of

103
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,280
other security browser extensions such

104
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,710
as HTTPS Everywhere it was the first and

105
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,210
is now in fact also the only protection

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,310
the client-side protection you have

107
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:25,330
against cross-site scripting attacks and

108
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,550
the last thing I want to mention here is

109
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,010
Douglas Crockford who is a main

110
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,040
contributor to JavaScript itself who

111
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,810
actually invented the JSON format also

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,760
recommends using no script right so no

113
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,950
script is not something that people who

114
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,880
hate JavaScript use no script is

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,620
something that people who love

116
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:51,190
JavaScript also use

117
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:52,630
um the things that it's just the

118
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,370
challenges for nose group that we see

119
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,750
are not just challenges for no script

120
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,360
they're actually pretty common for a lot

121
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,510
of projects we see and the free and open

122
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,400
source software scene no script is run

123
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,289
by one developer and a whole community

124
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,880
of enthusiastic users right so it was

125
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,740
one person who built us at some point

126
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,120
and then a lot of people start talking

127
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,830
about it and giving feedback it also is

128
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,460
started by someone who mainly built it

129
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,169
for himself

130
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,840
he says I built it for myself and I will

131
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:22,080
always make it work for me first that's

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,479
where a lot of the projects we work with

133
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,120
actually come from what they also think

134
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,830
is I want everyone to use these tools

135
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,590
right everyone deserves the privacy and

136
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,229
security that I have so a lot of fast

137
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,698
projects want to be there but of course

138
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,020
there is a tension right because if

139
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:39,310
you're always building for yourself

140
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,930
first then how can you make sure

141
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,030
everyone else is using it when everybody

142
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,650
else has very different needs and is not

143
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:50,679
necessarily a developer so what happened

144
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,260
a lot is there were a lot of feedback

145
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,910
and you know future requests there's

146
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,889
like things that came in over the years

147
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,450
that were really unstructured and no

148
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,400
script changed based on these sort of

149
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,389
unstructured feedback and was adapting

150
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,219
to it very quickly over again 14 years

151
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,770
it has you know developed into a huge

152
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,870
project that has many different aspects

153
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,990
to it that don't necessarily connect as

154
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,180
smoothly as you would want it to so what

155
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,070
it actually leads to is something that

156
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,830
multi because of the ICO McMansion

157
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,150
design I'm from the US and in the US we

158
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,190
have this genre of house called a

159
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,400
McMansion which is basically a house

160
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,469
with design feature creep it's like I

161
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,570
want this feature I want this one I want

162
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,190
this one too and you end up putting all

163
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,560
of these features on making your house

164
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,430
as big ostentatious and feature-rich as

165
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,169
possible but the whole thing together

166
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,880
doesn't look good and maybe isn't even

167
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,710
that usable there's this great blog

168
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,449
called McMansion hell that points out

169
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,609
how exactly this works in architecture

170
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,349
here we got pretty sure this window

171
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,780
opens up to either nothing or a very

172
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,360
short and tiny room hey we have some

173
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,508
space left over why don't we attend

174
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,610
smaller yet uglier house if you also are

175
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,250
a fan of good and bad architecture

176
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,610
definitely check out make a mansion hell

177
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,830
so there's not an option not to design

178
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,840
whatever you're working on there is no

179
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,508
such thing as no design when you are

180
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,758
building it you are also designing it so

181
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,770
what we'd like to introduce is the

182
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,650
process of the methodology the method

183
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:24,719
behind the madness that we use to make

184
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:26,938
design make sense overall here's what

185
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:30,569
our process looks like and four big

186
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,339
steps first we research we learn about

187
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,560
the problem space we learn about the

188
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,050
existing tool about the community about

189
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,088
the people who use it what do they need

190
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,208
what's going on there and then we

191
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,919
synthesize that down to a statement that

192
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,079
clarifies what is it we're actually

193
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,819
going to do what are the core problems

194
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,410
we're solving and what is not so

195
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,660
important to solve right now this is

196
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,779
also about prioritization then we

197
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,060
prototype and that prototyping is often

198
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,589
rough quick dirty we want to do this as

199
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,660
cheaply and quickly and iteratively as

200
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:03,720
possible and then usability testing test

201
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,269
with users so it's really important that

202
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,420
this goes fairly fast it's important

203
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:11,010
that this is not actually super

204
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,349
expensive and it's really important that

205
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,490
this is centered on the community it's

206
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,980
centered on the users

207
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,690
so we focus on user needs by conducting

208
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,690
user interviews at the beginning by

209
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,160
doing usability tests at the web as soon

210
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,199
as we have a prototype to test and

211
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,540
getting rich qualitative feedback

212
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:31,949
throughout our goal is that this tool

213
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,170
makes sense to people why are we

214
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,180
building it because we want people to be

215
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,849
able to use it we want to know what do

216
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:43,800
people want what do people need and what

217
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:46,079
can people actually use so for example

218
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,529
in our interview phase we interviewed

219
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:52,319
two novice users and for power users our

220
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:56,310
classification not theirs and we got

221
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,040
rich qualitative feedback ample one of

222
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,810
our novice users said if I hadn't found

223
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,360
the right thing to try to turn off after

224
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,149
the second try I am just going to turn

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,120
no script off one of our power users

226
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,550
just

227
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,500
bribed how they rely on no script no

228
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,120
script is the last line or defense in my

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,410
browser I trust it to be working in my

230
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,060
interest at all times

231
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,279
this is a lot more than we would have

232
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,829
found out from asking people do you like

233
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,050
no script yes no giving them a survey

234
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,870
collecting some kind of data which no

235
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,819
script doesn't do and will never do we

236
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,920
this is why we chose to focus on this

237
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,089
rich qualitative feedback with actual

238
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,310
people we then analyzed that by

239
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,500
collecting these quotations and putting

240
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,750
them on a virtual post-it note board we

241
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,520
organized them by theme we figured out

242
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,200
what we thought where we did some

243
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,770
prioritization talk more about that in a

244
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,620
bit and we built rough prototypes going

245
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,029
from paper to wireframes to sort of a

246
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,040
click through prototype that gives you

247
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,600
an idea of the interaction we tested

248
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,099
this before people in total at different

249
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,050
stages we gathered feedback and that's

250
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,060
how we did it now we want to dive more

251
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,319
into what we did and specifically how

252
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,819
this looks for no script if you're

253
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,020
thinking yeah yeah yeah user centered

254
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,060
design process I've heard that before

255
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,829
but it's not applicable to us this is

256
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,560
too complicated this is too technical

257
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,000
this is for power users this is exactly

258
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,130
what no script is so we're going to show

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,050
you how this works in that context first

260
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,779
we're going to talk about framing so

261
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,380
what is this tool do and who does it do

262
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,839
that for first it was important for us

263
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,779
to understand what kind of content

264
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,970
blocking actually exists already the

265
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,279
landscape of browser-based content

266
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,440
blocking is pretty big pretty crowded

267
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,000
which is a good thing we think that you

268
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,730
know should be the case this would have

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,040
looked very different ten years ago so

270
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:48,730
we've got ad blockers where the goal is

271
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,760
to deliver a cleaner like end user

272
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:55,000
experience without ads we've got privacy

273
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,020
where the goal is to have less tracking

274
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
of your personal web browsing behavior

275
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,819
we've got security where the goal of

276
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,830
these tools is preventing malware and

277
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,300
we've got reducing cruft

278
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,360
which is sort of a more efficient

279
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,689
experience making making for example

280
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,860
just faster load times and yeah

281
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,959
eliminating unnecessary scripts

282
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,920
something like privacy badger is in a

283
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,099
very different space

284
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,529
no script no script is kind of alone in

285
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,060
this area of it helps with security and

286
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,070
also just helps make a more efficient

287
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,959
browsing experience once we realized

288
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,519
that was what it was doing as opposed to

289
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,930
a lot of the other things people might

290
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,899
conflate it with if they didn't know too

291
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,540
much about it we put together three

292
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:43,089
different personas and these personas

293
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,980
are like aggregates of people that we

294
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,779
talked to the reason we're not using

295
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,760
actual people well first of all we

296
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,310
promised them confidentiality this lets

297
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,170
us aggregate the data and not and

298
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,638
protect the actual details of the folks

299
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,040
we talked to some of them work in rather

300
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,190
sensitive places but also it gives us an

301
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,019
idea of the kinds of people who might

302
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,420
come how be attracted to no script we

303
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,220
didn't include anything for no secret to

304
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,599
what's that I don't even care everybody

305
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,970
can see everything like that's just

306
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,510
that's not relevant here so starting

307
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,910
with ROS the superuser ROS is somebody

308
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,490
who uses no script because it makes her

309
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,160
feel safe online and not using no script

310
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,560
makes her feel exposed online she's a

311
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,170
security trainer as well and recommends

312
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,018
no script selectively to people who can

313
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,550
cope with having this much control for

314
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:35,560
many people she says it's just too

315
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:37,779
interactive it's too much ml the privacy

316
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,109
advocate what about his use of no script

317
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:43,689
he advocates tirelessly for no script he

318
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,180
tells everybody to use no script but he

319
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,800
does not use it all the time himself he

320
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,870
does not use it if pages break too

321
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,599
frequently he turns it off and then

322
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,279
leaves it off for a while and he really

323
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,079
really wishes it were easier to use

324
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,820
because he's going around telling

325
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,949
everybody else to use it he knows it's

326
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:05,350
the best his words next Chris the

327
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:07,719
curious Chris the curious is kind of

328
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,240
generally paranoid does not trust a big

329
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,089
tech really does not like the idea that

330
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,750
he's being tracked online really does

331
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:19,120
not like seeing ads however he tried no

332
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,870
script once he could not figure it out

333
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,639
and he uninstalled it he would love no

334
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,740
script to decide which scripts are

335
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,240
unsafe and blocked them automatically

336
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:33,140
he doesn't like having to make this

337
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,440
decision every time a page loads so

338
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,899
who do we prioritize it might be

339
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,140
important to know that no script is

340
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,380
never ever going to provide a block list

341
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,449
that's just not something this tool does

342
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,060
no script is absolutely not interested

343
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,100
in collecting user data and really not

344
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,290
interested in using any kind of machine

345
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,779
learning on aggregated data to be smart

346
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,360
no script is going to be dumb no script

347
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:02,329
that's just that's part of its DNA and

348
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,810
will always be the case so who is no

349
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:09,529
script for no script is for Rose the

350
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,689
Super User it's not for everybody and we

351
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:17,120
made the decision fairly early on to

352
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:19,790
deprioritize these other users next so

353
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,459
what is what is no script really do it

354
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,870
for whom it keeps you safe nah not

355
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:27,140
really not if you don't know how to use

356
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,510
it what about no script makes safe

357
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,490
browsing easy for everyone hmm for those

358
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,779
other two personas probably no script is

359
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,160
not actually the way to keep them the

360
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,950
safest because of their knowledge and

361
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,890
behavior next does it make safe browsing

362
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,070
easy for power users no I wouldn't say

363
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:46,670
no script makes anything easy what does

364
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,649
no script do it buys power users time to

365
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,750
make informed decisions about who they

366
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:53,480
trust we really need to know this in

367
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,990
order to do a good job designing it so

368
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,730
no script is a tool for power users it's

369
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,440
a tool for creating friction rather than

370
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,269
removing friction it is strict by

371
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,940
default and it is a tool that you have

372
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,860
to interact with every time from the

373
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,230
beginning it's not a set and forget type

374
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,930
of tool this makes it basically the

375
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,930
spend Marquart of content blocking

376
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,230
Rick is off

377
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,970
switch mics should we switch mics

378
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:09,890
use we have another microphone already I

379
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:13,190
think it's number two yes wonderful

380
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,920
thank you so much so now now that we

381
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,839
know who know script is for our next

382
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,330
step in this process was saying well

383
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,389
asking the question what does rows that

384
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,159
power user actually need and this part

385
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,730
you know it's it's kind of funny people

386
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,660
always think oh it's a power user so

387
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,700
transparency we need to know all the

388
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:35,270
things information needs to be there and

389
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,770
visible customizability all the things

390
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,470
need to be able to be changed right

391
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,810
because we have a power user here well

392
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,690
that may be true but it's really no

393
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,360
excuse for this right this is what our

394
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,330
friend Susan Farrell would call a pile

395
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,070
of knobs right I don't when I am trying

396
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,280
to configure something I don't want to

397
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,870
be confronted with a pile of knobs and

398
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,570
let's just take this idea of

399
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,540
customizability kind of to the logical

400
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:06,139
consequence its logical conclusion which

401
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,740
is offer everybody all the options well

402
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,870
let's think about what these options are

403
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,640
so here's what a person needs to

404
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:17,060
understand a power user needs to

405
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,490
understand to use no script right look

406
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,540
at those red words those are the things

407
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,240
the elements of this tool when you visit

408
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,290
a site it can load a script these

409
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,420
scripts can be from the site you visit

410
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,030
or from a different source we call these

411
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,810
different sources the script owner

412
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,430
that's number three with no script you

413
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,790
can decide on what gets loaded into your

414
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:43,250
browser you can block or allow scripts

415
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,560
deciding about what to block how to

416
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,480
block it that requires a lot of

417
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,870
knowledge about scripts and their owners

418
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,400
so you have three kind of base elements

419
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,860
and then you have two action verbs on

420
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,820
top of that and then you have a bunch of

421
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,770
background knowledge so let's say we're

422
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,179
visiting the New York Times this is

423
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,790
actually from the New York Times I

424
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,740
picked out seven scripts that you could

425
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,600
actually load into your browser when you

426
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,290
visit the New York Times you can see

427
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,709
there's New York Times com static zero

428
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:18,239
one dot New York Times com could we

429
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,950
just so yeah that's that's the first

430
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:23,429
party scripts right so scripts actually

431
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,919
owned by New York Times note that you

432
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,719
know and y-t-dot-com is also owned by

433
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,419
New York Times but the URL is actually

434
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:32,369
not exactly the same one right and then

435
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,859
we have some Google products we have

436
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:37,049
news Google com we have Google tag

437
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,239
manager come again not the same URL and

438
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,339
some people some people might know that

439
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:42,599
double-click is also owned by Google

440
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,700
right so that's all the Google

441
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,559
infrastructure you see but then there

442
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,969
also types of script you know you know

443
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,729
that the first three might probably be

444
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:53,580
content and then after that we probably

445
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:56,789
have some trackers double-click is

446
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,149
definitely an ad serving script and

447
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:01,440
Optimizely does a/b testing again things

448
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:03,359
you could know if you looked it all up

449
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,479
but you wouldn't actually know it if

450
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,559
you're just looking at the interface

451
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:10,019
alright that's the background knowledge

452
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,489
we all need but then there's also

453
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,889
different ways of like thinking about

454
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,049
scripts writes no script itself comes

455
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,668
with eight different types of script

456
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,408
write a categorize this normal

457
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:21,479
JavaScript and then you have all the

458
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:24,539
media contents the video is on audio

459
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:26,369
files object frame font WebGL fetch

460
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,619
other these are all the different types

461
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:31,408
of scripts you can actually load into

462
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,330
your browser well and not all of the

463
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:35,070
script owners might have them right so

464
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,999
perhaps you want to say are I kind of

465
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,960
want to block scripts from

466
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:40,279
news.google.com

467
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,049
and WebGL coming from New York Times com

468
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,249
whatever I have all the options now if

469
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,830
you think about these eight different

470
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:50,099
types of scripts and let's say you have

471
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,749
n scripts on a site you actually have

472
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,700
eight and options right that's in matrix

473
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:56,009
that's a matrix of eight and options and

474
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,499
in fact if you think about the possible

475
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:00,299
combinations of those again taking block

476
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,919
and unblock as like the two dimensions

477
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,559
you can work in you have two to the

478
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,909
power of a ten that's like all the

479
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,029
different combinations you can have a

480
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,649
blocking scripts again New York Times

481
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:14,879
doesn't have just seven scripts it has

482
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:18,599
27 so we have 260 options just going on

483
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,149
a on a site that's that's not what we

484
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,229
want to be confronted with of course

485
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,289
some of these options are going to be

486
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:27,450
more salient than the others so maybe I

487
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:28,890
only want to block everything coming

488
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,260
from news.google.com

489
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,910
maybe I only want to block frames maybe

490
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,940
I only want to block things that are not

491
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:38,190
first party or affiliate it maybe i want

492
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,480
to block or allow everything or nothing

493
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,340
because i trust new york times

494
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,410
completely like there are many different

495
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,260
ways to carve out this logical space and

496
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,980
it's not clear at all you know what are

497
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:53,129
the most salient ways to do that alright

498
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,400
on top of that it's not just blocking

499
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,260
and not blocking right we have we can do

500
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,710
blocking by location we can have

501
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:06,059
blocking for this tab for this whole

502
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,860
window we can have blocking time-based

503
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,389
blocking right for this session only for

504
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,120
the next five minutes for this week

505
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,520
forever we hadn´t can have other things

506
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,928
like it's um it's on my work device so

507
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,809
I'm gonna block I'm gonna be a little

508
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:21,450
bit more you know careful about what I

509
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:24,260
allow in my work device or perhaps I

510
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,880
want to say only these sites get blocked

511
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:31,080
with those scripts and those sites you

512
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,669
know I don't care about possible too so

513
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,960
before you know it you're just visiting

514
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,730
this site and you're just like trying to

515
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,470
see some content and before you know it

516
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,760
it's it's you're playing a game of set

517
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,110
right I don't know how many of you know

518
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,410
the mathematical game but it's like

519
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,939
you're calculating five six seven

520
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,380
different dimensions of blocking and

521
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,570
really what you want is you just want to

522
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,620
see the site and that's not even fair to

523
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,939
our power user so what we did here

524
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,969
instead of thinking about possible

525
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,309
options is we started thinking about

526
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,040
scenarios scenarios of using a tool like

527
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:04,590
no script so we identified five

528
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,750
different scenarios for when no script

529
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,639
could come into play one is normal

530
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,520
browsing so you're just again reading a

531
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
new site one we call quick browsing so

532
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,760
you know say you're making a payment

533
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,740
online and things have to happen right

534
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,030
the second and everything just has to

535
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,210
work you don't care about scripts or

536
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,710
whatever the other one being we call

537
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,510
dirty browsing right you're visiting a

538
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,950
streaming site and you know everything

539
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,870
on that site is going to be really

540
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,110
really evil so you just want to like be

541
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,729
most careful about everything social

542
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,760
media use right so there is a case where

543
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,980
let's say you want to block facebook on

544
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,820
all the sites you visit except for of

545
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,480
course when you are visiting

546
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,480
facebook.com/

547
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,280
kind of like a site based blocking

548
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,649
scenario and then the last one is

549
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,149
visualization itself this is also

550
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,340
something we found out from user

551
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,070
research so a lot of people use no

552
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,470
script just to see how many scripts are

553
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,850
on a site that's something we didn't

554
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,559
know before and we realized that oh

555
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,260
actually the visualization component

556
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:08,428
component is just as important as the

557
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,900
blocking function now based on those

558
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:13,590
scenarios you can kind of think about

559
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,260
different task flows so this is how no

560
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:19,949
script wants you to use the tool you go

561
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:24,120
to a site there's a site work yes yay

562
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,799
awesome no it does not work okay well

563
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,590
you have to enable individual scripts

564
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:31,260
start with one go with another reload

565
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,959
see if it works does it work doesn't

566
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,780
work try it again

567
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,360
of course what most people do is either

568
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,299
they say well whatever I really trust

569
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,209
this site just load everything Yolo will

570
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:47,970
be fine or they go to the other extreme

571
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:52,830
which is I never wanted to see this site

572
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:54,540
anyway I'm just gonna close it so

573
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,449
basically kind of a defeat position

574
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,500
right

575
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,850
another thing we found out and our user

576
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,910
research is that people actually have a

577
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:05,219
shortcut which is trust affiliated

578
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,929
scripts and you hope it works so when I

579
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,929
say affiliated I mean kind of everything

580
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,570
that's first party ish right um can we

581
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:15,450
just go back one and I want to say no

582
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:18,990
we're in this process right do you

583
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,960
actually appreciate no script because

584
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,500
when a site works you say yay good site

585
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,210
no weird JavaScript stuff and when it

586
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,309
doesn't work is there no script is

587
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,429
blocking everything I can't like no

588
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:34,020
script interaction is by default

589
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,270
frustration right there's just no way

590
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,639
around it it's always going to bad like

591
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,049
damn you know script and thank you no

592
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,570
script but damn you no script right

593
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:45,530
there's always going to be that feeling

594
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:48,000
and how can we design something that

595
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:52,740
makes the feeling just a little bit less

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,820
awful well we tried so if you look at

597
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,680
the old UI

598
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,260
it has it has a bit you know you have

599
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,480
the list of scripts and then you have

600
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,910
the options to the left and then on the

601
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,440
top right corner you kind of have like

602
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,720
quicker global options but they're not

603
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,920
very prominent because really you know

604
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:19,730
no script doesn't want you to do all

605
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:23,330
that so what we did is new UI has a

606
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,850
couple of things that we added so first

607
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,710
of all we want to appreciate the kind of

608
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,870
quick and dirty scenarios right so we

609
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,730
have the quick and dirty options allow

610
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,560
affiliated scripts just means allow

611
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,540
first party scripts and if you have some

612
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,840
affiliated scripts that you have saved

613
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,700
before you can do that fine-tuning

614
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,560
happens in the second part right there

615
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,230
our script settings you can still see

616
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,540
all of the scripts that are loaded here

617
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,640
you can configure the scope this is

618
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:54,190
something we wanted to do and wanted to

619
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:57,620
make more visible we have a new feature

620
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,720
for site settings so that means you can

621
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,310
save settings for a site that you're

622
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,590
visiting so the whole scenario we were

623
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,169
talking about about Facebook that's

624
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,090
possible now you can save specific

625
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,290
settings for a site that you visit

626
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,980
especially those sites you visit

627
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:15,560
frequently we wanted to keep the panic

628
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,920
button the power button on the bottom

629
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,110
left because it felt like people

630
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,660
sometimes just get too frustrated and

631
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:29,479
wanted to quit everything so panic

632
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:32,030
button is there if you need it so that's

633
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,920
kind of the core of what we did we

634
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,710
really thought about what are the

635
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,180
options what are the tasks and what are

636
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,450
the things that people really needed to

637
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,400
do but then we also looked at the

638
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,850
interface and realized that a lot of the

639
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,170
confusion just came from the visuals and

640
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,889
the words that were being used in the

641
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:54,020
old interface so first of all I should

642
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,440
say that's a very common problem a lot

643
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,720
of software has that right there's a lot

644
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,410
of technical jargon inconsistent use of

645
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,780
language super ambiguous icons this is a

646
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,100
this is from a classic Apple design you

647
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,270
know have a little bomb band

648
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:13,850
you say sorry Bom sorry

649
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,700
so what's the what's the message here

650
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:19,039
right it's very unclear so these are all

651
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,110
things that we see in a lot of projects

652
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,140
and again no scrip is no exception but I

653
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,610
want to point to some specific and I

654
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,770
find interesting issues that we came

655
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,510
across with no scripts interface

656
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:34,160
language

657
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:37,720
the first one is colors so here's a

658
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,390
design question should blocking be green

659
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:45,110
good do that go right or should it be

660
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:50,419
red which we associate with bad don't do

661
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:53,750
that stop well if you go with the

662
00:28:50,419 --> 00:29:00,110
intuitive gloss it should be and go back

663
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:04,340
one it should be go is green right so

664
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:10,070
allow is green stop is red block is red

665
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:12,949
right go stop allow block if you think

666
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:15,408
about scripts though well good scripts

667
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,710
you want to allow bad scripts you want

668
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:21,590
to block hmm okay I guess block should

669
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,830
be read maybe but then no script also

670
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:27,199
really wants to recommend usage a good

671
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:30,559
security practice means block everything

672
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,960
don't allow anything that security

673
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,600
practice means well allowing everything

674
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,620
and now you're in the position where

675
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,199
block is read for some people and green

676
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,809
for other people and that's just not a

677
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,510
good place to be when you're trying to

678
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,668
use colors here right it's only going to

679
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,530
confuse people no matter what you think

680
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:54,799
the color means people will always think

681
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,600
it means something else and so here's a

682
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,429
here's a situation where we said okay we

683
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,809
don't want the red-green combination at

684
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:03,169
all because that's only going to confuse

685
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:04,700
people I should also say of course color

686
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,230
shouldn't be the only indicator when

687
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,659
you're designing things right we want to

688
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,640
make things accessible so color is

689
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:13,940
always going to be used with caution

690
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,590
when you're designing things okay the

691
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,800
other thing that we found with the

692
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:23,220
language is also really interesting so

693
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,379
a lot of interface language had double

694
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:29,490
negatives in it so something like

695
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,990
disabled restrictions globally and that

696
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,030
really that's what I mean with the

697
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,700
mental model that you're computing again

698
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,220
disabled restrictions globally so

699
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,780
they're restrictions first which is

700
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,210
already kind of a negation and then you

701
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,220
can enable or disable them okay so you

702
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,680
have to kind of do two logical operators

703
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,660
there okay well that's that just

704
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,570
requires some thinking but then there's

705
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,960
also technical and social concepts that

706
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:57,090
kind of get conflated I was talking up

707
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,880
until now about blocking and allowing

708
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:03,030
but no scripts interface actually uses

709
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,010
trusted and untrusted and again this is

710
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,840
the same same issue right you're

711
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,460
actually there's the blocking and

712
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,379
allowing on the technical level and the

713
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,110
social thing is the trusting and not

714
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,270
trusting something and the question here

715
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,850
is well if I'm allowing something do I

716
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,360
really mean that I trust it maybe maybe

717
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,129
not

718
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,360
but maybe I just need to allow it for

719
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,920
now because I need to make an online

720
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,030
payment why are you making me feel bad

721
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,770
right so there's a lot of technical and

722
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,990
social things that may or may not

723
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,820
overlap and sometimes especially when

724
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,650
you're designing for power users it's

725
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,429
probably better to just stick to the

726
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:40,890
technical concept the last thing I want

727
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,300
to mention here is the tone this is

728
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,190
something we found out in the user

729
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,950
research so again we're looking at

730
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:50,940
disable restrictions globally

731
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:54,360
parentheses dangerous now this novice

732
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,400
user we had just installed no script and

733
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,379
they looked at us and were like well

734
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,720
five minutes ago I was browsing without

735
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:05,310
it putting dangerous here makes it sound

736
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,730
like it's life-threatening yeah you want

737
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:10,710
to be you want to you know be a parent

738
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,980
sometimes but sometimes you just got to

739
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:17,190
let people do their own thing so what we

740
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,220
did instead we changed a tone we wanted

741
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,620
to keep this idea of no script is making

742
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,170
security recommendation and is also

743
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,449
sufficiently warning you when you are in

744
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,060
a bad place but we wanted to do it a

745
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,330
little bit more tongue-and-cheek lee

746
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,370
right it was supposed to be it's

747
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:37,669
don't do this you're in a dangerous

748
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:46,699
territory but no script is turn-off good

749
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:49,970
luck you're on your own here so yeah I

750
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:55,490
think that concludes my heart about

751
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:57,830
language yeah so if you would like to do

752
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,870
any of these things for any project that

753
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,659
you were working on no matter how

754
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,679
logically inconsistent or complex or

755
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,890
power user-driven

756
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,810
that tool might be we want to provide

757
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,180
you tools so that you can also go

758
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,370
through a design process and hopefully

759
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,950
make that tool that you have poured so

760
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,949
much energy into the community the

761
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,570
development actually makes sense to the

762
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,280
people that you need it that you not

763
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,129
just want but like need it to make sense

764
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,930
too we have put together a lot of

765
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,450
different templates resources methods

766
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:32,060
that you can use and in the spirit of

767
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,700
FOSS we want to put it online make it

768
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,190
available for free so this is a persona

769
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,680
template that we've developed that's

770
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,870
particularly geared around privacy

771
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,940
security and human rights protecting

772
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,280
technology that's on our website

773
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,340
there's also another template that is

774
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,980
geared towards tech tools but not

775
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,959
necessarily privacy and security what

776
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,610
you put in a persona does kind of depend

777
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,050
on the sort of tool that you're

778
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,510
designing so we have a few different

779
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,760
templates another thing that we have

780
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,530
that we've posted is a value proposition

781
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,300
generator I know the word value

782
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,418
proposition sounds really business he

783
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,790
really what this means is what is your

784
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:12,770
thing do and for whom does it do that it

785
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,989
can't do all of the things for all of

786
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,610
the people that doesn't exist what are

787
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,649
you actually trying to do and who is it

788
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,620
for and this can help you focus

789
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,690
prioritize and make sense of all the

790
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,569
like constant feedback feature requests

791
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,520
whatever that you are I'm sure getting

792
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,870
and you know what there's a lot more but

793
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,270
we're not going to use the talk time to

794
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,460
walk you through all of them because

795
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:36,530
first of all you can ask us and also we

796
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,190
hope some of its self-explanatory this

797
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:44,510
is the website simply secure org slash

798
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:45,620
UX - starter - pack and we'll also be

799
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,530
I'm sure adding to

800
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,480
in the next few days as well remember

801
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,850
there is no such thing as not doing

802
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,380
design you can't say no no no we don't

803
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,020
do design whatever decisions you're

804
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,820
making our design decisions so make them

805
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:03,380
with some kind of system make them with

806
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:06,050
some kind of method we also wanted to be

807
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,580
transparent about how much this costs we

808
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,740
really like the human centered design

809
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,450
process that we use because it can be

810
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,160
really lightweight and really cheap and

811
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,140
available to a lot of people we don't

812
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,230
think you should have to hire a fanciest

813
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,299
design agency to do this but we this was

814
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,860
not easy this took some time and here's

815
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,200
what it took about one month of

816
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,140
full-time work for two people Eileen and

817
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,450
Eileen in the rain I helped too so maybe

818
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,000
month month and a half

819
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:33,290
Lorraine is a visual designer the UI and

820
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,750
the icon that you saw that was

821
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,430
Lorraine's work I'm not a designer

822
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,900
Eileen's not a desire so don't you be

823
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:43,549
saying I'm not a designer I can't do

824
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:46,220
this additional costs we use the tools

825
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,780
we use sketch is a we use that from

826
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,390
making drawing wireframes that's like a

827
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,910
vector drawing software whimsical we

828
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:56,029
used for online collaborating on

829
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,379
wireframes notion we used a whimsical

830
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,150
was also for like collecting all of

831
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,770
these sticky notes we tried some

832
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,450
open-source tools they did not have the

833
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,820
features that we needed for this project

834
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,649
so hi somebody please make an

835
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,180
open-source tool that has the features

836
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,320
that whimsical has we would love it we

837
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,779
would use it and we would talk about it

838
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,070
all the time

839
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,080
notion we used for our internal

840
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,970
collaboration jitsi we used for remote

841
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,610
user testing and also internal

842
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,980
collaboration and tons of paper sticky

843
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,780
notes those are not cheap there's also

844
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,660
research compensation we thought it was

845
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,890
really important to at least offer

846
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,930
compensation to everybody who helped us

847
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,210
a lot of people did choose to donate

848
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,759
that given the nature of the project but

849
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:38,360
we it's really important to us that we

850
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,280
were able to offer that well I should

851
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,450
also say this work was not possible

852
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,510
without the support of the open

853
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,640
Technology Fund but more than more than

854
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,920
anybody else we need to thank giorgo for

855
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,920
letting us play around with no script

856
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,940
it's really hard when you you know you

857
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,980
know you've been working on a tool for

858
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,480
14 years and it's your baby and just to

859
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,240
give it to someone else for like you

860
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,130
know one a month and a half to to work

861
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,419
on that's that's really hard and thank

862
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,530
you so much for being open and letting

863
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,660

the rest of the week

868
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,120
if you have any questions about design

869
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:25,870
about this work or about I'll work in

870
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:28,299
general you know just ping us yeah and

871
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,220
we will help you with design whatever

872
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,220
that means to you whatever that means to

873
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,220
your project yes yeah right

874
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:44,700
all right thanks thanks so much already

875
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,050
Eileen and Molly we have a couple of

876
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,450
minutes left for questions so if you

877
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,010
have a question for either or either one

878
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,649
or both of them please come to one of

879
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,020
the microphone angels at the front or in

880
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,510
the back and ask you a question I think

881
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,120
we will start with the the lovely person

882
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,410
in front thank you thank you so much for

883
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,020
the presentation

884
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,520
I was just wondering like because I feel

885
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,920
like lots of people's first interactions

886
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,590
with no script came through like using

887
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,680
tor so I was like at one point of the

888
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:15,930
process do you think about sort of how

889
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,180
different tools interact with each other

890
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,720
and do you have to create like a special

891
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,790
persona for that or how does that go for

892
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,140
control in general or for torque for

893
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,090
like your that interact with each other

894
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,310
for example no script and tor right

895
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:33,330
because it's so that was super important

896
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:36,930
because we know that restate the

897
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,549
question right wasn't on the microphone

898
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:42,990
coming what's the questions are captured

899
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,700
yeah yeah so tor that's a that's a

900
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:48,270
really good question because a lot of no

901
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,970
script users are involuntary no script

902
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,280
users because they're using tor we

903
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,529
started the whole process by actually

904
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,690
interviewing people on the tour design

905
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:02,190
team shout out to the tour design team

906
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:04,350
awesome work by the way yes exactly so

907
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,430
we interviewed them and we you know

908
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:09,089
talked about some of the issues that

909
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:11,220
might come up there is a whole project

910
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,830
that is integrating no script into tor

911
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,870
and they're actually thinking about not

912
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:18,090
showcasing any of the UI at all which i

913
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:21,029
think is a totally reasonable

914
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,430
you know solution to the thing you're

915
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,140
going into the back the background

916
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,200
setting isn't changing and you know very

917
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,540
detailed things maybe things are going

918
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,850
to be different depending on the new UI

919
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,640
and how its implemented but yeah that's

920
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,620
gonna be a real project in general you

921
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,000
actually you absolutely should have find

922
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,680
out what other tools fit in people's

923
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,780
workflow right you want to ask people

924
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,490
what browser they are using you want to

925
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,500
find out what OS they are using and if

926
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:50,430
you find that it's like there's a huge

927
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,950
chunk of people who use who use Chrome

928
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,450
then you need to take that into a

929
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,859
how it interacts with the other chrome

930
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,149
extensions they're likely to use it with

931
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,570
I would absolutely work that into a

932
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:03,260
persona all right then let's just

933
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:08,550
continue with a question from the front

934
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:13,020
so this is a technical question in the

935
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:15,180
UI and I saw allow affiliated sites

936
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,460
button how does that work without any

937
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:21,990
lists because for example the aesthetic

938
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:24,030
a1 dot New York Times isn't really

939
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:26,700
connected to the New York Times domain

940
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,500
how does that work yes that's a it's a

941
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,770
good question nice catch

942
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,600
so what we're gonna do is by default

943
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,220
affiliated scripts our first party

944
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,810
scripts so those things that you can

945
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,419
definitely read based on the domain and

946
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,040
for the other ones you can't do it you

947
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,610
know automatically so what we're gonna

948
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,710
do is most likely offer some background

949
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,960
so when you install the next no script

950
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,300
it's going to have the affiliated

951
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,310
scripts of the ten most visited sites so

952
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:57,360
that people have like less breakage on

953
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:59,430
very basic browsing experiences and for

954
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,340
the rest of them what we're what we have

955
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,960
imagined is actually people have being

956
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,170
able to import and export their own

957
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,700
settings a lot so when you actually do

958
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,020
want to mark something as an affiliated

959
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,180
script you can share that with a wider

960
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,070
community of people right so there is

961
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,200
that feature built in but the rest of it

962
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,780
is all by hand as we said you know no

963
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,759
script is not a smart tool it just does

964
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:25,140
what you tell it to do and it does it

965
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,100
reliably yeah it was also interested

966
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,650
what site-specific actually means

967
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:35,360
probably is it the same it's yeah

968
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:37,980
related to subdomains and fun right so

969
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,170
subdomains of the site you mean or okay

970
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:43,110
because I think there's also another

971
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:45,600
question about the site's specific

972
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,190
scripts that are blocked or not blocked

973
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,470
right so another way of looking at

974
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,120
affiliated scripts is also these are

975
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,560
this is the kind of profile of scripts

976
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,380
that I want to allow allow or block

977
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,029
whenever I visit a site so that's a

978
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:03,180
that's kind of a different but related

979
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:04,970
feature so another question and you

980
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,899
actually had it on

981
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:11,149
on the list of related projects you

982
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,080
matrix I think it actually fits and I

983
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:17,570
kinda similar niche as no strip does and

984
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,880
have you evaluated like how their user

985
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,920
interfaces I mean it's probably the

986
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,670
matrix of a thousand switches that you

987
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,510
were mentioning but to me it's it's

988
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,920
actually the one I use and have you

989
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,470
checked how you could integrate maybe

990
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,670
something like that into no script yes

991
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,098
you're absolutely right I think the

992
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,560
matrix is what got me thinking about the

993
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,359
matrix to begin with right like the the

994
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,270
the eight and options I was mentioning

995
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,779
before it is super interesting there are

996
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:49,880
totally similar extensions I think no

997
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,950
script does a couple more things than

998
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,150
you matrix but in general they're the

999
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:58,939
same category of script blockers to me

1000
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,730
the the takeaway for me was that so I

1001
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,890
our job wasn't to evaluate you matrix

1002
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,660
but to me that takeaway was that was

1003
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:09,580
actually a little bit too fine-grained

1004
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,580
for most people even for power users

1005
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:17,598
sorry I was very unspecific with messing

1006
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:21,379
with my question I meant the new feature

1007
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:25,099
that you added to save for the site or

1008
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:27,980
what you called it first site settings

1009
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:34,040
yeah what it actually means in terms of

1010
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:35,630
a URL I said is it like a top-level

1011
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,839
domain sub level domain or is it like

1012
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:41,510
the the full path of the URL I think

1013
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,119
right now it's a full path of the URL so

1014
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:48,320
whenever I am on facebook.com or any sub

1015
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:50,420
domain of facebook.com things are going

1016
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,730
to implement it yes so yes for

1017
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,560
subdomains but these are things that

1018
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:57,170
probably like some of the default

1019
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,799
options were gonna like leave up to

1020
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,180
Giorgio's to make the decision on that

1021
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,160
but the idea that so the funny story

1022
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,009
behind that if I if I can comment on

1023
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,930
this is this whole feature is supported

1024
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,910
by the backend and has been for a long

1025
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,710
time and the only reason it wasn't

1026
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,660
implemented was because giorgo couldn't

1027
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,490
figure out what the UI should look like

1028
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,649
given how complicated everything else

1029
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,970
already is

1030
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,170
so this is something we were really

1031
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:24,430
excited that we were able to implement

1032
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:29,049
okay I think if we hurry up we have time

1033
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:31,538
for one more question in the back yeah I

1034
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:33,670
was you mentioned the color and I was

1035
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:36,249
wondering and of course there are

1036
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,960
colorblind people that have a

1037
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:39,879
disadvantage if you use color for your

1038
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,769
design but then there's a whole bunch of

1039
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,049
people that greatly benefits from colors

1040
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:47,709
and I was wondering if you have some

1041
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:49,720
sort of rule of thumb that you use for

1042
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,670
example I don't use colors at all it's

1043
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,618
probably not what it is but maybe

1044
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:58,509
there's something like if I use colors I

1045
00:44:53,619 --> 00:45:01,150
also use two X or Y you always want to

1046
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:03,369
be showing necessary information with

1047
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,099
color and one other dimension that can

1048
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:08,710
be like positioning that can be words

1049
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:10,509
that can be icons you just need to make

1050
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,069
sure that they're the color is not doing

1051
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:14,289
all of the weight you don't want for

1052
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:16,509
example to click on a red circle or

1053
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:19,180
click on a green circle because people

1054
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:21,369
don't have the like in in real life we

1055
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,200
know that in a traffic light if the top

1056
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:24,670
thing is lit up it's probably red if the

1057
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,169
bottom thing it's probably green the

1058
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,190
interface is new they've not seen it

1059
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,569
before they don't know that the left

1060
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,039
thing is gonna be okay and the right

1061
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:30,640
thing is gonna be canceled or the other

1062
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,960
way around

1063
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,629
oh my god apps are always switching

1064
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,359
we're okay as versus cancel where yes is

1065
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:39,160
versus no so just color is great do use

1066
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,960
color and usually green for yes red for

1067
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,759
no that didn't quite work in no script

1068
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,859
because the yes and the no the bad and

1069
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:47,319
the good the good and evil the trust and

1070
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:49,808
trust and block like that just didn't it

1071
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:52,690
didn't match up so we actually didn't

1072
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:53,950
use this red-green pairing anywhere you

1073
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,569
should feel free to use red-green

1074
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,848
pairings only when you're sure it makes

1075
00:45:55,569 --> 00:46:02,200
sense and always use also text or an

1076
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:04,930
icon all right that concludes the talk

1077
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,879
so things again a bunch Eileen and Molly

1078
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,680
for the super interesting talk and I'm

1079
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,230
sure a bunch of people are gonna give no

1080
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,690
script another try it once they see the

1081
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:22,959
new UI Thanks

1082
