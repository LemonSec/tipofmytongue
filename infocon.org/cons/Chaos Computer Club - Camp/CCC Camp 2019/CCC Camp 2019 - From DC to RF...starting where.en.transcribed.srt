[Music]

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,550
for today is going to be about PCB

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,320
design for RF circuits annex presenter

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,910
is going to be Chris Gamal please

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,910
welcome him with a big round of applause

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,690
all right thanks for coming today so

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,330
let's talk about some goals to start

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,519
with just going to talk about how I got

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,530
into the world of working with RF I'm

10
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:46,690
gonna try not to bury you with math I

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,650
know that it's a hot summer day and the

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,989
last thing you want to do is look at

13
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,970
math equations and then finally the main

14
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:55,030
thing is to get you some resources as

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,140
well so you can do what I did and make

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,409
the mistakes I've made hopefully a

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:03,309
couple fewer so let's talk about you who

18
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:04,360
here has Electronics experience okay

19
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:08,229
that's a good crowd

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,380
how about RF experience a couple fewer a

21
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:14,950
couple maybes any ham radio operators

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,850
out there okay and then the main thing

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,160
is you might have some more experience

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,960
than I do so that's kind of the main

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,250
thing I was getting at here is that I

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,500
want to talk about the struggles that

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,790
I've had as I've moved from DC to RF

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,290
that was kind of the genesis for this

29
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,330
talk and show you what I've been doing

30
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,010
and show you some mistakes I made and

31
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,800
hopefully you make fewer mistakes than I

32
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,140
did so first off who am i my name is

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,420
Chris I've been doing electronics design

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,260
for 15 years or so and I've worked in a

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,880
bunch of different industry

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,620
semiconductor and industrial and stuff

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,850
like that and I really like the

38
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,560
industrial side of things you get to

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,899
really dig into problems and you don't

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,130
have the six-month cycle that consumer

41
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,200
does although there's a lot of fun

42
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,110
problems there too as to host a show

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,070
called the amp power electronics podcast

44
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,800
been doing that for about nine years now

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,360
and I teach people electronics obviously

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
teach people the DC side of electronics

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,620
I'm not teaching them RF because I'm

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,060
learning RF and that's called contextual

49
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,800
Ektron ik so that's an online course

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,209
where I teach people how to do some of

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,010
this stuff and my past though I started

52
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:16,690
by work on this anyone know who that

53
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,269
what this is raise your hand if you know

54
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,010
what this is it's a electrometer so this

55
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,359
is used by material scientists basically

56
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,500
you push a thousand volts into a

57
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,700
material and then you

58
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,530
much leakage currents coming through it

59
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,089
they can do down to like sometimes it's

60
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,280
a really cool thing but the thing is

61
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,770
it's really slow like it's really slow

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,000
ten PLC's power line cycles means you're

63
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,850
getting about six readings per second

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,500
and inside you're basically you're

65
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,430
integrating everything you're by

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
integrating I mean you're integrating

67
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,700
your measurements over and over again

68
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,040
and your things are just going really

69
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,170
slow it's truly a DC measurement

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,910
equipment so not quite blazing of course

71
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,070
there are microcontrollers in there

72
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,680
there are you know some higher speed

73
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,000
signal things but my focus when I get

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
starting electronics this is my first

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,810
real electronics job was doing this kind

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,420
of thing it's so learning a lot of the

77
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,250
DC measurement techniques over time it's

78
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,570
also morphed into working with sensors

79
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,220
and other you know power supplies

80
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,019
obviously everything is a switching

81
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,280
regulator these days but we're not

82
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,890
talking about blazing speeds here we're

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,340
definitely not talking about RF you know

84
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,958
level frequencies so what really changed

85
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,520
here and what changed is the world

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,989
around us and you've probably all

87
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,760
noticed this too right and we're all

88
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,520
wearing wristbands right now that have

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,769
bluetooth on it it's everywhere every

90
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,820
every product basically throws in a

91
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,790
bluetooth chipset

92
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,049
for for effectively free or you know it

93
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,570
has some kind of connectivity method

94
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,640
because that's a feature and that means

95
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,430
that every product is gonna have RF in

96
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,929
its RF send everything of course RF is

97
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,760
actually everywhere as well right we're

98
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,640
always surrounded by signals but every

99
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,320
product has it as well and it's super

100
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,458
cheap these days and so this is a chip

101
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,600
I've been talking about lately this is

102
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,170
like a little for two in the 33

103
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,280
megahertz transmitter and it's 15 cents

104
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,018
if you buy a hundred of them I mean like

105
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,519
these are levels of cheapness that are

106
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,010
like it's just you could throw it in

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,590
anything and so this was starting to

108
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,578
motivate me and I assume that that's why

109
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,230
you're sitting here as well we're

110
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,940
watching online you're a little bit

111
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,709
motivated as well by some of the stuff

112
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,269
and you don't you want to know what to

113
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,130
do with it so you're interested in

114
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,560
making things you're interested in this

115
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,970
cheap wonderful hardware and you're

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,010
wondering how to actually integrate it

117
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,780
so let me tell you about my story about

118
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:25,120
how I started with my first RF design so

119
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,799
the first thing I did was the most

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,500
obvious thing which was to copy the app

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,210
note and if you're talking electronics

122
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,000
designers that's a very common thing

123
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,409
it's it's not you know I when I started

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,610
my career I was always kind of worried

125
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,190
about it like oh I'm just copying I'm

126
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,710
not doing anything

127
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,210
original but so much of electronics

128
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,530
these days is just reimplemented what's

129
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,909
there because you're in a rush or you

130
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,219
you know your work that you losing

131
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,630
what's working and even if you put

132
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,400
everything in exactly the same there's

133
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,960
still gonna be problems and I always say

134
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,120
that electronics designers you know they

135
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,710
they make their payday by making things

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,070
work even when they're supposed to be

137
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,930
working so I mean I always guess about

138
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,370
80% or so of a circuit design might be

139
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,440
you know it's reference design you're

140
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,060
copying a switching regulator you're

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,730
using a microcontroller and you're

142
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,780
copying the the stuff there as well and

143
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,480
you're just trying to get it to work and

144
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,369
so that's the first thing I did and

145
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,390
there's a great talk as well by Mike

146
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,400
Osmond who was here at this conference

147
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,349
he talks about this was well this is a

148
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,020
talk he gave back at 2015 with some

149
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,870
rules about how to basically you know

150
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,130
copy RF circuit and go through this so I

151
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,020
kind of think about my talk as an

152
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,150
extension of that talk some of his rules

153
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,859
were using four layers using integrated

154
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,810
components trying to get everything as

155
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,040
50 ohms following the manufacturer

156
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,490
recommendations that's effectively

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,750
copying the example circuits and then

158
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,110
routing RF first I think these are all

159
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,480
really good good rules here and I I did

160
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,520
a lot of these and and so let's talk

161
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,220
about my first design so my first design

162
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,549
was a a cellular module I was working on

163
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,020
for a previous employer and I had a

164
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,740
little microcontroller had a sim card on

165
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,000
it and it worked right so not much of a

166
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,950
story there it just kind of worked but

167
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,120
why did it work that's kind of them the

168
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,550
main thing we're trying to get at here

169
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,700
why did this just work out of the box

170
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,230
and with simplicity that I was applying

171
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,090
to it you know I applied those five

172
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,610
rules that Mike was talking about but

173
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,099
the main things to know are the module

174
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,540
onboard it was it was pre matched with

175
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,340
the antenna as well that was plugging it

176
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,430
effectively the RF section that I was

177
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,429
using was connecting the output of the

178
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,600
cellular module modem to a UFL antenna

179
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,830
connector and then I was using an

180
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,630
antenna that was already pre characters

181
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,430
writers as well so I had a very very

182
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,980
short distance where I was connecting

183
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,140
the output to a port where I was gonna

184
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,270
plug an antenna into I basically

185
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,490
minimized my interaction I kept my RF

186
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,630
trace short and I didn't really worry

187
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,880
about it past that because this was just

188
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,520
a test board but it worked enough for me

189
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,680
to be excited about it you know kind of

190
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,549
keep trying and you need those dopamine

191
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,110
scores to kind of keep going

192
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,479
so can we do this all the time right can

193
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,220
we always just keep keeping traces

194
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
really short can we just copy the data

195
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,610
sheet can we follow those five rules and

196
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,020
the answer is yeah maybe I mean you

197
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,530
might be able to you might be able to

198
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,729
just integrate components like that but

199
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,650
it really depends on your design goals

200
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,000
it depends on what your you're trying to

201
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,500
get out of it it's trying depends on

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,990
what you're trying to do with your end

203
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,789
product when you're starting to move

204
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,409
into a more uncharacterized zone right

205
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,150
say you're making a PCB ntek you want to

206
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:20,069
make your own PCB antenna where the

207
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,090
antenna is built into the board that's

208
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,110
gonna be a little bit harder right

209
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,698
you're gonna need to do a little bit

210
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,490
more characterization and testing if

211
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,810
you're going from a differential to a

212
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,430
single end it you might have to do some

213
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,039
more stuff there and and do a bunch more

214
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,330
math and use more components but it's

215
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,000
really the complexity of your circuit

216
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,130
that's gonna have the the most impact on

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,370
your your success in in that realm if

218
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,659
you're just trying to do that that stuff

219
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,460
let's talk about though why I wanted to

220
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,280
learn more about this in the first place

221
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,378
the first one is I'm a consultant I do

222
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,000
designs for people and the thing that

223
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,129
kept me up at night is I was going to

224
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,569
just you know copy the datasheet do this

225
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,460
thing but then I'm gonna get it to the

226
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:57,750
bench and it doesn't work and there's

227
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,370
nothing scarier than the thought of like

228
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,659
being there and just trying to like you

229
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,849
know you hold your finger here and you

230
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,990
hope that it works and you know you open

231
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,340
the window and hope that changes

232
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,080
something and you don't know what you're

233
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,029
doing you're basically cargo cult kind

234
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,229
of trying to impact your environment

235
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,909
without actually having any control over

236
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:13,880
it and that was a big fear for me I

237
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,210
didn't want to be in that situation

238
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,529
that's doubly true when I'm sitting at a

239
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,659
compliance test lab and they're charging

240
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:22,770
ten thousand dollars a day and I still

241
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,180
don't know what I'm doing so they I

242
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,430
wanted to basically be able to

243
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,949
understand the underlying because that

244
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,620
could really impact the ability to get a

245
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,000
product out into the world and finally

246
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,979
is kind of a feel-good one as well

247
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,370
I want to make sure obviously FCC and

248
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,240
seee compliance these are things that

249
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,380
they're testing the same thing that

250
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,760
you're not stomping on someone else's

251
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,189
bandwidth or you know you're not

252
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,180
operating out of range but that's also

253
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,709
something I don't want to do I don't

254
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,870
want to you know mess up someone else's

255
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:52,949
day because I've got a poorly designed

256
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,750
circuit so a lot of people said that

257
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,950
they had RF experience in their prowl

258
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,000
which is great but I'm gonna assume that

259
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,649
everybody does so we're gonna goes

260
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,570
through through some of the RF concepts

261
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:01,920
that are kind of tricky and stuff that

262
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,380
still kind of trips me up a little bit

263
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,780
as well

264
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,100
first off is the frequency domain right

265
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,020
so this is a lot of the things we talk

266
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,520
about when we're talking about RF and

267
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,650
higher frequency things we start moving

268
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,030
from a time time domain to a frequency

269
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,860
domain and this is a topic that I think

270
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,540
there's a lot of math behind it but I

271
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,130
promise you not to get too much into it

272
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,410
so some of you're gonna have to take on

273
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,810
faith I'm gonna show you as this is a

274
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,579
scope trace so this is a the top one is

275
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,890
a square wave you might have this as

276
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,340
like a clock or a similar on-off signal

277
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,600
so you're blinking an LED on and off

278
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,130
what you have there though is you have

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,390
different frequency components that

280
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:43,070
actually exist within that and so the

281
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,560
bottom the bottom part is the actual

282
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,030
frequency component of that square wave

283
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,500
now that doesn't really mean much and

284
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,510
it's really tough when you come you know

285
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,310
you look at them side by side right they

286
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:56,000
look like they're on the same axis but

287
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,260
they're actually not right so take that

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,240
a little bit on faith but I also found a

289
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,700
great animation and will hope that this

290
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,960
plays it looks like it's going to I love

291
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,360
this because it's basically showing you

292
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,950
the the components is it playing yes

293
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,660
plane so it's showing you the components

294
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,820
that actually exist and make up

295
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,079
they basically sum up and make a square

296
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,090
wave right so this is a simplified

297
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,500
version they make up this square wave

298
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,600
and they exist in these different

299
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,020
amounts right so the the largest sine

300
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,430
wave is is the most it's the that's the

301
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,210
main frequency that exists within it but

302
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,620
then there's all these smaller

303
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,300
frequencies as well and you see how that

304
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,430
kind of translated to be between the

305
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,479
time domain and the frequency domain we

306
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,489
could basically if we have this

307
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,560
information we can then go and perfectly

308
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,300
replicate that same square wave by

309
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,650
knowing the frequency information so

310
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,819
this is kind of a tough concept to get

311
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,439
your head around but it is one that will

312
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,610
be very very useful and I'll talk a

313
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,900
little bit more about an instrument that

314
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,120
kind of helps you to visualize this as

315
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,480
well I think that went through a full

316
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,130
cycle another tricky topic is just kind

317
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,740
of components right we're trying to

318
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,930
squeeze a lot of electronics into into a

319
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:58,310
45-minute talk here but capacitors

320
00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:00,170
basically when you're when you're at a

321
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,520
when you're at DC they're blocking

322
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,810
everything right there's no signal

323
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,400
that's going to be going through as you

324
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,810
go up in frequency the signal is going

325
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,720
to basically be able to pass through the

326
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,979
the capacitor again it's not physically

327
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,450
passing through but it's effectively

328
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,950
passing through and this is a really

329
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,750
tough concept to get but the the main

330
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,579
thing to know is that the the transition

331
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,350
between blocking and not block

332
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,149
happens because of the the value of the

333
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,879
capacitor itself by the capacitance of

334
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:25,489
that component in the inverse way the an

335
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,339
inductor allows frequencies to pass

336
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:30,559
through at a the low frequency or DC and

337
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,749
it blocks it at a higher frequency as

338
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,459
you move up in the RF world and so these

339
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:36,499
two things kind of play off on another

340
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,609
and they interact again this is a lot of

341
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,989
electronics theory trying to squeeze

342
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,929
into a small talk but hopefully you'll

343
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,429
take some of it on faith another thing

344
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,220
is that in RF a lot of times we're

345
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,439
working in log scales right so you'll

346
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,069
see a lot of decibels or DB and DBM

347
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:55,759
which is amour DB is ratio metric and

348
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:57,709
DBM is more an actual value and but the

349
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,059
idea is here that we're operating in

350
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,349
orders of magnitude and that's really

351
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,110
important you'll see an example a little

352
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,360
bit later here so you'll see a lot of

353
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,799
things referred to in DB and that can

354
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,660
again be kind of hard to wrap your head

355
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,149
around but it's a it's an important

356
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,429
concept because the scale that we're

357
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,569
working with of signals when you

358
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:16,129
transmit a signal when you receive a

359
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:18,079
signal it's very very different in terms

360
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:20,149
of the magnitudes that you that you have

361
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,099
there as an added bonus though you

362
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,689
basically when you're going through a

363
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,790
system you have different gains going

364
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:28,699
through right if you have a 10x gain in

365
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,959
something you have a 20 DB addition to

366
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,969
it right so if you're starting at a zero

367
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,679
power signal and you go through a 10x

368
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,959
stage you'll have now 20 DB you put it

369
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,850
through another 10x stage now it's 20 20

370
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,829
DB plus 20 DB now you have a 40 DB

371
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,329
signal at the output and so that's kind

372
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,368
of nice because it does simplify some of

373
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:48,738
the math once you get past the confusion

374
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:50,029
thing Oh wrong way where to go and

375
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:52,730
that's the last thing about this is the

376
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,860
the power is how we're offering may be

377
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,149
talking about RF circuits is it's not

378
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,499
just current it's not just vultures

379
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,389
those obviously make up power together

380
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,369
but we're gonna be usually talking about

381
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,449
power and so that's an important thing

382
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:06,379
to know as well when we're looking at RF

383
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:09,019
subsystems what we're usually talking

384
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:12,049
about is not degrading the signal right

385
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,360
so if we have gain and that's something

386
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,860
that we want to maintain over time we

387
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,899
want to make sure that the signal is not

388
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,889
being interfered with by the things that

389
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,399
we introduced to it so if we have a

390
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,720
connector that has -3 DB of gain that

391
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,249
means that we're making the signal worse

392
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,240
on the other side of that connector and

393
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,829
that's bad we want to make sure we're

394
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,820
not doing that similar if we need to

395
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:31,650
have a output and in

396
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,210
that are not well matched together and

397
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,650
we'll get to that here in a second that

398
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,840
also is going to degrade some of the

399
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,189
signal quality as well so let's talk

400
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,080
about what that signal path looks like

401
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,280
here so on the left side here we have a

402
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,960
tee action we have a radio it's

403
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,760
transmitting that's TX going through a

404
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,780
cable going through an antenna and yes

405
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,160
there is a little bit of gain in the

406
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,540
antenna as well but you see in the

407
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,280
middle here there's that red sloping

408
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,250
line that's basically as it's floating

409
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,579
through the air and going from a cc or

410
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,170
CC Camp cell tower to your your crazy

411
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,090
camp phone you know there's actually

412
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,800
some loss on that and then again the

413
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,360
hits the antenna on your phone there's

414
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,339
some gain there and then there's a cable

415
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,440
and then it's at the receiver all of

416
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,650
these things basically say that you're

417
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,940
gonna be either adding or removing

418
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,800
signal by going through these different

419
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,200
stages and the main thing is we want to

420
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,689
make sure that we're not adding any

421
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,130
degradation or noise as we're going

422
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:26,730
through our systems just back to that

423
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,320
the logarithmic side of things so again

424
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,270
to give you the scale difference here so

425
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,490
if you have a link budget that's 100 DB

426
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,780
and you that means you have a Cygnus if

427
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,520
what you do is you divide that by 20

428
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,199
there's a 5 there you take that 10 to

429
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,760
the fifth I know that's math again but

430
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,680
basically you have a signal that's out

431
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,140
put it if we have one watt signal output

432
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,420
at a transmitter that means we would be

433
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,939
receiving one one hundred thousandth of

434
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,770
that at the phone in this example that I

435
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,450
gave and so that's kind of like why we

436
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,280
want to not introduce any other

437
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,990
degradation than that because it's gonna

438
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,689
make it less likely that we receive that

439
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:02,040
signal at our phone how do we get

440
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,650
through this so so again how do we make

441
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,760
sure we don't degrade unnecessarily well

442
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,069
what we do is we make sure that we're

443
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,200
we're matching the impedance of these

444
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,180
inputs and outputs so that we don't

445
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,310
introduce signal degradation now this is

446
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,290
a new concept when I was moving from DC

447
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,469
to RF that now it's obviously there it

448
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,930
exists at lower frequencies as well but

449
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,550
we want to basically it's much more

450
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,250
critical I think at RF because you are

451
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,949
playing with much different impedances

452
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,410
as well now one of the baseline things

453
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,450
is that you need to have perfectly

454
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,630
matched impedances input and output

455
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:39,630
right so your output might be a

456
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,130
an amplifier your input might be a an

457
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,689
antenna you want to make sure those

458
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,010
things are as perfectly matched as you

459
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,950
can so you're not introducing

460
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,270
unnecessary degradation so let's talk

461
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,580
about a counter example this is would be

462
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,319
a bad situation that you'd have here so

463
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,360
you have an ESP 32 it's a little tiny

464
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,700
Wi-Fi module and then you have a PCB 2

465
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,030
antenna on board and those two things

466
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,200
are not well matched together when

467
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,030
they're not well matched together what's

468
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,410
gonna happen well first off it might not

469
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,050
work at all or you may perceive it not

470
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,270
to work at all because you have a Wi-Fi

471
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,060
router over here you have your ESP 32

472
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,410
over here and it's not actually talking

473
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,030
your Wi-Fi router because there's no

474
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,890
signal getting from one to the other so

475
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,880
without actually having measurement

476
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,280
equipment you won't actually know what's

477
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,439
happening but to your perception is not

478
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,900
going to work another thing though is it

479
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,250
may work but it may not work as long as

480
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,569
far as you want it to right so you it

481
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:33,300
only works with it with your within a

482
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:35,040
foot or within a meter sorry and it's

483
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,709
only gonna sew it and you expect it to

484
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,819
work at 10 meters instead of 1 meter and

485
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,140
then finally you're gonna have a less

486
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,580
efficient system as well right you're

487
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,590
gonna have energy that gets either

488
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,360
radiated locally on your board and not

489
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:50,040
radiated towards your Wi-Fi router or

490
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,480
it's just gonna be dissipated as heat so

491
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,949
what is impedance though right so I know

492
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,390
I'm jumping around topics allotted here

493
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,910
but what we're trying to do is we're

494
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,650
trying to get an output like an antenna

495
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,030
or sorry not put like an amplifier an

496
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,370
input like an antenna these two things

497
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,139
to be kind of talking to one another

498
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,579
and we want them to do that by matching

499
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,970
the repeaters what is impedance so

500
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:12,060
impedance is basically the how it let's

501
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,650
how passes or blocks electromagnetic

502
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,250
energy at various frequencies right so

503
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,350
if we have a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi thing

504
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,099
like the ESP we want to know that our

505
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:27,780
antenna is accepting that energy at that

506
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:30,000
frequency the same as our our amplifier

507
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,450
is outputting that energy at 2.4

508
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,530
gigahertz you may be thinking well why

509
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,120
do we have to do this at all though why

510
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,770
do the Troodon antenna just work

511
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,600
shouldn't all this stuff just work and

512
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,300
the answer is yeah it should just work

513
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,000
but that's not how the world works there

514
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,909
world's imperfect right you may remember

515
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,920
the iPhone iPhone 4 it it was a

516
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,840
well-designed phone I think was the for

517
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,220
but it was a well-designed for phone and

518
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,649
when you held it in your hand though

519
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,970
your hand basically interfered with the

520
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,410
antenna it was changing the impedance of

521
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,880
that antenna and so the matchen was all

522
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,440
messed up and you didn't get the same

523
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,940
kind of distance to the tower as you

524
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,140
thought you would this is a similar kind

525
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,170
of problem obviously in a much larger

526
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,180
scale so it's not just a hand it could

527
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,300
also be you know are there you know is

528
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,560
it a more humid day is there other stuff

529
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,240
in your environment is there a tree

530
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,800
blocking is there other things that are

531
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,760
you in a city are you in the woods you

532
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,330
know all of these things can basically

533
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,760
impact your signal path and also on a

534
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,460
much closer scale how your antenna

535
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,600
actually works so even though you may

536
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,190
have an antenna that comes out of the

537
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,169
box that says yes this is definitely 50

538
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:34,440
ohms you're good to go

539
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,030
there's manufacturing the manufacturing

540
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,160
variability as well and you basically

541
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,990
you want to be able to not only measure

542
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,340
what's happening but also then go and

543
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,130
modify it so that they're well matched

544
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,100
up with one another so it was any simple

545
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,450
example a pine network is one way to

546
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,030
normalize your output and your input in

547
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,860
this case a hundred thousand ohm source

548
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,960
which is on the left here and then you

549
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,610
have your networks of inductors and

550
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,800
capacitors and then your load in this

551
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,179
case would be an antenna at hundred ohms

552
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,250
you want to normalize these things at

553
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,280
fifty megahertz and a bandwidth of six

554
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,420
megahertz basically there's a bunch of

555
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,710
calculations you can do again we're

556
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,850
skipping math but a bunch of

557
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,280
calculations you could do and you can

558
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:14,010
find values that allow you to match up

559
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,720
your your your signal source in this

560
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,060
case an amplifier and your antenna and

561
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,920
they work better together is going to

562
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,990
have the maximum output as you can have

563
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,280
here let's talk about some of the

564
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,690
measurement tools that would get it to

565
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,850
this point and understand this in the

566
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,110
first place right so I had mentioned

567
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,270
this a little bit but a spectrum

568
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,219
analyzer this was again that animation

569
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,770
showing going from a time domain to a

570
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,750
frequency domain so a spectrum analyzer

571
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,560
just basically measures the frequency

572
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,640
domain right so you put in a signal into

573
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,730
your spectrum analyzer you're going to

574
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,050
see a chart of the frequencies and this

575
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,460
is really really useful as you start to

576
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,780
look at something like Bluetooth where

577
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,430
it's hopping over all these different

578
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,899
frequencies and stuff like that but

579
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,210
really anything that's outputting its

580
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,670
own signal right of a phone is going to

581
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,990
generate its own signal a you know again

582
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,960
a Wi-Fi chip is going to generate its

583
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,180
own signal you

584
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,680
then could take that signal and then

585
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,690
look at what it's actually outputting in

586
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,700
in the spectrum and look at it on a

587
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,440
spectrum analyzer you could also do that

588
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,760
what we were looking at earlier I was a

589
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,680
slightly different thing that was an

590
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,780
oscilloscope so that's showing the time

591
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,130
domain and then it has an FFT which is a

592
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,590
measure of the frequency and it's

593
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,440
basically a very tiny software version

594
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:23,080
of what we're looking at here another

595
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,210
thing we can get is a VNA so a vector

596
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,010
network analyzer is something now where

597
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,600
you're not just so the phone might be

598
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,640
outputting a signal on its own right

599
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,090
it's got a battery it's pumping out RF

600
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,530
energy but if you don't have a thing

601
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,330
that's actually actively outputting

602
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,560
energy and you want to measure it you

603
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,210
want to measure the characterization of

604
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
an antenna by itself you might want

605
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,600
something like a VNA and this is where

606
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,310
these things get really really useful so

607
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,330
I've pulled in some of these low cost

608
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:51,399
DNA's here and low cost is very relative

609
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:54,370
on the top left there is that many time

610
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,590
mini VNA tiniest 400 euro top right is

611
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,850
pocket VNA tiny 4 out of Euro and these

612
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,470
are like some of the bottom of the line

613
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,560
not the lowest but pretty pretty low

614
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,610
then the deep ace is the bottom left

615
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,690
that's at 2 K HP 8753 a starts at 2 K

616
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,889
and kind of goes up with depending what

617
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,620
you have in there and you're like wow

618
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,610
that's really expensive but you know

619
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,840
I've been shopping around for all these

620
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,550
things I've been on eBay and I've been

621
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,709
looking all these different things and I

622
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,649
was really shocked to see a VNA that was

623
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,000
about 550 heroes I saw it and I'm so

624
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,990
excited about it and I was like wow this

625
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,670
thing looks beautiful

626
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,200
definitely a bid on it and then I

627
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,090
realized that I actually was looking at

628
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,640
the wrong thing this was five hundred

629
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:34,659
fifty thousand dollars so if I could

630
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,070
borrow some money from people in the

631
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,050
audience we could definitely go in

632
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,070
together on this thing but what this

633
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,389
really what are the reason I'm putting

634
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,980
this up on here is to show kind of a

635
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,140
scale difference right you can go from a

636
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,550
400 euro dollar thing all the way up to

637
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,100
a five hundred sixty thousand dollar

638
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,470
thing and the thing that you're paying

639
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,850
for between the two is the one that the

640
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,520
four hundred euro thing is gonna work

641
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,590
more in the you know two hundred that

642
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,010
one Giga 200 Hertz the one gigahertz

643
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,689
range this is showing it a 67 gigahertz

644
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,250
range it's super super complicated all

645
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,690
of the things that happen in between all

646
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,550
of the losses that I've already talked

647
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,320
about basically everything has to be

648
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,330
perfect in this machine and I think it's

649
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,889
a good example of showing like kind of

650
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,760
the scale of what has to happen and what

651
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,470
you're really paying for

652
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,629
when you buy a VNA is the frequency

653
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,490
range right it'll scale pretty linearly

654
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,780
as you move up in frequency range your

655
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,780
price is going to move up as well so

656
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,510
personally I'm targeting things a little

657
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,130
bit lower I want to do things that are

658
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,140
you know commercially available 900

659
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,820
megahertz 2.4 gigahertz maybe 5

660
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,350
gigahertz but those are the ranges that

661
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,790
I want to play with and maybe you want

662
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,050
to play with as well because I want to

663
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,810
play with all the radios that are out

664
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:41,110
there that are cheap and abundant and

665
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,909
and kind of self-contained the last

666
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,350
thing you might need is Cal kit and what

667
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,210
this does is basically it gives you an

668
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,590
open a short and an own load and

669
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,450
basically you can calibrate the

670
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,250
equipment that you have that I showed

671
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,750
right the VNA you can go and calibrate

672
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,170
that thing and that's important not only

673
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,790
because you know it gets warm you're in

674
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,660
a warm tent or you're out in the Sun or

675
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,399
something like that and you're using

676
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,560
your VNA you want to make sure it's it's

677
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,760
it's well calibrate at that point but

678
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,100
you also might have cables in between

679
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,990
you might be have a test setup where you

680
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
have a cable from point A to point B and

681
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,060
you wanna make sure that that cable

682
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,409
isn't part of your measurement and

683
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,659
that's something that a cow kit can help

684
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,820
with as well so let's talk about some

685
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,990
measurements real quick okay I know

686
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,450
we're on a summer day we're talking

687
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,700
about measurements how fun but I think

688
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,470
these are really important Smith charts

689
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,050
are basically a you know it's basically

690
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,720
a collection of measurements in a

691
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,280
visualization tool and so this says

692
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,500
things like impedance and reluctance on

693
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,700
it and I'm gonna be honest here I'm not

694
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,930
using Smith charts all that much but I

695
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,110
didn't want to show it because the VNA's

696
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,400
kind of allow you to have these outputs

697
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,590
right you can go and match things a

698
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,480
little bit easier a lot of the when I

699
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,310
showed the ours were sorry of the season

700
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,450
the inductors and capacitors that had

701
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,159
different values you can go and find

702
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,370
those by using something like a Smith

703
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,090
chart and that's really a powerful thing

704
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,580
VNA's also show you things like

705
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,040
s-parameters Oso return loss insertion

706
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,960
loss power transfer and reflected power

707
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,730
these are all things that basically you

708
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,490
can go and characterize your systems

709
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,890
with so your antenna your output maybe

710
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,320
you have gain stage basically you can

711
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,790
use one or two port Network analyzer to

712
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,649
go and measure these different

713
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,570
parameters and characterize your system

714
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,090
and that's really useful for when things

715
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,120
don't work and again that was one of my

716
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:21,040
one of my big things return loss is a

717
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,989
very common one so this is also known as

718
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,190
a reflection coefficient and basically

719
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,360
this is something you might do when you

720
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,760
might plug in a antenna

721
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,709
here right so this is showing this is

722
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,360
showing an antenna right and it's

723
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,440
showing that it's reflecting power at

724
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,719
most frequencies and there's a little

725
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,290
unintuitive from my perspective it's

726
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,490
when it's flat at the top it's saying

727
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,470
that's where it's reflecting most

728
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,080
frequencies but at 2.4 gigahertz it's

729
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:47,200
actually there's a bunch of power that's

730
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,909
that's not being reflected back and it's

731
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,410
basically showing that it's tuned for

732
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,799
this frequency this is a way to show

733
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:56,620
that this is a well tuned antenna and

734
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,540
how narrow or wide that dip is is also

735
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,209
going to show how selective the

736
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,970
frequencies are this also plays into

737
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,950
VSWR which is the voltage standing wave

738
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,910
ratio this is what a lot of ham radio

739
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,080
people use as well when they're

740
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,929
characterizing antennas that you could

741
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,760
use a little bit more broadly but here's

742
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,130
an attenuator sorry here's a equation

743
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,690
here and you see the gamma that's in

744
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,390
that equation that's that funky-looking

745
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,570
our thing in the equation at the bottom

746
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,330
that is basically the last thing we were

747
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,020
looking at here sorry that is the return

748
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,178
loss and that bent plays in the V wwr

749
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,850
and it's basically helping you figure

750
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:36,640
out how well matched it is so basically

751
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:41,500
as you get a lower and lower VSWR you

752
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,669
have a better antenna okay so that was

753
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,490
kind of the measurement stuff we talked

754
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,080
about some of the basics of RF and now I

755
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,750
wanted to kind of transition into like

756
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,399
the title of the talk we needed that

757
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,340
build up but all that kind of background

758
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,350
information here but the reason I

759
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:59,530
started thinking about all this in this

760
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,750
first place is why does DC end up kind

761
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,830
of change as you move towards RF what

762
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,290
are some of these assumptions that I've

763
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,510
always had as I was doing specifically

764
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,799
layouts and new designs I'm thinking

765
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,559
about how I'm gonna put my different

766
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,559
components together how does it all play

767
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:16,389
together the first one is just that a

768
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,940
wire is just a wire so if I hook up a

769
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,970
component over here at a and I what put

770
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,280
up you know piece of 24 AWG wire over to

771
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,770
be that the signals just gonna get there

772
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,940
and that's obviously not true with DC

773
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,520
either these are all very simplified

774
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,870
versions but it's definitely not true as

775
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,850
you move up in the RF region right

776
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,469
because every wire is actually an

777
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,820
inductor as especially as you move up

778
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,799
into higher frequencies right

779
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,359
comes from the magnetic field that are

780
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,309
happening as you pass current through a

781
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,439
wire you start to formula that form

782
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,570
these magnetic fields here and they

783
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,029
resist is basically the resistance of

784
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,889
the magnetic field as you're moving

785
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:53,330
current through it so as you try and

786
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:54,738
turn off the current the magnetic fields

787
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,029
now going to push back and start to try

788
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,279
and it's gonna spike the voltage

789
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:59,299
effectively and you may recognize the

790
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,950
thing on the right here if you've ever

791
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:02,869
wrapped a piece of wire around a

792
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,769
screwdriver as a kid and you pet attach

793
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,658
it to a battery you make an

794
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:07,220
electromagnet that's you know the same

795
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:08,659
kind of idea here if you look at a lot

796
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,989
of inductors what they look like is

797
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:15,259
coiled wires around some kind of

798
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:16,729
substrate as well and so the main thing

799
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,099
to know is that yeah a wire is not just

800
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:20,599
a wire at DC it doesn't matter because

801
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:23,200
usually the inductance is low enough

802
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,879
that it's not a huge deal and there's a

803
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
pretty practical example here that many

804
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:28,939
people especially getting started in

805
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,220
electronics will understand as you're

806
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,509
using a breadboard and breadboards

807
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,830
usually operate fine

808
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,570
even you know up to ten megahertz

809
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,039
they're operating fine if you're

810
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,149
blinking something at ten mil are

811
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,590
blinking something at ten megahertz you

812
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:43,099
probably not seeing it but say you're

813
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:45,649
operating a clock at a you know a 80

814
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,970
mega 3:28 that works fine at eight

815
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:49,219
megahertz but if you're trying to pump

816
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,629
it many many more megahertz than that

817
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,429
you're gonna start to have degradation

818
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,928
issues and that's because of the

819
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:56,029
inductance as you're starting to wire

820
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:57,320
from one point to another basically not

821
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:58,639
just the wires that they show here but

822
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,859
then the strips of metal that underneath

823
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:04,459
the breadboard as well and that brings

824
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:05,779
us to our next thing which is in DC of

825
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,359
course I never actually thought this

826
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,979
when I was designing stuff in DC but

827
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,109
that PCB construction the stuff that

828
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:14,119
makes a printed circuit board right the

829
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,889
fiberglass and the copper and stuff in

830
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:17,178
there aren't as important as the

831
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:19,219
components that I put on there so the

832
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,899
the resistance of a trace or the

833
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,129
inductance of a trace isn't as important

834
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,869
as the resistor that have put on board

835
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:26,389
there and that is definitely not true as

836
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,279
we move up in frequency right so this is

837
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:30,830
a four layer stack up here right this is

838
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,299
showing how you and I it's a kind of a

839
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,580
side view so it's kind of hard to see

840
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:36,019
here but you basically have four layers

841
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,340
at the top you're gonna run all your

842
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,840
traces and you have your components

843
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,678
actually soldered down on top if you

844
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,820
have been in the hardware hacking

845
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,409
village you can go and see some of the

846
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,239
surface mount stuff they're highly

847
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,369
recommend that but you have traces on

848
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:47,509
the topside inside you might have a you

849
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:49,158
should have a ground layer which is

850
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:50,749
usually the second layer then you have

851
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,320
signal and power on the third layer and

852
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:52,850
then you can

853
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,139
more traces on the bottom and also some

854
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,959
more ground so these are kind of the

855
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,180
normal stack ups here but the stack up

856
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,000
the actual dimensions of that stack up

857
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,580
how far one thing is from another that's

858
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,490
when it really starts to play together

859
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,139
much more at high frequencies than it

860
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,500
does at low frequencies again these

861
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,270
these these characteristics all exist at

862
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,670
low frequencies but you don't have to

863
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,720
worry about them as much and or you care

864
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,850
about them in different ways I suppose

865
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,300
so as you start moving up in frequencies

866
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:25,219
you start to have some more complexities

867
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,899
that kind of kind of get introduced here

868
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,270
so this is pretty much the only math

869
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,270
that we have to do here but this is and

870
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,490
it's in a calculator too so from online

871
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,460
the links are all here but say you have

872
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,050
a trace is 4 mils wide or 0.1 millimeter

873
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,510
the track is about 50 millimeters long

874
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,950
or to about two inches and your height

875
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,350
above ground right so what we're saying

876
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,080
is from the top top layer a layer 1 to

877
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,550
layer 2 I was looking up just a standard

878
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,820
stack up it says about point two

879
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,260
millimeters and so basically put all

880
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,510
these things in there that means that

881
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,540
track has an impedance and inductance

882
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,730
rather of 63 nano Henri's and if we take

883
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,490
that at 2.4 gigahertz that's effectively

884
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,960
a 1 kilo ohm resistor effectively again

885
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,510
this is operating at these different

886
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,710
frequencies but the idea here is that as

887
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,330
that actually is a more significant

888
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,700
amount of impedance than you would have

889
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,530
normally thought from just having a wire

890
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,970
if a wire was just a wire that wouldn't

891
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,030
be a problem right you assumed that it's

892
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:25,070
you know zero ohm the ideal case it is

893
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:27,290
definitely not the ideal case though so

894
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,810
first off is very important to note that

895
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,280
yes your ground plane should always be

896
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,870
the lower the you know right below where

897
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,460
you're running your RF signals that's

898
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,229
very very important you need to define

899
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,910
that as well and you need to pay

900
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,730
attention when you're buying a PCB as

901
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,560
well so this is a stack up from jlc and

902
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,570
this is showing that that point two

903
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,980
millimeters between the top layer the

904
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,419
top layer copper and the next layer down

905
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,460
and that's important to know that not

906
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,560
only that you also need to know the I

907
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,720
think that the calculator I was using it

908
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,070
actually assumed the dielectric but

909
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,870
basically you're you're setting up these

910
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,520
two physical things in the real world

911
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,620
and you need to understand how those

912
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,450
things play with one another again you

913
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,040
needed to care about that at DC but you

914
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,800
really need to care about it as you're

915
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,139
moving up in freak

916
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,280
see for RF circuits and not even just RF

917
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,840
circuses you doing high-speed digital

918
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,370
you're also have to worry about it there

919
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,929
with controlled and peanuts and things

920
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,850
like that okay another assumption not

921
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,190
again a very simplistic assumption for

922
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:23,310
DC is that a capacitor is there to store

923
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,800
charge and yes that is true but the idea

924
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,340
here is that a capacitor isn't just a

925
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,350
capacitor right and so these are a

926
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,610
smorgasbord of different capacitors up

927
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,800
on the top left the top left is

928
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,479
through-hole capacitors and the top

929
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,040
right is surface mount capacitors the

930
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,660
top left when you have through-hole

931
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,920
capacitors they actually have wires

932
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,210
literally attached to them that is what

933
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,080
those leads are and again we've already

934
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,610
talked about this

935
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,590
those are act those are inductors

936
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,699
effectively the same thing happens

937
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,770
though at low frequency you can never

938
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,470
really get rid of that inductor and that

939
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,490
we have below there is the equivalent

940
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,920
series of duct tends to equivalent

941
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,510
series resistance parallel resistance

942
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,330
and then the actual capacitance itself

943
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:02,400
this is kind of a both model of what a

944
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:05,280
capacitor is and what happens is as you

945
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,630
start to move up in frequency you start

946
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,700
to see effects that you wouldn't have

947
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,590
seen at lower frequency so at low

948
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,420
frequencies you know just acts like a

949
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,139
pass etre charge up slowly as you move

950
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:18,390
towards DC that you know as true DC a

951
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,240
capacitor is just a block in the road

952
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,560
right in more practical terms below ten

953
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,760
megahertz it's just going to charge up

954
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,649
at a different rate depending on its

955
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,090
capacitance well as you move up into

956
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,860
higher and higher frequencies that

957
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,659
inductance starts to really matter and

958
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,790
what happens here is that the impedance

959
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,130
right which is a complex mix of

960
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,950
inductance and capacitance that starts

961
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,990
to invert as you move past this this

962
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,640
corner frequency and so your capacitor

963
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,680
which you thought was a capacitor that

964
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,450
blocking thing is now turning into an

965
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,620
inductor and that starts to really mess

966
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,150
up some of your circuits your filter

967
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,830
might change your signal path might

968
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,790
change and you really just need to keep

969
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,560
that in mind another this is a this is

970
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:57,090
kind of what inspired a lot of thinking

971
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,550
for this talk as well I was you know

972
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,780
looking at layout for how I would do

973
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,909
layout for like a really sensitive

974
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,250
amplifier maybe it you know we want to

975
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:07,380
make sure that it's nice and you know

976
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,090
you have drawn planes around it that's

977
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,970
fine right that's a lot of RF as well

978
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,949
but we would actually cut out around the

979
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,510
different different circuit elements so

980
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,980
you wouldn't have currents kind of

981
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,450
creeping in you wouldn't have these

982
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,010
these different things creeping

983
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,980
circa that and I say that was kind of

984
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:24,690
like with scare tags because I mean yes

985
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,830
that is how it works at DC but that's

986
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,470
not really how it works

987
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,340
as you move up in frequency again so

988
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,380
some of these are noise reduction

989
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,699
techniques that you might use an analog

990
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,290
you might with trying to isolate some of

991
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,400
your parts of your circuit using

992
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:38,600
physical means

993
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,220
but RF don't care that's kind of the

994
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,929
summary there so here's a half note from

995
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,460
hangs humble in one of my favorite

996
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,990
applications engineers from analog

997
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,760
devices and this is what he's showing

998
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,380
here is showing basically you cut out

999
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,660
you see that L there you're cutting

1000
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:56,790
around the precision analog section and

1001
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,540
that is less effective when you have

1002
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:02,370
high frequencies there so you need to

1003
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,420
basically at low frequencies the cut out

1004
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,219
means that they this you know the

1005
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,350
signals and the the noise that you might

1006
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,179
be generating with a with a switching

1007
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,400
your supply won't get around the cut but

1008
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,739
basically as you start to move up in

1009
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,460
frequency that same thing has other

1010
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,870
effects and so that's like at high speed

1011
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,159
it will treat this as a capacitor and

1012
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,270
quote unquote travel through to the

1013
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,739
other side but what it's really doing is

1014
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,719
it's radiating and what I'm showing here

1015
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,909
is an antenna that's actually made by

1016
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,469
cutting a slot in a plane which is the

1017
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,089
same thing I was doing so you could

1018
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,859
start to you know as you cut slots on

1019
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,200
planes to isolate things you could also

1020
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:37,080
be creating radiation points you might

1021
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,520
be failing EMC you might be pushing some

1022
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,350
energy into the RF spectrum that you

1023
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,159
didn't think you were and not

1024
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:46,080
necessarily the best idea another

1025
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,580
assumption here current follows the path

1026
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,139
of least resistance this is kind of a a

1027
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,880
well-known thing I suppose but it really

1028
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,580
is is it hears about impedance it

1029
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,050
doesn't care about resistance and so

1030
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,490
what this is showing that you know if

1031
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,320
you have a meandering path here it's

1032
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,270
going on you know this squirrely trace

1033
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,700
and it's going through a resistor it

1034
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,850
might you know it would go it would the

1035
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,790
current would flow back to the source

1036
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:13,500
directly right but what actually happens

1037
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,670
so at DC what happens is that this this

1038
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,310
is true right it's the path of least

1039
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,240
resistance it might be flowing through a

1040
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,520
ground plane it might be flowing through

1041
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,310
a VCC something similar like that but as

1042
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,570
you start to move up in speeds it starts

1043
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,210
to travel underneath the signal

1044
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:29,340
underneath the trace itself and that

1045
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,080
starts to have other impacts as well so

1046
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,810
if you started to go through a region of

1047
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,279
your board that you

1048
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,830
supposed to be going through that could

1049
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,590
have some impacts and the main thing to

1050
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:40,870
know is that it higher speeds the it it

1051
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,550
takes on complex terms right so the

1052
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,650
inductance really starts to matter in

1053
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,420
this case and so as the inductance

1054
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,280
matters more where the signal is going

1055
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,720
to travel is going to change as well and

1056
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,620
this happens because as so anyone anyone

1057
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,259
in the audience to remember the

1058
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,089
right-hand rule anyone physics yeah okay

1059
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,040
up a couple people so basically this is

1060
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,290
the right-hand rule in action right so

1061
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,020
as you have current going through a wire

1062
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:07,750
right the magnetic fields gonna curl

1063
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,430
around that wire but the the place where

1064
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,070
the inductance is going to be louis is

1065
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:13,210
where that cancels out so if if the

1066
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,530
current can flow anywhere in the

1067
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,740
anywhere in the universe its gonna want

1068
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:20,290
to flow directly underneath that that's

1069
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,580
that signal because flowing back

1070
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,140
underneath that signal it's gonna cancel

1071
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,549
out you don't have two right hands

1072
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,200
unfortunately that's going to cancel out

1073
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,700
the magnetic field as it was flowing

1074
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,859
that direction and that's gonna be the

1075
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,049
best place so it's gonna flow actually

1076
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,530
underneath right underneath that that

1077
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,870
line okay

1078
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,640
so that was kind of the DC stuff I had

1079
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,620
also promised in this talk you know how

1080
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,960
does this all apply to Bluetooth its

1081
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,220
cellular and Wi-Fi and lore and all the

1082
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,840
new features that kind of come out here

1083
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,580
so I wanted it done disambiguate all

1084
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,930
these things basically they're they're

1085
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,220
all the same thing so all of these

1086
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,210
lessons that I've been learning and

1087
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,189
hopefully you'll be learning or you have

1088
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,800
already learned they all apply because

1089
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,230
the RF energy you know basically and as

1090
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,790
you add antennas and as you add

1091
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,050
amplifiers everything else they're gonna

1092
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,420
be operating at different frequencies

1093
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,910
but they're going to be have the same

1094
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,200
fundamental rules applied to them the

1095
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,549
things that might change are the length

1096
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,410
of the antennas or the shape of the

1097
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,700
antennas or you know the amount of power

1098
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,410
that you have to put into the system and

1099
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,149
things like that but a lot of them are

1100
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,259
really just brand names and even more

1101
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,940
than that a lot of them are actually

1102
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,620
software stacks that are on top of

1103
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,140
radios that was something that took me a

1104
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,569
long time as well right so Bluetooth and

1105
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,560
Wi-Fi are both 2.4 gigahertz radios if

1106
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,850
you didn't know there's a lot of times

1107
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,860
your phone is actually using the same

1108
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,170
radio to do Bluetooth and Wi-Fi that

1109
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,750
kind of loop my mind when I learn that

1110
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,300
and if not the same radio then possibly

1111
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,630
the same antenna anyways wonder shows

1112
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,490
just some of the

1113
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,019
the frequency ranges we have here so

1114
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:45,229
again bluetooths is running 2.4 gig

1115
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:47,269
Wi-Fi is 2.4 gig and 5 Laura and Sig Fox

1116
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:51,289
these are kind of low low low power wide

1117
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:52,279
area networks 433 915 each 6 8 depends

1118
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:54,650
on where you are in the world and what

1119
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:56,900
you're using GSM and cellular have these

1120
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,309
multiple frequencies here but the idea

1121
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,839
is I wanted to show there's you know

1122
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,730
there's a bunch of set frequencies that

1123
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,900
you might be dealing with a lot of them

1124
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,799
are you know either

1125
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:08,900
as GSM goes or cellular goes a lot of

1126
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:11,089
them are spectrum that's been allocated

1127
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,039
by your local governing body FCC in the

1128
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:15,950
US and I sorry I don't know the European

1129
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,529
name here but the idea is that those are

1130
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,210
kind of pre pre allotted to these

1131
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,039
different technologies but then there's

1132
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,710
the more open ones like 2.4 gigahertz

1133
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:26,329
and 915 in the States and I SM ban and

1134
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,859
things like that and the idea is that

1135
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:29,269
you're going to be operating with all of

1136
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,578
these different frequencies but the

1137
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:32,868
underlying thing is are the same so

1138
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:36,109
let's talk about some resources that you

1139
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:38,180
might want to look at in order to do

1140
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:40,519
what I did I guess some of these are

1141
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,750
some books that I enjoyed a practical

1142
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,189
guide to RF and mixed signal this is

1143
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,200
interesting is this in that from the

1144
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,119
perspective that people were doing FPGAs

1145
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,399
for a long time and now FPGAs have

1146
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,529
radios going on boards as well right and

1147
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,509
there's moving from an 8 layer board to

1148
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,829
a 16 layer board because they now need

1149
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:56,960
to have the interplay of these different

1150
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:58,279
these of different layers and so I'm

1151
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,450
coming at it usually from the low level

1152
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:01,250
DC they're coming out from the high

1153
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,549
speed digital and seeing the difference

1154
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,779
in RF characteristics and what they have

1155
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:07,490
to do to their boards is pretty

1156
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:09,619
interesting other ones it's just a

1157
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,328
generic RF circuit design I enjoyed this

1158
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:13,730
one and then the final is a planar

1159
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:16,490
microwave engineering Thomas Lee Thomas

1160
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,230
is just like the famous guy in the

1161
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,729
industry is a microwave professor out at

1162
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,500
Stanford and it's just a really

1163
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,480
approachable book even there's a ton of

1164
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,970
math there's a lots of very funny

1165
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,269
footnotes that helps as you're punching

1166
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,459
through math as well ok sorry another

1167
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,689
one is YouTube I love watching YouTube

1168
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,799
videos I think that's kind of the

1169
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,549
highest bandwidth transfer of

1170
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:38,809
information Alan loki is w2 aw he's got

1171
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:40,700
a great channel that's how I learned too

1172
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,740
so I started learning Smith chart things

1173
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,390
and he's a ham radio operator times

1174
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,430
other great information there and then

1175
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,279
Shahriyar who does a signal path that's

1176
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,740
how I found out about one of those

1177
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,359
one of those VNA's he has a great review

1178
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,390
of those and then he also looks at the

1179
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,740
67 gigahertz $500,000 once he of course

1180
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,080
has to give them back at the end and

1181
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,368
then finally a really accessible way to

1182
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,950
get started for a lot of this stuff I

1183
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:06,099
think are you know things like my cosmic

1184
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:08,169
grayscale gadgets hack RF that's a SDR

1185
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,730
and so you just kind of get a feel for

1186
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,740
what's out in the world another one is

1187
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,290
good new radio plus RT LS SDR that's

1188
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,209
like a $20.00 thing and they're actually

1189
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,609
here somewhere in the camp I think

1190
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,020
they're given a workshop today too and

1191
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:21,609
and then there's a analog devices Pluto

1192
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,690
these are all existing things you're not

1193
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:24,880
gonna be building radios but you're

1194
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,109
gonna be interacting with radios on the

1195
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,810
software side and that'll probably get

1196
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:30,790
you more into the hardware side so a

1197
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,109
quick thank you to Jeff Keizer or mighty

1198
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,060
ohm he helped me he create these slides

1199
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:36,299
and Derek Kozel who is actually the you

1200
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,570
know radio person did this stuff and

1201
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,570
thanks for coming

1202
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,510
so thanks to Chris for a very

1203
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,890
interesting talk we have some time for

1204
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,050
questions so if you have a question

1205
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,540
there's a microphone right over here you

1206
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,710
can step up and as you requested but we

1207
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:03,440
also have a question from the internet

1208
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:05,690
apparently no no customer from the

1209
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,610
internet okay question here the

1210
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:14,300
microphone I have a question is it

1211
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:16,910
better to run our app through inner

1212
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,460
layers or outer layers

1213
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,440
the question was inner layers or outer

1214
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,120
layers I think the the main thing is as

1215
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,010
long as it's reference to ground is the

1216
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,150
main thing inner layers versus outer

1217
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,710
layers are going to have different

1218
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,210
characteristics because it's basically

1219
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,680
an outer layer is dealing with the

1220
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,270
dielectric of the board and then

1221
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,200
dielectric of air so it's gonna have

1222
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,230
different like strip line

1223
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,089
characteristics but usually what I've

1224
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,700
been into so far at least it's been real

1225
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,080
simple it's been top layer you know like

1226
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,000
like Mike says in his it his

1227
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,529
presentation to it you do that first so

1228
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,060
nothing's in the way usually I think of

1229
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,370
inner layers you're doing that because a

1230
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,870
lot of things are in the way but I

1231
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,190
wouldn't want to go through any you know

1232
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,710
vias or anything like that I want to

1233
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,680
just get it as close as possible to the

1234
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:00,860
output port and getting it there so your

1235
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,319
mileage may vary yes another question oh

1236
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:07,640
yeah thanks for the talk are you aware

1237
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:11,420
of any FPGA like devices that use RF

1238
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:14,960
circuits so the one that I was looking

1239
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,400
at was the I think the zinc has an RF

1240
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,150
front-end now they're not gonna be cheap

1241
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,770
though that's the main thing so I would

1242
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,930
recommend that I mean I'm a big fan of

1243
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,160
like the open toolchain stuff is happen

1244
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,350
with ice 40s I think there's some of

1245
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,759
that stuff go pop one of those for 33

1246
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:32,299
megahertz radios on there otherwise

1247
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,800
though not really sure about anything at

1248
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,850
a certain point though the you know so

1249
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,510
that was like a transmitter right you're

1250
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:40,220
basically pumping data that the the fact

1251
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,470
of like an FPGA working with a

1252
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,669
transmitter is you know it's just gonna

1253
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,330
be pushing data to it you could do the

1254
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,770
same with a micro or you know you could

1255
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,990
key it in you wanna if you if you if it

1256
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:53,120
could go slow enough of course but the

1257
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,379
main thing is that the the trance the

1258
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,420
transmitter itself is going to be

1259
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,100
usually separate from the FPGA I don't

1260
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,060
know of any integrator ones especially

1261
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,060
not

1262
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,740
the lower end where I'm usually looking

1263
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:05,900
any more questions final question

1264
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,310
okay if nothing that please give Krista

1265
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,520
big run applause thank you thanks for

1266
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,520
coming

1267
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,519
[Music]

1268
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,160
you
