1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:17,080
[Music]

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,630
introduce you in the next talk it's

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,839
gonna be by Eunice Geisler he's going to

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,520
talk about power 2x and dive a little

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,700
bit into carbon capturing and

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,448
utilization so I'm especially interested

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,160
in this since you know our planet is

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:35,350
burning and we're trying really hard to

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,690
save it so I hope

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,340
Yanis can give us some hints about how

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:49,229
that might be possible so please give a

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:51,970
warm welcome to Jonas thank you yeah hi

13
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:55,210
a warm welcome from my side as well to

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,370
my talk and yeah as already announced I

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:02,199
will talk about how to make things from

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:06,940
electricity or power tricks and the

17
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:09,580
outline of my talk is first what is the

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,690
idea behind power 2x and what does this

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,980
mysterious X might stand for then I want

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,289
to talk about carbon capture and

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,580
utilization like a group of techniques

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,460
which fall under this large word of

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,009
power tweaks then I want to talk about

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,649
the energy sector a little and the

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,770
chemistry sector so where this could be

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,320
applied and and why this might make

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,530
sense to do this so in the hopefully

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,880
very near future

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,170
so yeah the phrase power to eeks

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,649
basically the idea is when we're

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,830
generating renewable energy we produce

32
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,540
at certain times sufficient electricity

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,000
at certain times not sufficient

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,790
electricity and at other times surplus

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,470
electricity and this surplus electricity

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,110
the idea was what to do with it like we

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,740
have it we have it as a resource do

38
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,870
something with it and there is where the

39
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,429
first word you will find when you're

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,920
searching for word power to X terms

41
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:16,659
comes into the game which is the trivial

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:21,159
solution which is sorry power - well you

43
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:22,540
so make something valuable and we will

44
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,090
see later on that

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,230
the idea of using surplus energy won't

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,629
be enough but that's basically the idea

47
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,329
by the way power in that case usually is

48
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:38,549
electricity so not that you're confused

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:42,700
power refers always to to to electricity

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:46,480
then when we got this idea like power -

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,030
well you we can ask us the question like

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,899
what do we need and there comes the next

53
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,670
group of terms we can use into play and

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,099
the first one I want to present you is

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,018
power - power so now you might think

56
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,849
that's stupid

57
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,829
we have power why should we do something

58
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,840
to make power but that's basically

59
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:08,140
referring to all the energy storage

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,910
things like storing to make the grid

61
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,839
stable 4 times where we don't have

62
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:19,870
sufficient electricity supply and use it

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,579
then the next is heat heat is one of the

64
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,000
main fields besides electricity where we

65
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:29,350
put energy in so why not make heat with

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,319
that power third one mobility same thing

67
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,049
we have a certain field where we need a

68
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,720
lot of energy let's bring electricity to

69
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,760
that field

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,700
the next thing chemicals that will be

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,560
something I will talk a lot about

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,690
because carbon capture and utilization

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,930
is mainly about chemicals

74
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,359
yeah can we use that electricity to

75
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,750
produce chemicals in a efficient way and

76
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:58,600
in a renewable way and the last term one

77
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,940
might find is food in that field one

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,239
might find more terms but this is

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,010
basically what is the most common so

80
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:13,269
maybe we can also use it to produce some

81
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:15,910
food yeah now we have our needs in the

82
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,519
basics the question is now what products

83
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,510
can we actually make and they would come

84
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,760
to a very often hurt term power to gas

85
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,159
this mainly refers to methane and

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,159
hydrogen where we have another terms

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,800
power to maintain power to hydrogen

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,800
so let's produce gases which are storing

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,180
energy for us and we can apply them for

90
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,150
certain

91
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,830
very similar power to fuel or power to

92
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,620
liquid which is essentially the same

93
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,380
like when referring to fuels by that

94
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,510
term we very often think of liquid fuels

95
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,730
and when referring of liquids we very

96
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,810
often think of a fuel application so

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:05:00,070
that's that's rather similar and the

98
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:02,710
next one would be soon gas soon gas is

99
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,230
the mixture of carbon monoxide and

100
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,780
hydrogen which is very often used in

101
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,690
chemical industry so I will talk about

102
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:14,020
that later power to sin gas

103
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,570
yeah is what's meant with that you can

104
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,549
find power to ammonia ammonia is one of

105
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,280
the chemicals we are producing in very

106
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,840
large scale and which is very energy

107
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,580
demanding we're burning a lot of fossil

108
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,049
fuels to fuels to make ammonia and the

109
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,300
last one I want to show you is protein

110
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,580
which is a rather interesting idea as

111
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,820
well to make proteins directly using

112
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,280
that energy by some some chemistry now

113
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,290
how they are interconnected so all these

114
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,090
three energy applications refer mainly

115
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,720
to gas and fuel a little too soon gas

116
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,700
the chemicals of course like when we're

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,090
speaking of chemical products that's all

118
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,690
chemistry and food as many ammonia do to

119
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,390
virtualize a production and protein but

120
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,880
I won't talk too much about food ammonia

121
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,880
and and proteins I will mention ammonia

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,350
at some certain point but that's not the

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,630
focus of the talk now is that new and I

124
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,660
would say no that's just like modern bus

125
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:17,380
wording cause power to power we have

126
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,800
since a long time this is a hydro pump

127
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,210
station from the 30s power to heed you

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,190
might know such devices from your

129
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:30,010
grandparents power to mobility you this

130
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,590
is a bus from the 40s and power to

131
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,570
chemicals this is a chloral karlie

132
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,119
electrolyzers of producing chlorine gas

133
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,930
and sodium hydroxide solution from the

134
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,229
1920s so we have power to whatever

135
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,870
already the thing is just in times of

136
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:49,060
climate change and an increasing amount

137
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,600
of renewable energy it becomes more

138
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,090
interest

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,940
and new technologies could be

140
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,349
implemented but the general power to

141
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:02,710
something terms are nothing really new

142
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:05,830
now coming more to carbon capture and

143
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:09,549
utilization what we are doing in our

144
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:12,310
energy sector usually is we take fossil

145
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,270
carbon then we make some fuels out of it

146
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,130
we make one of those fields of energy we

147
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,669
are using and in the end we end up with

148
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:23,740
a co2 and water if we think of the

149
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,570
chemical sector we're doing the same

150
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,750
we're making commodity chemicals so like

151
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:33,190
the large-scale chemicals produced in in

152
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,870
really Megaton scale worldwide and from

153
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,500
those we producing all the fancy

154
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,570
products we have around us and at the

155
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,130
end of the light hopefully we burn them

156
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,500
or we degrade them to see you two in

157
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,180
water because if we don't do that we end

158
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,930
up with waste which is even more

159
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,670
problematic usually so this is very

160
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,960
linear we're coming from fossil fuels

161
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,030
and we commit going to see you two in

162
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,250
water and I guess that's not very new to

163
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,119
you but carbon capture and utilization

164
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,520
now means that I'd capture this co2 and

165
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,680
water again and I utilize it and make

166
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,130
exactly that fuels and commodity

167
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,320
chemicals to have a circle like no more

168
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:16,060
co2 should be produced but we're just

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,099
driving it in a circle very important

170
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,230
from the beginning we are not reducing

171
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,870
co2 as long as we're not producing way

172
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,700
more products as the products are

173
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,070
already there and we're just bringing

174
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,550
new products we're just lowering the

175
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:33,640
amount of new co2 emitted to make that

176
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,430
clear a lot of startups say something

177
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,530
like negative co2 emissions by carbon

178
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,929
capture and utilization you need to

179
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,150
really look into the detail if they

180
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:47,589
store somewhere the carbon or if they

181
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:49,569
really do yeah calm capture and

182
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,730
utilization and then they usually have

183
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,720
no negative emissions but I come to that

184
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:58,720
later again as well now this looks nice

185
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,790
but till now it's a perpetual mobile air

186
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,520
so of course we need to put in the

187
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,270
renewable energy

188
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,000
and we could either do that directly by

189
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:13,020
putting it into the energy sectors and

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,360
using this energy there or we could just

191
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,569
drive that cycle around by putting it

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,920
into capturing co2 from point sources we

193
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,210
can't avoid or from the dye from the air

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,740
around us which is a little more

195
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,490
complicated because the concentration is

196
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,130
very low but still possible and also

197
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,230
possible on a large scale and in the end

198
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,480
hopefully we get rid of this fossil

199
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:42,150
carbon but just having this cycle

200
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:48,780
ongoing when we look at exactly the same

201
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:53,069
thing from another point of view we come

202
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:55,770
to for example this energy scale and we

203
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:59,310
see different carbon products and the

204
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,710
and oxygen combined have a certain

205
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,160
energy level stored within the chemical

206
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,770
bonds and what we usually do when we

207
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,400
when we burn them which happens at a

208
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:13,290
certain point well as I said we kicked

209
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,630
them over the activation barrier and

210
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,199
then we throw them all the way down the

211
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:21,990
hill till we end up with co2 and water

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,820
which is really what for chemists to

213
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,890
tune water's quite stable so we're

214
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,110
really down at the bottom of the energy

215
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,030
somehow which is good because we wanted

216
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,610
to get this energy out of the reaction

217
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,439
but which also is a problem because now

218
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:40,260
we need to bring that back up again and

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,170
the question is how could we do that how

220
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,180
does that work

221
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,670
can we just heat up co2 and water and

222
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,120
all our nice products fall out again

223
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:54,060
that's sadly not that easy and at first

224
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,940
I want to talk about techniques which

225
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,939
are already like have a technology

226
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,390
readiness level very high so which are

227
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,020
could be implemented in in large-scale

228
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:08,970
reactions kind of already like minor

229
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:12,900
optimizations still needed but but we

230
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,180
could do that today and therefore we

231
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,170
take apart the the water and the co2

232
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,370
part

233
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,910
the first step we make water

234
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,070
electrolysis just to remind you like

235
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,370
water electrolysis you put two

236
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:30,510
electrodes into a salt solution you

237
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:33,209
apply electricity and from the anode you

238
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,829
will have oxygen Evolvin and from the

239
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:38,310
cathode you will have hydrogen involving

240
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:41,339
so far so easy like for chemists we know

241
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,888
that optimizing that is not that easy

242
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:48,750
but it's known technology we can still

243
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:50,910
make it better but it's out there so now

244
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,000
we have hydrogen and oxygen like we

245
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,769
already produce the oxygen we put in in

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,579
the beginning now we want to have our

247
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:01,980
product and therefore we combine this

248
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:05,760
hydrogen and co2 and then we go over

249
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:09,810
certain reactions which are downhill in

250
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:14,790
energy so we are getting energy out of

251
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:17,219
that again but why because the products

252
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,829
are uphill that is because we put in

253
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,709
more hydrogen from the beginning to

254
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,930
produce again water so we're splitting

255
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:28,439
water and using that water to reduce the

256
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:32,010
co2 to our products and we perform water

257
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,480
at the same time now you might have seen

258
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,980
such pictures in school at a certain

259
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:44,220
time when people were talking about

260
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:46,470
catalysts and catalysts from what I hear

261
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,480
from people who tell me what they heard

262
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:53,730
in school is this strange things which

263
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,459
makes erection fast or some some people

264
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,760
or still remember the thing that lowers

265
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,739
the activation barrier but what does

266
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,810
actually happen there and I want to make

267
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,269
the experiment to get your better

268
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:10,099
glimpse of what a catalyzed reaction

269
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:12,959
looks like by visualizing it and

270
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,120
therefore we take this picture we have

271
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,399
that very nice catalyst surface which is

272
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,370
very ordered and which is not the

273
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,529
reality for the experts this is also not

274
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,810
the outcome of some simulation or

275
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:28,319
whatever it's just a visualization how

276
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,969
such a reaction could look like in the

277
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:33,000
micro scale on the server

278
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:37,439
phase four for single molecules and

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,829
atoms and now this co2 is linear

280
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:43,680
molecule somewhere in the gas phase or

281
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,209
in a liquid phase which makes it more

282
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,329
complex but we're just looking at the

283
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:53,579
co2 here above this catalyst surface and

284
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:57,508
if we have the right math material what

285
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:59,939
could happen is that the co2 adsorbed to

286
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:03,839
the to one surface a term or to a group

287
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:08,250
of surface atoms and you already see

288
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,110
that I drawn this u2 molecule AB and so

289
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,509
it's not linear anymore and that might

290
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,579
be already one step where the activation

291
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,220
barrier is reduced because it's now

292
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,199
accessible for reactions from some

293
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,939
angles which were not there before and

294
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,370
the Elat or e electron density is

295
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:26,370
different and all that so that might be

296
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,310
even more reactive than before just by

297
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,579
absorbing it to that surface now we want

298
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,768
to react it this with hydrogen now we

299
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,258
saw we put in a hydrogen molecule and

300
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,360
some catalysts for example are capable

301
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,509
of splitting that hydrogen molecule

302
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,230
where it would never happen in normal

303
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:48,990
cases and this might look like this so

304
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,540
we form something we call surface

305
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,300
hydride so we have single hydrogen atoms

306
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,689
sitting on the surface and they are

307
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,849
splitted up at a rather low temperatures

308
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:02,459
and now we have that in very close

309
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,379
proximity on the surface and what could

310
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,050
happen is that one of the hydrogen atoms

311
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,449
just jumps to one of the oxygen atoms

312
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,059
and we formed a surface carbonyl group

313
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:14,729
this carbonyl group already is our first

314
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,550
reaction we have reduced carbon dioxide

315
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,149
to something not really useful yet but

316
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,889
we already did it next step the the

317
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:28,379
other hydrogen could jump to the very

318
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:31,620
same oxygen so this is not stable this

319
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:35,220
oxygen has three bonds in that case this

320
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,819
should in most of the cases break apart

321
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,939
and this is exactly what happens and we

322
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:44,079
form water which is in the gas phase and

323
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:47,620
we have carbon monoxide

324
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,680
still bound to the surface and now we

325
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:54,160
could do all kinds of things so if the

326
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,859
surface keeps that co absorbed we can

327
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,920
react it further and make one carbon

328
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:05,470
containing small molecules like methane

329
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:07,540
methanol all that stuff or we can have

330
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,640
another carbon monoxide at the same

331
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,980
surface very close and then something

332
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,170
similar could happen like where the

333
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,480
hydrogen atom reacted with the oxygen

334
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,790
but the two carbon atoms in a close

335
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,000
proximity now react and that's where we

336
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,160
form like longer carbon chains and there

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,160
we make complex more complex molecules

338
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,010
so not really complex still like two

339
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,160
carbon atoms three carbon atoms ten

340
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:37,420
carbon atoms in a chain or something but

341
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,160
yeah we form form a product and the last

342
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,530
thing which could happen this catalyst

343
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,689
is just not capable to keep that carbon

344
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,310
monoxide on the surface and it desorbs

345
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:50,440
and we produce carbon monoxide which

346
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,910
could also be fine so I hopefully could

347
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,510
explain you now a little more how this

348
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,740
catalysts thing might work and now the

349
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,260
question is what are their reactions

350
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,440
which we can use and the first thing you

351
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,349
already seen water electrolysis is in

352
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,820
that case the first step

353
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:09,310
you've also already seen the so-called

354
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:12,280
reverse water gas shift reaction where

355
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,230
we produce carbon monoxide from co2 and

356
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,609
hydrogen even if it in reality on the

357
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,980
real catalyst this might look a little

358
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,729
different but similar to what I've shown

359
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,589
you this could happen now I said carbon

360
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,780
monoxide can be a useful product and

361
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,240
they come back to the synthesis gas or

362
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,070
syngas I already mentioned and with this

363
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,810
in different mixtures we can do a lot of

364
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:37,419
things like mixture one or two two one

365
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:39,730
produces LPG so liquid petroleum gas

366
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:43,450
this is what you have in your camping

367
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,800
cooker butter bottles NAFTA is a certain

368
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,140
fraction you usually get when you

369
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,710
distill crude oil which is very useful

370
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:54,679
in chemical industry diesel which is

371
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:57,679
also something like that if you put in

372
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,440
like two to one you get for example

373
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,320
methanol ethanol demacia liter or

374
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,440
gasoline and with a mixture of three to

375
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:11,678
one you end up with methane or so called

376
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:15,230
SN G which is synthetic natural gas so

377
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,899
we which means exactly the same

378
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:21,019
basically because natural gas contains

379
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:27,049
mainly methane synthetic natural natural

380
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:29,600
gas usually is methane so here we are

381
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:31,730
already very happy we have a three-step

382
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,590
process and we produce all kinds of

383
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,510
things we can use

384
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,699
and the problem is by having a lot of

385
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,399
steps in a reaction we multiply the

386
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,090
efficiency and thereby the efficiency

387
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:47,178
goes down so we are always very happy if

388
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,370
we can produce things in few steps so

389
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:52,490
there's for example the reaction of co2

390
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:55,070
and hydrogen to methanol directly on one

391
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,320
catalyst in one step so we only have the

392
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,360
efficiency loss of one step instead of

393
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,740
two steps the reverse water gas shift

394
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,330
and the corresponding sin gas reaction

395
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,880
so we might have an increase in

396
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,949
efficiency by doing that if that

397
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,929
reaction is more efficient than the two

398
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:17,029
steps combined same principle with the

399
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:18,740
sabaki reaction there would takes you

400
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:22,940
two and hydrogen and might directly

401
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:26,120
methane without going two steps and one

402
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,289
reaction I want to to mention here even

403
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,449
if it's not carbon capture and

404
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,760
utilization is the harbor Bosch reaction

405
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,950
because we in principle it works the

406
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,350
same we could make the hydrogen from

407
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,500
from water electrolysis and react that

408
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:45,799
was nitrogen and there's exactly where

409
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:48,350
the reduction in producing ammonia in a

410
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:51,139
way that is more sustainable comes in

411
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,090
because usually the hydrogen and

412
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:55,340
chemical industry today is produced by a

413
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:59,090
lot of fossil fuels so you burn fossil

414
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,070
fuels with a too little oxygen to fully

415
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,279
fully burn it and you get a lot of

416
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,309
hydrogen out of there so if we would

417
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,690
just use

418
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,658
hydrogen from water electrolysis which

419
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,619
is more expensive today but would be way

420
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:19,460
more sustainable just to give you one

421
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:23,539
further example is I want to point out

422
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:28,309
on this direct methanol synthesis for a

423
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:31,519
second and we form methanol and the

424
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,769
picture you see is the George olá plant

425
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,999
in Iceland and it's named after a very

426
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:42,230
interesting person who made the concept

427
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:45,320
of methanol economy so like basically

428
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,059
like our today's economy is a oil

429
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,689
economy where we produce nearly

430
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:53,869
everything we have around us from oil he

431
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:56,059
proposes a economy that uses methanol as

432
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:58,100
the central resource and that's why they

433
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:01,090
called this plant after him because they

434
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,049
are producing four kilo tons a year of

435
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,220
methanol or at least they have the

436
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:11,029
capacity to do so this might seem not

437
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:14,210
too much when looking at a hundred

438
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:16,639
Megaton a year worldwide methanol

439
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,889
consumption but keep in mind that's just

440
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:22,359
one plant and we also don't have just

441
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:24,738
one plant producing methanol today and

442
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:29,480
it's one of the first plants who does

443
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:33,649
exactly that producing soot from co2 and

444
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,279
water by the use of a quasi renewable

445
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:40,518
energy in form of give thermal energy

446
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:42,350
producing methanol for the people who

447
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,090
are interested typical catalysts which

448
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,748
you could use for this process would be

449
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,129
a combination of copper and zinc oxide

450
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:51,289
I'm not sure if they are using it

451
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:53,059
because they for sure don't tell which

452
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,279
catalysts they're using but this would

453
00:21:53,059 --> 00:22:01,730
be would be something typical one could

454
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:03,529
use let's go back to this picture where

455
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,739
you said away I showed you all these

456
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:10,489
steps we're going through in the

457
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:12,649
processes I've shown you till now these

458
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:15,320
are the processes like I said which are

459
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:20,050
on a technology ready a readiness level

460
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:23,389
that we could do that today basically

461
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,830
but you've seen it's a lot of steps and

462
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,720
I told you that a lot of steps sometimes

463
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,790
it's not good so let's look a little

464
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,820
more into the future and could we go

465
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:36,649
like one step and there's something

466
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,439
promising and this is actually the field

467
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:43,790
where I'm working in in a more detailed

468
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,460
way in my PhD and this is electric

469
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:49,520
catalytic co2 reduction so you've seen

470
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,790
the same picture as in the slide before

471
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,920
where I explained water electrolysis so

472
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,470
what do we change we put into YouTube

473
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,880
and then for sure we need to change the

474
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,560
catalyst material I don't know if you

475
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,110
really seen that but the color of the

476
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:07,220
one electrode changed and what will

477
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,120
happen then when we have the right

478
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:14,900
catalyst we get directly our renewable

479
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:19,750
carbon product or like yeah hydrocarbon

480
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:23,720
product and what could be those products

481
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:26,990
the first one formic acid formic acid is

482
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,630
a chemical which has a certain role in

483
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,600
chemical industries several kilotons a

484
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,660
year it's not too large but we can

485
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,480
produce it that way and already kind of

486
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,780
efficiently it is not like industrial

487
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,450
level yet but but that that works and we

488
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,940
can do the carbon monoxide which I also

489
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,670
said before that is useful and there I

490
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,380
know that some German companies are

491
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,270
right now bill trying to build a

492
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,250
commercial plant to do exactly that and

493
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,510
that step I won't mention companies

494
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,580
because I don't want to make stupid

495
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:03,260
advertisements but there is something

496
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:06,460
going on other products we could do a

497
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:10,210
could make is methane and ethylene

498
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:13,670
methane again synthetic natural gas and

499
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:19,100
ethyle on it would be the real thing

500
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:23,210
because ethylene is I think the chemical

501
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,300
made from from oil with like the largest

502
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,250
chemical made from oil because we are

503
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,899
producing a lot of polyethylene as

504
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:34,170
plastics and we can use it also for all

505
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:38,160
other kinds of things we also we has a

506
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:41,730
very large variety to make things out of

507
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,770
ethylene but methane and ethylene to be

508
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,740
honest are more on a scale where it

509
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:50,550
works in a lab and it's still not really

510
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:54,450
sure if we can bring that to industrial

511
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,540
scale but it might work and yeah like I

512
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,540
said that's what I'm trying to work on

513
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:07,920
or being part of large community working

514
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:10,290
on that so now I've talked a lot about

515
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,880
the processes and the chemistry behind

516
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:17,550
it let's see can we use that and like I

517
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,580
said to you I want to talk about the

518
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,550
energy sector and just to give you an

519
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,169
estimation the primary energy

520
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:29,340
consumption of the world is something

521
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:33,360
like 600 exajoules a year which equals

522
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,120
something like 167 petawatt hours that's

523
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,240
what we are using in form of gas and oil

524
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,340
and coal and renewables like all the

525
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,410
things we put into the energy sector in

526
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:48,240
the beginning and the three different

527
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:51,020
things I told you before electricity

528
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,610
transport or mobility and Heat are

529
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,450
roughly a third of each like in Germany

530
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:01,678
we need a little more heat because of

531
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,700
cold winters and in in other parts of

532
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,770
the world we have a little more

533
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,000
electricity so rough estimation

534
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:11,970
one-third each so now the question is if

535
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,550
we can mainly produce renewable energies

536
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:18,660
in the form of electricity how do we

537
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:20,520
bring that into that fields and we can

538
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,850
start with something which is very well

539
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,950
known mechanical storage and pumping up

540
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:30,800
water hill and we can calculate roughly

541
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:34,590
one kilogram of water we're pumping

542
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,139
uphill for a hundred meters and we

543
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:41,629
roughly come out at something like 0.3

544
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:44,350
watt hours which are contained within

545
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:49,490
the water

546
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,590
yeah more uphill that's something and

547
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,560
that's useful we've seen that people are

548
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,899
doing that with hydro pump storage but

549
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,860
we might put in more energy and then we

550
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,960
can go to terminal

551
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:05,449
energy storage and now we take the same

552
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,120
kilogram of water and heat it up from 25

553
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,100
degrees roughly room temperature to

554
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:17,120
boiling and we see we come to something

555
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:22,689
like 87 kilowatt hours in the same exact

556
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:25,399
same kilogram of water this is rough a

557
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:29,330
hundred a factor of two orders of

558
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:32,030
magnitude so now we can go to chemical

559
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:37,520
storage which is the thing and talking

560
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:41,450
to you since roughly half an hour and

561
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,010
then we can put in 3.7 kilowatt hours by

562
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:49,550
splitting the water into hydrogen and

563
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:52,550
oxygen this is again something like two

564
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:54,470
orders of magnitude higher that's the

565
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,659
reason basically why you don't see cars

566
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,540
driving around with hydro pump storage

567
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:02,300
because we couldn't just bring in enough

568
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,430
water and height into the into the into

569
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,260
the car to make that but we you only

570
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:14,110
have chemicals or electrochemical

571
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:17,420
driving a car now when we go to a

572
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:20,929
electrochemical storage I want to show

573
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:24,170
you this so-called Dragoon II plot which

574
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:28,040
draws the energy density by weight so

575
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:30,830
how much energy in one kilogram over the

576
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,220
energy density by volume how much energy

577
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:37,820
in one liter and if you are not too

578
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,130
familiar with the joules up there there

579
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:45,649
is one mega Joule is something like a

580
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:49,640
quarter kilowatt hour now let's take the

581
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:55,090
absolute standard which is lad acid like

582
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:57,230
car batteries which is down there it's

583
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,330
also as it

584
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,220
applications and weight-wise it's still

585
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,799
the largest energy market just cause

586
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,400
ladders heavy but we're still producing

587
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,129
mainly lad acid concerning weight some

588
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,220
of you might remember nickel-cadmium

589
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:16,460
which is prohibited due to the toxic

590
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,410
cadmium the better thing is a nickel

591
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,750
metal hydride that's what you know from

592
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:24,200
like normal the cylindrical battery

593
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,210
shaped rechargeable batteries that's

594
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,600
nickel metal hydride and then of course

595
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:32,840
lithium ion technology we can bring in a

596
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,270
lot of energy into these batteries and

597
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:40,120
you all have that in a whole lot of

598
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:45,168
devices but if that's still not enough

599
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:48,469
we need to go to a different scale and

600
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:51,440
we put all the batteries down there

601
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:54,770
and now we come to hydrogen hydrogen is

602
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,559
somewhere in that region and why is it

603
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:01,850
in such a broad region it's cause we

604
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:04,399
have hydrogen storage in materials which

605
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,260
is essentially a sponge sucking up

606
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,570
hydrogen but we have that additional

607
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,629
material in the storage so it becomes

608
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:16,850
heavier and is low in the energy density

609
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:19,610
by weight we have the gauges and the at

610
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:23,469
700 bar compressed and the liquefied so

611
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:26,629
that's what makes up this this square

612
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:29,090
but we see now we are very good in

613
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:32,650
energy density by white hydrogen is very

614
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:35,510
light but by density we there still

615
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:39,320
place above there and there is where the

616
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:41,299
C based materials come in and for to

617
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,760
give you some examples there we have

618
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:45,770
methanol down there we have gasoline up

619
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,410
there and that's also why electric

620
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,600
vehicle doesn't drive that far but it's

621
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:54,140
like three times as heavy as a normal

622
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,870
car that's exactly the thing why

623
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,240
gasoline is so good and from my personal

624
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,729
perspective I can't imagine a jet flying

625
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,730
with batteries because they would be too

626
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:09,090
heavy we need some some fuel that drives

627
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:14,080
them which is lighter and denser

628
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:18,330
so yeah that's why the the carbon

629
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:23,830
products are very interesting and

630
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:26,980
another thing why carbon products are

631
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,019
very interesting is because we know how

632
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,149
to handle them we have a large

633
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:33,519
infrastructure all around the globe to

634
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:36,100
transport them to store them to supply

635
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,669
them to to the applications we know what

636
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,668
to do

637
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:44,409
we just need to install capacities to

638
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:47,859
produce them from a renewable way but

639
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:50,769
where are the downsides if we're looking

640
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:55,689
at the downsides we come to that graph

641
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:58,090
and I really want to emphasize the work

642
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,609
of the group of angry body which do a

643
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:08,139
really great work in making these life

644
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:11,830
cycle assessments of these technologies

645
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:15,549
and what we see is the global warming

646
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:19,449
impact a measured in kilogram co2

647
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:24,190
equivalence so like greenhouse gases in

648
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:26,440
general or coming from certain products

649
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,239
we are producing by a carbon capture and

650
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,509
utilization technique so we have this

651
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:38,769
orange dotted lines of methane we have

652
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:42,009
this violet line is jet fuel and

653
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:44,259
different kinds of things and it's drawn

654
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:46,690
over the global warming impact of the

655
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:52,480
electricity we use to drive that process

656
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:56,559
and the vertical line is fossil diesel

657
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,059
so if we are above that line by driving

658
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,539
that carbon capture and utilization

659
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:04,330
cycle we're producing more glow

660
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:08,679
greenhouse gases then just using fossil

661
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:11,619
diesel and then we have this no the

662
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,869
other did I said a horizontal line I

663
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:16,658
think I said vertical line the

664
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:20,510
horizontal line is the the the fossil

665
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:23,390
diesel the the vertical lines are

666
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,430
the grid mixes of certain countries the

667
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,620
the intermediate grid makes us for

668
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:32,180
example the one right out there at

669
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:34,580
something like 370 grams co2 equivalent

670
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:39,110
per kilowatt-hour there is the you great

671
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:41,960
mix proposed for 2020 then we have the

672
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:44,149
you grid mix for 2050 which is still not

673
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,310
sufficient to produce anything

674
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:49,580
we have switched to a Switzerland with

675
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:52,330
this which is on the border of there

676
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,129
could be something useful we have France

677
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,899
which are very low in global warming

678
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,310
impact of their electricity because

679
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,770
they're using a lot of nuclear power

680
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:03,620
which is a total different discussion if

681
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:06,710
that is by any means helpful but but

682
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:11,900
they could do something on that field

683
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:14,449
and as at the best we have Iceland which

684
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,370
has really high amount of green

685
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,109
electricity in their grid and we have

686
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,029
the wind benchmark which is the

687
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,800
technology which is also not zero

688
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:25,190
because we are producing for example a

689
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,700
lot of concrete to be to build the

690
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,320
windmill and that produces a lot of co2

691
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:35,199
but it's still the best technology we

692
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,000
have global global warming impact wise

693
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:43,790
so yeah it makes only sense if we have a

694
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:47,210
lot of very green electricity going to

695
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:50,060
the chemical sector we have a graph that

696
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:54,250
it's slightly more complicated but it

697
00:34:50,060 --> 00:35:00,130
essentially says shows the mass flows

698
00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:02,690
from fossil fuels to the 20 largest

699
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,960
chemicals produced from fossil fuels

700
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:08,840
usually which have 75 percent of the

701
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:13,160
greenhouse gas emissions of the chemical

702
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:17,140
industry so that's like a model which

703
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,299
can refer to basically the whole

704
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:24,020
chemical industry and they modeled it

705
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,090
for these 20 chemicals and we see this

706
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,340
fossil fuels are over different

707
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,100
processes split up in what I said before

708
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,880
ethylene methanol poly olefins so

709
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,860
plastics

710
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
aromatics that didn't speak a lot about

711
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:41,760
them but or essentially not an ammonium

712
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,790
which is not a carbon-based but as I

713
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,970
said we put in a lot of fossil fuels to

714
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:50,190
to produce it now what is the

715
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:54,180
alternative of this thing which is the

716
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:56,940
proposal proposed mass flows so like

717
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:01,109
this size of the line refers to a mass

718
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:05,850
flow to this mass flows which are

719
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:10,050
proposed for 2034 by just using fossil

720
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:12,839
fuels on I said when I showed you

721
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:16,470
methanol I said something like methanol

722
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:19,880
economy and they made a model it's again

723
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:23,819
worked from from the group of an robado

724
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,980
where they basically use methanol as a

725
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:29,580
central chemic chemistry because they

726
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,810
say this is high in the technology

727
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:38,819
readiness level so we can could do that

728
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:41,100
right away but if you see that right the

729
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,940
outcome should be the same like we're

730
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:50,370
producing a certain amount of chemicals

731
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:52,560
in 2030 maybe and not it should not

732
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,250
depend on the way we produce it how much

733
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,920
we need of it

734
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,560
so actually we can scale that down here

735
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,310
so if we make that and capture the

736
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,500
carbon dioxide and use hydrogen by the

737
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,049
way here the hydrogen you see the

738
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,990
hydrogen mass flow going in this comes

739
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:12,390
from water this is why a lot of water

740
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,660
comes out of this reaction which is the

741
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:19,770
gray part on the top right part of the

742
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,779
this methanol pathway and we would need

743
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,950
to put in even more water and split it

744
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,160
at the beginning because some of the

745
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:29,189
water for sure ends up in our product

746
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,170
that's why we are doing that so we would

747
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:36,480
need to put in a whole lot of water to

748
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:40,140
make that and we would have massive mass

749
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,720
flow so we would have a by many factors

750
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,089
or by a huge factor larger chemical

751
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,390
industry if we would do that because we

752
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,130
would also need

753
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:53,109
plans to capture the carbon dioxide and

754
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:56,740
so on and so on and now the exact same

755
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:59,680
question does that make sense and here

756
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,868
is two models so I showed you the high

757
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,720
TRL model which is again technology

758
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:06,849
readiness level so can we do it today or

759
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,538
is it something we could do maybe in

760
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:14,950
future and the orange area is the we can

761
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:17,170
we can maybe do that today area and it's

762
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,839
the same graph plus as I shown you in

763
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,690
the in the electricity part or in the

764
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,058
sorry in the energy part just the other

765
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:28,930
way around like zero that x on the on

766
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:31,920
the right side and we see like again we

767
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:34,990
would need to have a whole lot of

768
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:42,640
renewable electricity which is really

769
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:46,209
clean not not a grid mix from today yeah

770
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,879
now we can come to another graphics like

771
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,690
how much electricity would we need to do

772
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,029
that and this graph shows like the

773
00:38:52,690 --> 00:39:00,759
different lines the colored lines are

774
00:38:55,029 --> 00:39:03,640
different global warming impacts of the

775
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:08,259
electricity are put in so 0 would be the

776
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:10,808
best thinkable so I have zero emission

777
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:13,539
electricity I put in so I go down that

778
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:16,480
line and it's drawn of the additional

779
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:18,789
electricity we need so how much do we

780
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,750
need to install extra to what we have

781
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:24,700
today and on the sides the scales is

782
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,390
cradle to grave greenhouse emissions

783
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,069
which is from my side the meaningful

784
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,920
thing because that says like how much

785
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:35,109
greenhouse gases do I emit from

786
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,119
producing the the chemical till

787
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:39,759
degrading or burning it at the end of

788
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,099
their life so how much extra co2 comes

789
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:44,769
out and the other side is craddle to

790
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:50,980
gate which is more interesting for a

791
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:51,939
company like i takes you to and make

792
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,049
something with it

793
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:58,900
how much do i produce from starting to

794
00:39:56,049 --> 00:40:00,190
my factory gate where i ship the product

795
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,210
and that's also why

796
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:06,940
crowd - gate emissions can be negative

797
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,580
so we can store co2 there and they

798
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,300
cannot be negative when we're looking at

799
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,710
cradle-to-grave

800
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,860
at least not if we're burning the

801
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:18,970
product in the end of the lifetime and

802
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:21,820
we see we need a lot of electricity the

803
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:25,419
the scale down there is in petawatt

804
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:27,730
hours and just to give you a number the

805
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,230
today's generation of electricity in

806
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,070
total so a lot renewable electricity

807
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:35,470
electricity in total is something like

808
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:38,110
24 petawatt hours so we would

809
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:43,020
essentially need the same amount of

810
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:46,330
electricity as we are producing today to

811
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,730
produce the chemicals in future in a

812
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,910
renewable way keeping in mind that we

813
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:57,460
also need the renewable electricity to

814
00:40:51,910 --> 00:41:01,089
make to make heat and mobility and there

815
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:03,490
is the point where I say like there is

816
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:11,560
this is nice technology and we can do a

817
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:14,830
lot with that but the question is so

818
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:18,820
from my point of view we cannot reach

819
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:21,190
that so we need definitely to reduce so

820
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,600
we need to reduce in all the ways we

821
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:25,930
need to reduce chemicals we need to

822
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,000
reduce all kinds of energy usage and

823
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:31,569
that on a severe level because we just

824
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,540
don't have enough energy to make that or

825
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:36,850
we are not from my perspective not able

826
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:40,090
to produce in a sufficient time scale

827
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:44,589
enough electricity to do so but we could

828
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:47,470
still do something and keep our like

829
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:50,320
luxury level at least at some level for

830
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:52,779
the next time and the next generations

831
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,790
and at the end I would just want to show

832
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,180
you very briefly where I think this

833
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:01,720
energy might come from and I want to

834
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:04,270
show you that map and this map is

835
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,859
basically the sun shining on the earth

836
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:12,040
like the in in what per square meter is

837
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,050
that that colored scale and there's a

838
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,730
reason there's two reasons why a

839
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,280
put that map the way you see at first

840
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,900
because it's anyway useful to change

841
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,580
perspective from time to time and not be

842
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,240
in the center of the world

843
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:28,240
and the other thing is that today it's

844
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,450
very often that the southern hemisphere

845
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,640
depends on the northern hemisphere for a

846
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,500
lot of reasons but in that case we

847
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,020
depend on the southern hemisphere and we

848
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:42,220
want to make that in a social and fair

849
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:44,290
way and not in a new colonial way we

850
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,350
essentially need to go to them and ask

851
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:49,630
them would you please generate energy

852
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:53,020
carrying products for us because we need

853
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:55,420
them other ways wise our society will

854
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,310
break apart cause this drop in luxury we

855
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:02,260
can't just can't afford for our saya tee

856
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:05,230
a society and what I would do in in in

857
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:08,830
large scale is putting their down their

858
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:11,290
concentrated solar power plants which

859
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,080
are really able to produce very high

860
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:19,270
amounts of electricity in a fairly easy

861
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,430
way on small small scale and we can

862
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:24,790
produce like all day and night if you

863
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:28,509
because you can store the heat in in the

864
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:30,340
in the liquid salt and you could place

865
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,660
like plants there which produce for

866
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:38,680
example methanol and ship it to us like

867
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:41,830
yeah in in that way and yeah with that I

868
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,700
think I have some few minutes left but

869
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:49,029
I'm already at the end of the talk and I

870
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:52,000
thank you for your kind attention but

871
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,120
for the questions I want to just start

872
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,890
something you see the source here

873
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,460
climate clock clock dotnet to just show

874
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:02,650
you how severe the discussion is yeah

875
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,430
and with that again thank you for your

876
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:09,210
attention and I'm happy to try to answer

877
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,210
your questions

878
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:19,970
all right since there's a longer break

879
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,410
after this talk we can take a couple of

880
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,060
questions so if you have a question for

881
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,790
Jonas please come to one of the two

882
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:29,060
microphones in the room and ask a brief

883
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,980
and concise question so we can be quick

884
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:44,000
about it but maybe there are actually no

885
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:47,000
questions or maybe one yeah all right

886
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,970
great talk how are we gonna capture all

887
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,890
the co2 because that's infrastructure

888
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:58,339
isn't there yet there is infrastructure

889
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:00,850
is not there but the technology is there

890
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:04,130
especially when concerning point sources

891
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:06,380
like going to some factory which

892
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:09,080
produces YouTube that we need to keep in

893
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:11,720
mind that deal between renewable

894
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,790
electricity like what is the footprint

895
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,379
of our electricity and what are we

896
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:18,110
producing but we have some processes

897
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:20,350
like for example concrete production

898
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:23,150
where inherently in the process we are

899
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:25,910
producing co2 that could be one option

900
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:27,680
and there are some startups around the

901
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:30,290
world who are making direct air capture

902
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,410
and who are quite efficiently especially

903
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:36,110
if they have a heat source or wait here

904
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:38,540
a waste heat source around they can very

905
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:41,450
efficiently capture already today very

906
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:44,120
pure co2 from from ambient air around us

907
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:47,569
so the technology is there the

908
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,220
infrastructure is not all right then

909
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,470
we're just gonna take that last question

910
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,750
please you mentioned that we need about

911
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:56,209
the same amount of electrical energy

912
00:45:53,750 --> 00:46:00,260
that we have today for this power to X

913
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:04,780
so what amount of power of electricity

914
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:07,100
do we have renewable installed today I

915
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:11,120
actually have no idea about the

916
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,830
worldwide installed electricity I know

917
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,720
that we are in Germany where we always

918
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,700
say we were very good but we actually

919
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,040
are not like our footprint something

920
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:22,250
around 450 if you remember the scale

921
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,009
before that's on the far outside and of

922
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,850
these graphs in like the intermediate

923
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,850
value over the year

924
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,269
yeah I think there there is one page I

925
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:35,730
can recommend to you

926
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:37,979
electricity map where they collect data

927
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,480
like this and you can see like how green

928
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,299
is the electricity in different

929
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,440
countries but yeah basically I don't

930
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,210
know I know that the Chinese are

931
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,769
producing a whole lot of renewable

932
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,829
energies even if they are still building

933
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:53,939
coal plants but they are really going on

934
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:58,829
on with that so it's getting better but

935
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:00,359
it's still way too slow now alright

936
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:02,039
thank you so much for taking the

937
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:05,009
questions thanks for the great talk and

938
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:06,030
that concludes our Q&A session takes

939
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:20,119
Jonas

940
