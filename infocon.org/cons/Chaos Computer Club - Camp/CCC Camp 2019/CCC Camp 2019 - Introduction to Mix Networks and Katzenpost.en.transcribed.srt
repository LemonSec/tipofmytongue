1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:18,330
[Music]

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,480
is from two lovely gentlemen Dave and

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,328
Leif in the Far plan you might have seen

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,570
Moe but that changed so we have this

5
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:29,550
talk by David Stanton and Leif and the

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,710
title is introduction to mixed networks

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,649
and cuts and posts and this is about a

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,840
new and the new movement and how - yeah

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,879
how mix networks actually work I have no

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:53,420
clue so I'm thrilled hopefully you are

11
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:56,010
as well and here are Leif and Dave okay

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,719
I'm gonna give a brief introduction

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,789
David has a lot to say about mix nets

14
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,999
I'm gonna talk more generally about

15
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,750
anonymous communication first to sort of

16
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:08,580
give some context and the first question

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,510
I want to ask and answer is what does a

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,610
what does the word anonymous really mean

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,280
if we look at Wiktionary of course the

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,159
good source of truth here it shows us

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,659
that anonymous means without a name and

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,100
has a few different definitions there

23
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,399
none of these really apply to privacy

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,740
enhancing technologies anonymous

25
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:33,299
communication technologies the closest

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,630
thing in this definition is actually

27
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,990
about Wikipedia which is it says

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,329
anonymous contributors of Wikipedia so

29
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,369
that it's on Wikipedia that are not

30
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,250
logged in are often called anonymous

31
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,310
edits now they call them IP edits which

32
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,079
is more accurate but a lot of people

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,810
still call them anonymous edits and

34
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
those edits are much worse for privacy

35
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,189
in a lot of regards than if you were to

36
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,590
log into Wikipedia you could have

37
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,869
multiple pseudonyms and if you do that

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,640
then your edits are not linkable to each

39
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:16,320
other I'll talk more about in a moment

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:18,629
um so Oh wrong computer this is an

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,010
interesting project you can find on

42
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,179
github

43
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,220
at github.com /e d su / an on the tracks

44
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,170
so-called anonymous edits on Wikipedia

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,609
and identifies who's doing them and

46
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,559
there's a thing called Congress edits

47
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,269
which showed that it's made by people in

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:44,610
the US Congress and lots of other places

49
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:47,400
as well so if let's see so when people

50
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,159
talk about anonymity in the context of

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,500
privacy enhancing technologies they're

52
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,980
really usually talking about unlink

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,440
ability in some form which is a lot more

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,858
precise but still too vague because it

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,840
doesn't define what is unlikable to WHO

56
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:07,139
in the literature you can find a lot of

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,299
more specific concepts like a sender

58
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,269
anonymity receiver anonymity location

59
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:16,260
and anima teather party anonymity these

60
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:18,299
are all about preventing people from

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,670
linking who is talking to who or who

62
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,530
sent a message then there's some more

63
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,480
interesting properties like sender

64
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,690
unobservable 'ti and receiver

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,790
unobservable 'ti which is to avoid

66
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,230
having somebody be able to observe that

67
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,470
a user has sent a message at all

68
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,168
regardless of who it's - all of these

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,090
are about making event son linkable from

70
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:43,739
the perspective of some adversaries with

71
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,489
specific capabilities so we talked about

72
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,319
those capabilities in threat models and

73
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:53,220
threat model should define adversary

74
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:57,168
capabilities and say what what a given

75
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,519
tool is trying to protect against

76
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:01,500
sometimes they're not well-defined and

77
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,930
sometimes they are very well defined but

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,690
they're not well understood by the users

79
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,849
that rely on the software I think when

80
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,280
looking at threat models it's useful to

81
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,709
invert them instead of thinking about

82
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,150
the adversaries that it is protecting

83
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,820
against consider the ones that it

84
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,228
doesn't protect against so if you have

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,389
an example if somebody is editing

86
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,938
Wikipedia they post a

87
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:27,030
and that somebody doesn't like who can

88
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,800
tell who can link that edit to another

89
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,830
edit that the user has made or link it

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,479
to an IP address there's a couple

91
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,000
different adversaries that clearly can

92
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,500
there's the operators of Wikipedia and

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,129
there is people who are able to observe

94
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,020
the users traffic to the site Wikipedia

95
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,879
is encrypted of course but if somebody

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,219
at your ISP or say say you make is edit

97
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,849
from work and it's about your company

98
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:51,900
and they're looking at the does edit

99
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,128
they don't like it they wonder if

100
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,679
somebody the company did it they

101
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:58,319
couldn't see who if they have NetFlow

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,599
data that records the all the TCP

103
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,400
connections they can see who who sent

104
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:05,789
that amount of data to Wikipedia at that

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,938
time and they can clearly say this user

106
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:10,620
probably made that edit so those are

107
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,139
those are two very different adversaries

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,699
the site admin and anybody able to

109
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,639
observe the user can do that because

110
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,689
they can see the other end as well

111
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,639
because that's public if you're making a

112
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,490
public post also anybody who could

113
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,409
compromise one of those two groups the

114
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,839
site admins or somebody can observe the

115
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:34,979
user so most well-known inanimate etool

116
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:38,909
today is tor which I'm sure everybody

117
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,710
here has probably heard of there's

118
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,810
pictures like this that show how tor

119
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,489
works there's actually layers of

120
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,500
encryption on each of those green lines

121
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:52,529
so David made another picture here that

122
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:54,449
shows the layers of encryption the so

123
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:57,779
you you pick a path through the Tor

124
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,819
network and you connect to the first top

125
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,039
there the entry guard and extend to the

126
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,080
middle and extend to the exit and the

127
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,699
middle can only see the traffic's coming

128
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,620
from the entry and going to the exit it

129
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,080
doesn't know the the client or the

130
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,939
destination and likewise the entry guard

131
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,419
knows about the client in the middle but

132
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,849
not the exit or the destination so

133
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:23,060
towards threat model is somewhat well

134
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:26,610
known is there 2004 USENIX paper oops

135
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,940
yeah this is the first paragraph of the

136
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,580
Tor threat model

137
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,940
which says that a global passive

138
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,469
adversary is the most commonly assumed

139
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,300
threat when analyzing theoretical and

140
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,210
enmity designs which at the time this

141
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,270
was written mixed knits were something

142
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,049
that we're being researched a lot and

143
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,210
the the Tor network was very new then

144
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,510
and they say instead of trying to

145
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:55,719
protect against that where we're going

146
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,860
to try to achieve more by having a lower

147
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,120
latency system we'll talk about the

148
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,910
properties of mixed Nets and why they

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,220
why they made these these trade-offs a

150
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,280
global passive adversary at the time was

151
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,600
considered to be pretty unlikely it was

152
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,369
kind of a theoretical thing of course

153
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,800
today we know that there are entities

154
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,780
that observe all traffic passing by lots

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,240
of different points on around the world

156
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,299
and they're not even just passive they

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,190
do active attacks as well and

158
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,540
unfortunately there isn't a general

159
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,020
purpose anonymity system that's designed

160
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:29,170
to protect against those sort of

161
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,090
adversaries still today but even worse

162
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:35,290
than that there's much weaker

163
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,969
adversaries they can also often do what

164
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,560
tor is trying to prevent them from doing

165
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,320
the the second paragraph of the threat

166
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,150
model explains that actually it's not

167
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,010
just global passive adversaries but

168
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,659
people who can just see both ends of the

169
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,060
connection they could confirm that

170
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,270
that's happening in the case of like

171
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,710
posting a public message that's and

172
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,240
everybody can see one end of the

173
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,960
connection you can see when a blog

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,240
comment was posted or when a wikipedia

175
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,370
and it was made or so on so going back

176
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,770
to the example earlier with those two

177
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,360
different adversaries the site admins or

178
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,760
somebody who's monitoring your traffic

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,000
like your ISP or somebody on the Wi-Fi

180
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,250
your employer at university they could

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,890
actually in some scenarios still tell

182
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,290
who made that comment on a blog even if

183
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,510
you're using tor even if they don't

184
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,790
observe anything except for your

185
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,690
connection if you have a local adversary

186
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:32,740
at your university of your employer so

187
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:35,200
that's not that's not great so am i

188
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,159
saying like we shouldn't use tor Oh

189
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,110
actually there was supposed to be

190
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,260
another slide in here that said why use

191
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,909
tor and

192
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,549
I've got a lot of reasons why I still

193
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,290
use tor even though it's not got the

194
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,260
strongest threat model and I recommend

195
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,750
people use it for lots of things

196
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,150
the reasons are they did it provides a

197
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,590
location in anima T from sites if they

198
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,050
aren't observing your network connection

199
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,730
it provides some browsing privacy from

200
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,859
adversaries that do observe your local

201
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,950
connection if they aren't observing the

202
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,260
site's a single hop VPN could do both

203
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,250
those things but it's much weaker

204
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,530
because the anonymity said is much

205
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,000
smaller and the the VPN is a single

206
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,150
point of failure it could be observed

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,530
and see all of your source and

208
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,709
destinations link them all together

209
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:23,329
regardless of where you travel to so

210
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,680
linked or is it's not able to defend

211
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,390
against somebody that sees both ends of

212
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,199
the connection but it is a lot better

213
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:33,140
than any other alternative for a general

214
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,790
purpose anonymity system the tor browser

215
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,530
also has some great anti tracking

216
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,349
features and there's hidden services

217
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,569
towards great I don't want to sound like

218
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm saying otherwise it's just we'd like

219
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:48,140
to have something stronger

220
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:52,370
and so that's mix networks mix networks

221
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:55,610
were proposed I think maybe in 1979 even

222
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,560
the paper about it came out in 1981 this

223
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,380
is the first paragraph of David Tom's

224
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,109
paper untraceable electronic mail return

225
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:10,910
addresses and digital pseudonyms from

226
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:12,740
1981 so how do mix nets work they're

227
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,209
kind of like tor they have the layers of

228
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,670
encryption but there's a big difference

229
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,800
which is that they are reordering the

230
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,689
messages all the messages are fixed

231
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,319
sized so we have four messages they're

232
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,450
going into a mix inside the mix we don't

233
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,070
see what happens for an external

234
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,220
observer there's a layer of encryption

235
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,860
that's removed and new messages come out

236
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,700
in a different order that are bitwise

237
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,470
done linkable from the inputs the mix of

238
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,470
course can link them so you actually

239
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,630
want to have more than one mix you could

240
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,290
think about the whole mix network as a

241
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,930
single mix logically though so messages

242
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:55,120
go in and as

243
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:57,810
and you can't explain that so I guess

244
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,950
I'm gonna turn it over to David here

245
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,949
[Music]

246
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,910
okay so Leif mentioned the threshold

247
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,520
mixed strategy I didn't actually know

248
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,920
well the threshold mixed strategy say we

249
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,199
have a threshold set before this so this

250
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,370
mix wouldn't send any messages until

251
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,870
accumulated four messages and so that

252
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,050
means that these output messages have a

253
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,580
25% chance of being linked with one of

254
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,010
the input messages which is a pretty

255
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,680
weak security margin so if we were going

256
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,390
to use this in a public deployment in

257
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,400
the real world scenario we would want to

258
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,550
set the threshold to like 10,000 or

259
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,290
million we can also use what are called

260
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:43,180
continuous time mixed strategies which

261
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:46,540
don't have concrete

262
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,790
bounding on the anonymity set size for

263
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,709
example we're gonna talk about captain

264
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,420
post he uses the Poisson mix strategy

265
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,730
which was first published in the loop

266
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,530
picks paper and it's continuous time mix

267
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,950
so messages come in and out of the mix

268
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:04,300
at random times and users set the delay

269
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:08,430
to a random delay so continuous time

270
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,430
mixed strategies you in this case would

271
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,270
well I mean so let's let's let's talk

272
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,120
about the architecture you have to get

273
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,800
the public key material of all the mixes

274
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,400
to be able to send a nested encrypted

275
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:26,109
packet through the mix network so mixed

276
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:31,120
minion Oh which was a project before tor

277
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:33,490
project they they used the pool mix and

278
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,560
they had a PKI system similar to torso

279
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,100
Katzen post uses a directory authority

280
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,709
system similar to tor and mix minion but

281
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,930
we plan in the future to to improve its

282
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,550
design right now it's not Byzantine

283
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,969
fault tolerant but it is slightly

284
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,949
decentralized in its voting protocol so

285
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,720
once clients gain access to all the

286
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,310
connectivity information all the key

287
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
material they can send these nested

288
00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:01,689
encrypted packets through the mix

289
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,390
network okay so this is a great paper

290
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,560
that discusses and

291
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,870
strategies so there's many different

292
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,140
trade-offs for mik strategies there's

293
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,210
performance and anonymity trade-offs and

294
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,010
this paper takes a functional look at

295
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,560
the different trade-offs for various mix

296
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,530
strategies but one thing they all have

297
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,390
in common is they all add latency and so

298
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:25,770
the tour whereas tour tries to route met

299
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,080
messages through the network as quickly

300
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,910
as possible and actually may that might

301
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,590
not be the most accurate way to say it

302
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:39,060
because tour actually routes cells which

303
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:41,310
are pieces of a stream so so I want to

304
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,310
discuss some attacks and some defenses

305
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,069
and we have a lot to cover and I thought

306
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,079
I would do it by talking real fast

307
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:53,070
that's kind of a talking strategy to get

308
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,180
all the information in here so but most

309
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,970
of the attacks we're going to talk today

310
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,650
are about all communication networks

311
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,840
they don't just apply to mix networks

312
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,850
all these attacks applied to tor and

313
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,060
other and in enmity systems as well so

314
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,040
it's it's it's pretty useful but this n

315
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,589
minus-1 attack is really specific to mix

316
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,140
networks and to briefly describe it if

317
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,480
we have this threshold mix and the

318
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,370
adversary si controls some routers

319
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,470
upstream or downstream but they don't

320
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,940
control the mix itself if they see the

321
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,380
target message enter the mix they can

322
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,850
always just send their own messages into

323
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,740
the mix and make sure it hits its

324
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,290
threshold so the messages are shuffled

325
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,730
and sent out and they know what their

326
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,120
own messages will look like coming out

327
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,440
but so the one message they don't they

328
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,910
don't recognize this obviously the

329
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,890
target message so they've just traced

330
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,540
the message through one hop through the

331
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,640
network and this attack would have to be

332
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,680
repeated through all the hops and the

333
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,410
route in order to completely compromised

334
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,829
the unlinking between sender and

335
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,300
receiver so that's one one example of an

336
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,310
attack and it's called an n minus one

337
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,870
attack but there's many variations on

338
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,609
this attack and this is a pretty good

339
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,430
paper to read to get a kind of overview

340
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:04,020
on how to apply it to different types of

341
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:05,489
mixed strategies so on your Patronus may

342
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,329
not be behind the Olympics and in MIDI

343
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:12,270
system Katzen post is based on a lot of

344
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:15,270
the design from her paper so which

345
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,750
includes the Poisson mixed strategy this

346
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:21,329
this idea that we can make decoy traffic

347
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,040
trade-off with latency so we can make

348
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,260
the latency a bit lower if we're willing

349
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,500
to exchange some bandwidth overhead and

350
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,060
send decoy messages but there's a good

351
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,980
interrupt for a moment something that I

352
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,430
neglected to say here was it the

353
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:39,990
original mix net projects that were

354
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:42,150
deployed in the late 90s early 2000s had

355
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,220
extremely high latency Xand were sending

356
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,319
email only which made them not very

357
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,020
useful and thus not a very big anonymity

358
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,900
set and the Renaissance of mix net

359
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,660
research in the last decade or so maybe

360
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,910
a little more than a decade has sort of

361
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,370
arrived at thinking that maybe we could

362
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,810
actually have much lower latency while

363
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,040
still having very strong anonymity so

364
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,030
that's a where where the work is today

365
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,110
yeah did you want to mention the

366
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,630
anonymity trilemma

367
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,160
i think you have that later but yeah

368
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,850
there's a there's this paper about the

369
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,110
the anonymity trilemma which there's a

370
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,760
big oversimplification of it says

371
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,770
there's three things you'd like really

372
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,490
strong in a mini low latency and low

373
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,319
bandwidth overhead and tor is kind of on

374
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,020
the low bandwidth overhead low latency

375
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,920
side so the anonymity is not as strong

376
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,540
and the new thinking is that you could

377
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,110
have a bit more bandwidth overhead of

378
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,150
sending a lot of cover traffic and have

379
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:44,670
reasonably low latency still with much

380
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:48,840
stronger anonymity yeah so the - so in

381
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:50,819
in the Olympics model we let's see let's

382
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,820
not talk about n minus-1 attacks for Poe

383
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,220
sonic strategy in this talk so there's

384
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,110
various types of Cascade various types

385
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,940
of topologies for mixed nets and David

386
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,000
Toms first paper published in 1981

387
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,040
covers this cascade topology but one

388
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,109
interesting thing difference between tor

389
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,420
and mix Nets is tor has to have lots of

390
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,669
relays and you have to have many a big

391
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,220
route permutation space right because

392
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,540
you want route unpredictability so that

393
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,699
your adversaries can't predict your

394
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,839
route and for mixed nuts we just don't

395
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,400
need route unpredictability

396
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,550
everyone could be routing through the

397
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,830
same four hops and it would work fine

398
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,419
except it wouldn't scale so you need

399
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,580
more so it can scale but if there's four

400
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,020
hops you could still provide

401
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,659
strong yen and Rudy for however many

402
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,889
users they have capacity for yeah so it

403
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,010
doesn't scale it doesn't have high

404
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,540
availability and so 10 years ago or so

405
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,629
people thought that free route was a

406
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,430
good alternative to cascade because you

407
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,520
at least have high availability if one

408
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,080
of these notes in the network it has an

409
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,650
outage you can route around it the free

410
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,270
route is a topology where any you can

411
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,060
make a path that goes from any relay to

412
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,800
any other relay you can completely pick

413
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,610
your path freely and it's free route

414
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:04,649
yeah so one of one so one of the

415
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,449
downsides is that actually if alice is

416
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,860
sending message to Bob and and Bob is

417
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,050
sending message to Alice and using the

418
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,959
same three relays but in a different

419
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,669
order if the message is they're going to

420
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,610
intersect on one of these mixes and when

421
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,110
they do the source of the message will

422
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,449
be a distinguishing characteristic so

423
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,429
the message won't actually be mixed but

424
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,620
what we mean to say is that the

425
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,880
anonymity sets on the mixes will be

426
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,780
split and there'll be smaller sets so

427
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,060
smaller security margin and the so these

428
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,830
academics came up with the stratified

429
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:42,149
topology also known as the layered

430
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:45,270
topology and so here we have a diagram

431
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,190
with three layers layer one layer two

432
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,610
layer three and they can only send to

433
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,350
the next layer to the right and in the

434
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,990
end captain post and in lieu picks we

435
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,929
have providers at the beginning and end

436
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,690
of the route providers are a superset of

437
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,850
a mix they allows message queuing for

438
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,530
later retrieval and network services

439
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:09,179
that you can interact with and so but

440
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,950
there's there's other approaches as well

441
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,780
if you think about it if there was a

442
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,490
compromised mix on each each of these

443
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,840
layers then the more messages you send

444
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,760
you would you would choose a new route

445
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,350
for every message you send and so you

446
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,540
would be increasing the probability of

447
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,790
eventually choosing a bad route so in

448
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,040
our threat model a bad route is defined

449
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,990
to be a route in which every mix in your

450
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,200
entire route is compromised then it's

451
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,880
game over right so if we have one honest

452
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,940
mix in your route you still have this

453
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,910
unlinking property between input and

454
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,130
output messages so if

455
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:48,340
we could instead another approach to

456
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:52,080
dealing with that sort of compulsion

457
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,550
attack threat model is to is to have

458
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,490
various cascades be distributed by the

459
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:02,260
PGI so clients can choose whichever one

460
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:04,660
they want so when you allow clients to

461
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,660
choose routes though you you need to

462
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,290
make them not distinguishable

463
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,820
characteristic for that one client

464
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,850
otherwise there could be fingerprinting

465
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,590
attacks so this is why a gossip protocol

466
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,020
is probably not good to distribute

467
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,510
information about the network this is

468
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,490
why we have a PCI that distributes the

469
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,620
consensus document that covers the

470
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,240
entire network to all the users so that

471
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,909
everybody has uniform knowledge about

472
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,980
the current state of the network and one

473
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,570
users choices about their path selection

474
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,640
will be indistinguishable from other

475
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,590
users yeah and this not only applies to

476
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,540
mixed Nets but it applies to tour and

477
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,970
i2p and all anonymous communication

478
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,040
systems have the potential to have route

479
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,620
fingerprinting attacks which we would

480
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,399
like to avoid but I feel like the most

481
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,229
important attack category that that we

482
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,420
want to protect against is statistical

483
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,460
disclosure attacks and all types of

484
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,840
discos statistical disclosure attacks

485
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,900
are important to have some defense

486
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,419
against but mainly we are trying to

487
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:04,660
provide partial defense against long

488
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,370
term intersection attacks so we can

489
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,350
extract away the entire mixed network as

490
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,719
if it's a single mix a single router

491
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,209
where there's some input messages and

492
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,660
some output messages so if for example

493
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,210
Alice 1 goes offline Bob 1 and two might

494
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,760
be observed to receive 20% fewer

495
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,470
messages so if that's the case it's it's

496
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,629
now obvious that some metadata was

497
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,880
leaked right Alice one was previously

498
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,720
sending the messages when she was online

499
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,390
so this statistical disclosure attack

500
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,310
applies to all communication systems and

501
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,820
so all our communication systems leak

502
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,470
some amount of metadata an expanded

503
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,419
version of this diagram is this

504
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,510
so if clients are receiving messages

505
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,940
directly from the mix network then a

506
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,290
passive adversary on the right the

507
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,700
vertical line represents a part of the

508
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,050
network they're viewing right they can

509
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,640
see all the clients send messages into

510
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,320
the network and all the messages come

511
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,830
out and they can

512
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,259
make these long term statistical just

513
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:05,730
predictions or sort of assumptions about

514
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:08,559
which client is talking to who and

515
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:11,139
however if we replace the edge of the

516
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,080
network with providers that have many

517
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:15,459
queues for each client then this status

518
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,070
quo information that's leaking here on

519
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:22,000
the right is a lot less specific about

520
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:25,389
which client so if each provider has say

521
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,570
10,000 message queues for like 10,000

522
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:30,729
other users then then this would be

523
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,590
leaking a lot less information

524
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,870
so captain post also has clients

525
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,928
retrieve messages later from providers

526
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,639
and they use a traffic padded protocol

527
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:41,100
to do so so each of these clients

528
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:43,928
receives the same amount of information

529
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,449
jean-paul in this example he has one

530
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,610
message in his queue and it's

531
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:52,480
indistinguishable from the other

532
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,769
messages from the other retrievals so so

533
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,090
that's a little bit about statistical

534
00:22:53,769 --> 00:23:00,700
disclosure taxes were actually a lot of

535
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:03,820
literature about it and so we use this

536
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,620
Fink's packet format it's specifically

537
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,990
designed for decryption mixed networks

538
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,768
but it has also been used in the design

539
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:14,649
of low latency systems like Hornet

540
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:16,330
so Fink's was designed as a drop-in

541
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,820
replacement for the packet format and

542
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,960
mix minion and never was deployed as

543
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:25,928
such we have a slightly modern version

544
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,909
of it and Katzen post where we use newer

545
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:32,950
cryptographic primitives and I don't

546
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,710
have time to talk about all the details

547
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,860
but basically since we don't have an

548
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,990
interactive bi-directional communication

549
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,289
channel we're using these Fink's packets

550
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:47,919
that are being transformed as they

551
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:51,669
traverse the network they we don't have

552
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,470
forward secrecy properties so we are

553
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:55,360
more vulnerable to compulsion attacks

554
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,879
actually this is interesting because tor

555
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,110
is in this one particular threat model

556
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:04,120
tor is a bit safer than mix networks so

557
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:06,250
when we talk about overlay networks we

558
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,539
usually refer to the wire protocol that

559
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,580
you're actually talking to the machines

560
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:10,040
over as a link layer right this is

561
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,899
connecting

562
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,690
the clients the mixes in the mixes to

563
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,750
the other mixes and in tour they use TLS

564
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,320
and in our mix Network we use a noise

565
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,460
based cryptographic protocol and if we

566
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,649
just ignore that we have this

567
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,420
cryptographic link layer for a minute if

568
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,520
you were to grab some tor cypher text

569
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,400
from like an nth or handshake and you

570
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,379
wanted to get the police to compel

571
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,150
legally compel a tor relay operator to

572
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,010
decrypt it so you can find out where the

573
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,110
next hop is if you were to try to do

574
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,240
that with tor it would be difficult to

575
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,729
make such an attack successful since you

576
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,670
have these ephemeral keys being

577
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:52,370
destroyed every few minutes by every hop

578
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:54,140
in in the circuit and in mixed networks

579
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,479
there is some opportunity to perform

580
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,330
these attacks with legal action police

581
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,930
raids or just compromising the mix to

582
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,240
clarify a little bit of what the

583
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,940
compulsion attack here is is possible

584
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,770
because mixes have to use a fixed key

585
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,570
you don't set up a session like in tour

586
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,940
where you create a stream you extend to

587
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,189
you chop so before you actually send

588
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,920
your request through tor your HTTP

589
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:22,400
request or whatever you're sending your

590
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,020
is doing a ephemeral difficult in with

591
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,060
each of the intermediate hops you have

592
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,030
key material that can be thrown away at

593
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:32,360
the end of that stream or that circuit

594
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,129
and in mixed networks you don't have

595
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,459
this state it's each message is an

596
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,470
independent thing so you can't throw

597
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,880
those keys away because you learned them

598
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,560
and you you have to use the keys that

599
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,900
are the current key so instead the keys

600
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,720
are rotated out some key rotation

601
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,130
interval and during that interval this

602
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,500
compulsion attack is possible where

603
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,210
somebody could go through find a message

604
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,220
they want to do naanum eyes and ask each

605
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,900
ops a or tell them tell each op you have

606
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,010
to decrypt this or will kill you or

607
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:04,820
something so that's the solution here a

608
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:06,860
sure is the main defense we have in 2002

609
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,169
Georg published a paper forward secure

610
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,270
mixes where the you can interact with

611
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,250
the specific mix key which is destroyed

612
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,770
immediately after your packet traverses

613
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,500
that route however you're leaking extra

614
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,480
metadata to that mix so you're saying

615
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,610
I'm the same entity as last time that

616
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,420
interacted with you and now I'm doing it

617
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,340
again and you're

618
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,560
destroying the key for me thanks so this

619
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,360
is kind of a trade-off because on the

620
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,010
one hand you're leaking extra metadata

621
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,740
to this one mix on the other hand it

622
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,870
destroys the key sooner in Katzen post

623
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,850
currently with the key rotation

624
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,699
schedules to set to three hours but we

625
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,530
plan to soon set it to much lower maybe

626
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,840
under an hour

627
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,750
and so this is our main defense is key

628
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,970
erasure and there are other partial

629
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,340
defenses against compulsion attacks

630
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,380
here's another paper about it that's

631
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,980
pretty interesting it's got deniable

632
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,260
routing multipath routing steps and and

633
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,540
things like that so I don't want to go

634
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,820
into into any detail about these but I

635
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,980
just want to mention that there are

636
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:12,139
other avenues of thought regarding mixed

637
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:14,690
net design and so Amir Hertzberg is one

638
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,000
of the authors of these two papers and

639
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:20,780
they have a different kind of strategy I

640
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,810
mentioned the multi cascade topology

641
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,240
before and so it's it's somewhat related

642
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,399
to the compulsion attack in in the sense

643
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,660
that like I mentioned before if you send

644
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,590
your messages through the Mex network

645
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,180
with a new route with for each hop you

646
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,399
don't want to necessarily increase the

647
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,930
probability of choosing a bad route so

648
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,190
you could use one route for a while and

649
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:48,710
then switch your route and make so rmx

650
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,290
networks an overlay network and so what

651
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,960
we mean by that is we're using we're

652
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:57,530
using IP right we're using ipv4 we're

653
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,600
using TCP and we're sent we're adding

654
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,060
some protocol layers on top of that so

655
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,740
we can have a custom automatic repeat

656
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,899
request error correction scheme to

657
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,520
retransmit messages if they get lost in

658
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:14,540
the mix Network and things things like

659
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:17,720
that and so Trevor Perrin helped us a

660
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,940
bit yawning angel designed the our wire

661
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,060
protocol it's based on the noise

662
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,640
cryptographic protocol framework peter

663
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:28,610
suavo also was very helpful in

664
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,120
communicating about new hope' simple and

665
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:34,929
khyber and was involved in creating the

666
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,790
post quantum key encapsulation

667
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,770
mechanisms that we use

668
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,840
we have a post quantum cryptographic

669
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,760
link layer which i think is pretty cool

670
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:48,100
thanks to Yanni angel and these other

671
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,870
people and so so this is the anonymity

672
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,580
trilemma we mentioned before there's

673
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,800
this trade-off inherent trade-off

674
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,800
between latency bandwidth and the

675
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,560
strength of anonymity that is offered by

676
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,629
the system so in in the I just want to

677
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,550
mention the in the Katzen post or in the

678
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:07,060
loop it's design in general using these

679
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:10,419
Poisson mix strategy on the mixes

680
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:13,120
clients aggregate several Poisson

681
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,940
processes at the inn and they send out

682
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,489
traffic which has legitimate traffic

683
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,980
mixed with decode messages and the

684
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,460
reason they do this is so that you can

685
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,350
you can tune the mix network by

686
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,730
modifying parameters in RPI so it's just

687
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:32,709
your booted to all the clients and the

688
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:35,520
clients can set their their traffic to

689
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,780
these parameters and then everyone's

690
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,360
traffic more or less looks the same and

691
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:44,290
there's a kind of trade-off between how

692
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,909
much decoy traffic is sent and and how

693
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,879
much latency is there and then the

694
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:52,360
strength of the anonymity so it so the

695
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,390
tuning problem is so here's an example

696
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,860
of the drop message Alice chooses a

697
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,570
random provider in the network to send

698
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,189
it to and the provider sees that it's a

699
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,320
drop message so it drops it so it's not

700
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,220
fooling an adversary that's on the

701
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,480
destination provider it's it's only

702
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,990
indistinguishable to a passive adversary

703
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,930
watching the network and in this case or

704
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:16,870
so and here's a loop message so a loop

705
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,790
message in Katzen post is sent to this

706
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:22,959
loop service on the destination provider

707
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:24,639
and Alice uses this single single-use

708
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,990
reply block it's a mechanism within the

709
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,180
packet format that allows anonymous

710
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,680
replies so the reply sent to Alice

711
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,780
without the provider knowing Alice's

712
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,980
location on the network I think maybe a

713
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,770
little more should be said on this slide

714
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,650
here of the single-use reply block the

715
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:42,190
light blue line there the reply that's a

716
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,100
route that alice has chosen and sent

717
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,630
that to the provider at the bottom left

718
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,169
so they can't see what the return route

719
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,330
will be Alice picked that and gave them

720
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,700
this serve a single-use reply block

721
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,760
which is sort of like a self-addressed

722
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,070
stamped envelope that says hey this is

723
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,990
how you reply to me and so this this is

724
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,610
the mechanism for anonymous replies but

725
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,160
these are only good for the duration of

726
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,260
the key rotation interval which is this

727
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,490
trade-off about how long you have to do

728
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:12,660
a compulsion attack so Serbs are in

729
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,760
older mix net designs are actually used

730
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:18,060
for human replies but in our current

731
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,980
design

732
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,679
it's a they're they're more for

733
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,350
automatic replies from services where

734
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,720
you're not gonna use the Serbs reply the

735
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,520
next day it's going to be used soon

736
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,340
within the same key rotation interval

737
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,010
right I should also that also reminds me

738
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,949
what leaves that is since we're using

739
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,690
serbs with the poisson mix strategy the

740
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,520
client actually Ellis in this case

741
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,400
chooses the delays all the forward

742
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,920
delays and all the reply delays and so

743
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,480
she actually knows the the rough

744
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,030
estimate of the round-trip time or

745
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
fairly accurate unless there's

746
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,389
computational overhead they each hop or

747
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,600
so but she knows the artificial delay

748
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,040
placed by each mix for the round-trip

749
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,649
which is helpful so that if she doesn't

750
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:05,520
get the reply she knows it was lost in

751
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:10,140
the network and so so there's Litzy

752
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,840
drops loops and lambda p could be a

753
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:17,790
forward message or perhaps the loop if

754
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,639
the queue is empty or so in here we have

755
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,840
another diagram where alice's is

756
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,640
retrieving a message from from a

757
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,530
rendezvous provider so instead of

758
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,270
rendezvous on the provider you directly

759
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,129
connect to you want to exchange messages

760
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,379
using somewhere else on the network

761
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:33,000
because you want some unlink ability

762
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,360
property you want to retrieve your

763
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,970
messages using the mixed network as as

764
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,580
communication transport to retrieve the

765
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,080
messages so I mean it's a fairly simple

766
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,659
design and it's different than the loop

767
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,780
expand the loop picks paper is not

768
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,700
actually presenting us with an anonymous

769
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,870
communication system in the sense that

770
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,130
leaf is talking about where we have

771
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:58,050
location hiding properties here we in

772
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,750
the sense want a kind of mutual distrust

773
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:03,470
property where if if Alice and Bob are

774
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:06,049
talking to each other and if Alice has

775
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,149
she shouldn't learn bops location on the

776
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:11,870
network or if the adversary compromising

777
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:13,370
Alice shouldn't learn pops location and

778
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,120
so they use they can use these

779
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:21,260
intermediaries what I wanted to explain

780
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:23,268
really quickly is that if Alice if

781
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,529
Alice's pre havior is predictable

782
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,600
there's some there's an active

783
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:28,399
confirmation attack so if if she

784
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,500
retrieves a message from this provider

785
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,709
of this rendezvous provider on the

786
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,690
network and it's compromised then the

787
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,820
adversary could make an outage on the

788
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,970
network so that the reply might not ever

789
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:44,299
get to Alice and so if Alice then sends

790
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,950
the reply again it might use the same

791
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:47,269
sequence number or so and so the

792
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,970
adversary just had a positive

793
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:51,470
confirmation that Alice is on a certain

794
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,880
half of the network right because

795
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,460
they've created an outage for half of

796
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,169
the nodes that can receive the reply so

797
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,210
the adversary gets to learn which half

798
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,620
she's on and so if you have some

799
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,809
background in computer science you can

800
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,760
easily see this is this attack would

801
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,428
happen in logarithmic time that's

802
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,918
basically like a binary tree search and

803
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:12,800
so instead we want to randomize the

804
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,199
retransmission delay this might create

805
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,139
usability problems but we can't have

806
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,500
client behavior predictable and so

807
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,540
captain post internally it's a series of

808
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,879
queues connected in a pipeline but

809
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,009
providers can have services and we have

810
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,810
a plugin system so you can have services

811
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,000
to the network so we really want to

812
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:35,000
integrate collaborate with other

813
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,219
developers and and academics as well and

814
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,469
if developers would be interested in

815
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,918
creating new messaging systems we

816
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:45,199
support that we have messaging systems

817
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:47,299
that are usable now on cats and

818
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:52,549
post-book we also want to support making

819
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:55,960
new messaging systems so so it could

820
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,800
also be used to try to transmit

821
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,230
cryptocurrency transactions

822
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,880
obviously because that's just a message

823
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:08,420
and so on yeah the author of flip ik

824
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,000
solver a paper about it and we you would

825
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,619
want other people transmitting their

826
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,089
cryptocurrency transactions you want to

827
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,960
hide it in a crowd of other people doing

828
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,339
the same thing

829
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,250
seeing other services on the same

830
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,910
network wouldn't really create this

831
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,490
end-to-end

832
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,290
unlink ability property you want you're

833
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,629
only really being mixed with the other

834
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:29,490
people in the network so you might be

835
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,190
thinking why does e-cash need this isn't

836
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,720
it already anonymous and z cache the

837
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,819
anonymity that it provides keeps you

838
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,828
from linking transactions together but

839
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:40,349
it doesn't provide the sender

840
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:42,900
unobservable T and that's what the the

841
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,430
mix net can provide so Z cache sort of

842
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,869
like like many things could potentially

843
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,569
have a statistical disclosure attacks

844
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:50,040
against it where you see when somebody

845
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:53,279
sends a message and that's a useful

846
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,950
piece of information and with a if

847
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,210
you're a mix net Z cache client people

848
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,129
can see that you're connected to the

849
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:05,369
network but they couldn't see if you're

850
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:07,290
sending right now okay so what's next if

851
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,609
I think maybe we need to skip some of

852
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:16,160
these slides if we want to have time for

853
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:19,200
questions or no okay right yeah we these

854
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,490
slides are a bit too much detail but

855
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,848
after them I have some paper

856
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:26,040
recommendations hold on let's just skip

857
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,510
all these things you don't need it the

858
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,950
moral character of cryptographic works

859
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,880
by full of rogue away is a really

860
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,799
excellent essay and a we want other

861
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,390
Kotaku furs and computer scientists and

862
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,579
people like that to think more about

863
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,950
helping society and not just for during

864
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,170
their academic careers and and

865
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:47,490
publishing papers that have no meaning

866
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:49,319
so we'd like cryptographers to to

867
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:52,529
collaborate with us and with other

868
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,819
computer scientists and do practical

869
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,880
things that would affect society

870
00:36:53,819 --> 00:37:01,410
positively he mentions charm 81 chomps

871
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:05,160
1981 mix net paper 13 times in this in

872
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,720
in in this paper and it's really what

873
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,549
he's trying to point out is that we

874
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,169
should really think about protecting

875
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:11,790
metadata that's leaked right

876
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,730
cryptographers focus too much on

877
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:17,009
confidentiality or on these zero

878
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,720
knowledge proof systems or whatever

879
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,790
fancy thing they're working on but they

880
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,180
don't focus enough on protecting the

881
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:26,130
metadata that are leaking I also wanted

882
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,790
to mention the authors of the anonymity

883
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,250
trilemma paper

884
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,529
a technical report which is published on

885
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,360
their website and it is called beyond

886
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,610
mixed nets and it talks about hybrid

887
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,680
networks that they're pretty interesting

888
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,900
have some interesting performance

889
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,819
security properties that seem to be

890
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,070
slightly better than mixed networks you

891
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:48,070
can enhance a mix network using a hybrid

892
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:51,880
network scheme by adding secret sharing

893
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:54,420
offline secret sharing and I think this

894
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,720
paper is pretty cool privacy notions

895
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,590
it's pretty interesting it talks about

896
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,109
threat models for anonymous

897
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:04,450
communication networks and what what

898
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:08,800
privacy notions do you expect from these

899
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:13,540
systems and how exactly to to articulate

900
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,880
that so that's our talk is there any

901
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,950
questions um before questions I'll

902
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,400
answer a couple questions I anticipate

903
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,960
is what's the state of the project today

904
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,970
Captain post David and other people have

905
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,040
done a lot of work on it there's code

906
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,959
you can run there's a test network that

907
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,000
is run by David so it's not providing

908
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,290
real anonymity properties it's not a

909
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,150
thing you should start using today

910
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:36,730
unless you want to pack on it and play

911
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:41,350
with it there's a simple text-based

912
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:43,600
client there's a lot of work left to do

913
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,580
but it's being very actively developed

914
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,980
another frequent question is what is

915
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,170
this delay there's lower latency but

916
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,000
still not as low as tor it's it's not

917
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,850
low enough to type in as is HL or

918
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,630
something but I think David really

919
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,460
doesn't like to answer that question

920
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,140
because it has to be tuned and there's a

921
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,820
lot of decisions to make about how low

922
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,609
the latency should be but I think we

923
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,170
could say on on the order of seconds not

924
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,840
minutes

925
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:10,840
is what we're anticipating is gonna be

926
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,570
reasonable the other question I

927
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,420
frequently get is about censorships or

928
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,730
convention and yeah our software works

929
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,830
of Tor onion services and you can use it

930
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:24,180
with tor and use pluggable transports

931
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:29,640
towards got that stuff covered already

932
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,640
thank you for this super interesting job

933
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,480
we do have the some more minutes for

934
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:40,490
questions so there are one microphone

935
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,589
angel up in the front if you'd like to

936
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,328
ask a question which I would like you to

937
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:47,000
do then please serve up to this lovely

938
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:48,799
gentleman and get talking to his

939
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,660
microphone and in the meantime while you

940
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:53,049
do that is there a question from the

941
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,049
internet

942
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:58,819
do you signal angel do you have anything

943
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,799
for us there seems to be not the case

944
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:03,589
therefore please go ahead with your

945
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:06,680
question sure you started by saying that

946
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:09,319
tors threat model is not for a global

947
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,180
passive adversary and it seems that the

948
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:13,700
threat model that captain post and mixed

949
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,779
Nets have does cover that and perhaps go

950
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,609
stronger because you talk about

951
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,010
compulsion attacks but maybe does not go

952
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:21,500
to what we might say is fully a global

953
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,270
active adversary can you surf draw the

954
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,000
line of what you think your threat model

955
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:29,869
Jesus and that boundary so first of all

956
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,829
in the captain post model the receiving

957
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:36,079
side of messages is a provider so if you

958
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:39,140
wanted to do a statistical disclosure

959
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,270
attack with a high amount of statistical

960
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,129
information being leaked it's helpful to

961
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,470
compromise the provider so you can see

962
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,270
which message Q receives messages the

963
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,828
other active attack for make sense that

964
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,180
can think of it's like an n minus one

965
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:52,730
attack where you're attacking the mixed

966
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:56,500
strategy and we have some partial

967
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:00,829
defenses against that but it's kind of

968
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,660
still in it's not a full defense one

969
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:05,569
aspect of the Lumix design is that the

970
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,379
individual mixes are sending loops and

971
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:10,788
so they could potentially detect if

972
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,950
there's an N minus 1 attack happening if

973
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:14,539
messages they send through a certain

974
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,970
relay aren't actually ever making it

975
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:19,010
back to them they can they can see that

976
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,558
that's happening and what to do about

977
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:25,700
that is well kind of an open question

978
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:27,470
but the the PKI operators the the people

979
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,359
the equivalent of tor directory

980
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:33,410
authorities could have some policy

981
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,759
decisions to to say we're not going to

982
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:39,910
use that relay anymore because there is

983
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:42,160
P is facilitating a some sort of attack

984
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,660
yeah I think the

985
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,089
the compulsion attack is the other

986
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,710
active attack right so mixed networks we

987
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:50,140
still get to have these security

988
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,450
properties if we even if we only have

989
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:57,420
one honest hop in our route so that's a

990
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,419
kind of defense by design so to speak

991
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:04,930
please go ahead that's just a quick

992
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:08,230
remark about the fit models that threat

993
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:12,009
models can't be like put in strictly

994
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:15,250
stronger and strictly well weaker which

995
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:19,210
was kind of the question before right

996
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,619
I think if there's anything up but maybe

997
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:24,940
David can say something about that about

998
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:30,190
stronger versus weaker threat models

999
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:33,039
happy also about compulsion attacks that

1000
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,690
Taurus better against okay it's almost

1001
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,000
an unfair comparison because tor is

1002
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,589
easily broken by a much weaker

1003
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,990
adversaries and all these other attacks

1004
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:43,240
it is true it's stronger just for

1005
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,549
compulsion attacks but I think for mixed

1006
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,098
Nets since we can have partial

1007
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:50,380
mitigation we can make the the window of

1008
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:52,630
time very small in which the adversary

1009
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,119
can actually compromise the the key

1010
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:58,240
material and you make use of it so and

1011
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,670
you know another defense against that is

1012
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,660
we can put our mixes in different

1013
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:04,109
continents and different countries

1014
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,538
around the world make the mans really JA

1015
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:10,380
make the man's job really hard right to

1016
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:13,299
trace your your path through the network

1017
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,210
but I think that actually at that point

1018
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:17,440
really does kind of illustrate that you

1019
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,240
can't always say that threat models are

1020
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,269
necessarily stronger or weaker than one

1021
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:31,240
another there can be better or worse in

1022
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:32,439
different different dimensions yes

1023
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,368
please one more question from the

1024
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,140
audience microphone or a remark and just

1025
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,150
to say because the global passive

1026
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,269
addressed adversary there was also some

1027
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:46,450
question about that I mean you can the

1028
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:49,149
active one usually can inject and delay

1029
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,569
and stuff like that because you didn't

1030
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:56,370
quite get on that one

1031
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:59,010
a lot for your remarks David would you

1032
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,690
like to I mean we've pretty much covered

1033
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,600
the active adversary when we talk about

1034
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:06,120
n minus-1 attacks and and compulsion

1035
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,470
attacks I mean there's some other

1036
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,000
attacks that can be done I mean

1037
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,919
certainly we don't have a defense

1038
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,520
against denial of service and things

1039
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:18,090
like that we have partial defense but

1040
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,250
yeah is there another question yeah

1041
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,680
I am wondering what's your opinion on

1042
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,870
speed and scalability because in my

1043
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,210
opinion one of the major drawbacks of

1044
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,580
something like toys that it's just used

1045
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,560
to slow to use it on a daily basis and

1046
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,600
it would be much more secure if

1047
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:37,290
everybody could use it on a daily basis

1048
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,819
without having in such drawbacks okay

1049
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,620
well that makes me think of a lot of

1050
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,690
different things to respond with one of

1051
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:45,380
them is that mixed networks tend to not

1052
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:48,300
be super low latency than to be maybe

1053
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,830
medium latency some of the historical

1054
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,220
designs are high latency like Leif

1055
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,290
mentioned but we think that mixed

1056
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,480
networks are very efficient for scaling

1057
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,370
up much more than tor in this sense that

1058
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,770
we don't need lots of nodes in our

1059
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:03,990
network to scale right we don't need

1060
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,370
lots of route unpredictability right we

1061
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,160
just need enough nodes to handle the

1062
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:11,310
traffic capacity and currently we have

1063
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,279
two public key operations per Sphynx

1064
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:16,620
packet and I mean there's some

1065
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,260
computational overhead but it's it's

1066
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,880
manageable so I think I think mixing

1067
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,970
would scale very well probably to

1068
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,830
millions of users and for a different

1069
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,529
type of application rights it's probably

1070
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:30,890
not going to be video conferencing it's

1071
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:34,140
probably gonna be lower bandwidth

1072
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,520
applications maybe maybe high bandwidth

1073
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,589
applications would work over longer

1074
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,450
periods of time this is not a thing that

1075
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:42,330
you're going to browse the web over in

1076
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,279
real time exactly you could use this as

1077
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,830
a transport for downloading web content

1078
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,200
you could have a and that's something

1079
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:54,299
that various people are considering but

1080
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,160
the it's it's not a replacement for tor

1081
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,280
which is ultimately gives you TCP

1082
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,629
connections where you expect to have a

1083
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,400
pretty low latency

1084
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,410
another interesting side note is that

1085
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,240
tour has exit notes and generally

1086
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,279
speaking mixed networks don't have exit

1087
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,808
notes to the rest of the internet we

1088
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:12,849
could have services that the edge of

1089
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:15,730
network that perhaps go and retrieve

1090
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:17,380
something for you like maybe some web

1091
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,819
content or you could have offline

1092
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,349
browser that do browse the web the way

1093
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,420
Richard Stallman does where you send an

1094
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:27,400
email to a process named replies with a

1095
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:30,160
snapshot you know yeah so yeah we get to

1096
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,690
control the entire network if we and we

1097
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,879
can put decoy traffic everywhere if we

1098
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,670
don't exit right so it's one of the

1099
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,589
advantages thank you for this in

1100
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:44,259
detailed response do we now have a

1101
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:45,970
question from the internet that is not

1102
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,529
the case so please give a warm round of

1103
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,089
applause for this very interesting to

1104
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:52,239
talk to David and lead
