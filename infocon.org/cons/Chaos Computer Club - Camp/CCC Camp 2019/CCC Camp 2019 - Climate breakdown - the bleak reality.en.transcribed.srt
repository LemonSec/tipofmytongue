[Music]

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,560
next on our stage we have a we will

3
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:25,279
follow up on what to expect when our

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:29,598
world gets hotter and hotter and I want

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:37,640
you all to welcome Hannah a big applause

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:41,180
please yeah Hannah will talk about

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:46,339
climate breakdown the reality is bleak

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:50,860
and without further ado please enjoy the

9
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:55,159
talk and I hand over to the Hannah hello

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:58,460
yeah if I wanted to start with a bit of

11
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:01,070
motivation because like you may have

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,409
seen me before talking on CCC events and

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,950
it's usually either about ACC IT

14
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:11,600
security or about general issues with

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:13,310
science so you may wonder why is he now

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,439
talking about climate change and I

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,719
actually was kind of a climate activists

18
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,928
for a long time and I also wrote for

19
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,640
some time for climate for a news

20
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:26,929
publication which was specifically on

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,749
climate change but I kind of dropped out

22
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:33,710
of the topic which was was due to

23
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:37,420
frustration due to other things kind of

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:41,630
work better for me but then they came

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,759
2018 and several things happened like I

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:50,560
mean you all know we had an extremely

27
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:54,619
dry summer then I noticed suddenly the

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,219
Humber forest was in the news every day

29
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:00,049
which is like there's a protest camp

30
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:02,630
from people who want to stop the coal

31
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,579
mine and like it's been there for I

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,810
think five years already

33
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,728
at that point but then suddenly it was

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,760
mainstream news like nobody had like

35
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,730
basically there was not much attention

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,329
for it before and now yeah and then of

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,420
course

38
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,790
Clayton burg started her school strike

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,450
and there was the Friday's for future

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,819
movement

41
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,060
and there were new groups like

42
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,859
extinction rebellion I actually went to

43
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:36,530
a talk from extinction rebellion in

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:41,120
spring which was very extreme and very

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:44,870
emotional and very impressive and so and

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,230
yeah like a mixture of these things made

47
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,330
me think yeah what's my role in this

48
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,268
like it bit brought the topic back on

49
00:02:50,330 --> 00:03:01,370
the table and yeah one thing I did is I

50
00:02:53,269 --> 00:03:07,100
submitted this talk here yeah so where

51
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:11,239
are we so this is a graph of well co2

52
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:15,799
emissions as you can see it's usually

53
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:20,930
growing it goes till 2017 it grew him

54
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:24,230
more in 2018 you can also see like

55
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,150
there's this point in time like for a

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,209
short time the world really started to

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,609
get serious to do something about it

58
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,459
well or no I mean that was the economic

59
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:37,850
crisis so it wasn't really intentional

60
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,950
through but that was kind of the

61
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,989
economic crisis was the only point there

62
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,730
where you can really see that there was

63
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:49,190
a bit of a drop in emissions but

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:53,260
otherwise emissions just go up we have

65
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:58,370
now roughly one degree warming and

66
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:01,220
increasingly we can see the effects we

67
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,200
had a big heat wave in India in May and

68
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,420
Troon what you see on the left just like

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,940
this is a water reservoir how it's

70
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,488
usually and on the right lists all dried

71
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:15,459
out I think it's not so good to see but

72
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,459
like on the screen it looks very extreme

73
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,280
of course we had another heatwave in

74
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,380
Europe we had in in Germany we had the

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,760
highest temperatures ever measured and

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,169
it was beyond 42 degrees and like

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,690
historically usually the temperatures in

78
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,690
Germany never were beyond 40 degrees

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:42,349
we have wildfires in the Arctic which

80
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:44,979
like which we are at a scale that has

81
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:49,909
not been seen before as since this is

82
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:52,580
measured or observed we have melting in

83
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:57,409
Greenland which is much faster than what

84
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:05,030
the science predicted in the past yeah

85
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:07,580
so what is politics doing about this in

86
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,008
2015 there was the the Paris agreement

87
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,810
and like many people cheered the

88
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,669
environmentalists were happy in other

89
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,180
words finally doing something about it

90
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,818
and so this was kind of a worldwide

91
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:24,889
agreement which was the result of a very

92
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:27,379
long process of climate conferences what

93
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,599
does the Paris agreement say basically

94
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:34,159
says all nations agree to at least three

95
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:38,240
degrees of more global heating that may

96
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:41,060
not be what you heard about it but I

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,210
would say that this is more accurate

98
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,779
than what you probably heard about it so

99
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,779
where's the discrepancy so what this

100
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:56,180
agreement actually says is nations agree

101
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:59,300
to limit the global warming to well

102
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,419
below two degrees Celsius and also it

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,560
says that the nations agree to pursuing

104
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:08,990
efforts to limit the temperature

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:12,289
increase to 1.5 degrees but there's a

106
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:15,500
problem with this and this is they just

107
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:20,779
declare that they want to do this but

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,819
they don't have a plan how to do it so

109
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,860
this Paris agreement they have something

110
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,310
which is called nationally determined

111
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,409
contributions the idea is basically the

112
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,719
nations that come together they say okay

113
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:36,110
we wanted here to reduce our emissions

114
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:39,169
by that amount we do this to counter

115
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,629
climate change and if you add that up

116
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:43,639
there have been multiple studies you end

117
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,139
up with something like three degrees

118
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,680
there were also some studies that's at

119
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,080
more three point four degrees so

120
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,570
we have like a big gap here where the

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,599
nations say okay we want to limit it by

122
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,520
at least two degrees or even less but in

123
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,949
reality what they agreed upon will lead

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:07,750
us to three degrees or more that is if

125
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:11,210
they commit to these these voluntary

126
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,639
agreements which unfortunately they

127
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,940
usually don't like I mean if you're from

128
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,979
Germany you probably know Germany has

129
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,860
climate goals which by now it's already

130
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:23,750
clear for 2020 these goals will be

131
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,030
breached by a large amount and I mean

132
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,889
that was part of these agreed

133
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,888
contributions to do something about this

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,380
so I thought I make this a bit in a

135
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,660
table because these degree numbers they

136
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,080
often come up and to get a bit of an

137
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,030
idea like that's all of us when we talk

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,820
about this these degrees of warming it's

139
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,000
always like compared to what was before

140
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,570
we had interest realisation so right now

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,460
we're around one degree in the talk

142
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,599
before you heard one point one that's

143
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,030
minor details it's around one degree the

144
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,659
ambitious goal of the Paris agreement is

145
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:08,599
1.5 degree the kind of minimum goal is 2

146
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:11,659
degree what they actually agreed upon is

147
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,510
probably three degrees and if you take

148
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:19,159
the current policy it's three to four or

149
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,990
maybe even more of course there are

150
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,599
things in politics that are kind of

151
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,120
inverse we know we have a US president

152
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,710
who doesn't believe in global warming he

153
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,470
often has a very insightful

154
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,088
contributions on Twitter like your

155
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,430
record low temperatures and massive

156
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:38,510
amounts of snow where the hell is global

157
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:41,120
warming also this is a quote from the

158
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,968
Deputy Prime Minister of Australia they

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
had a meeting with people from from

160
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:48,440
small island states that are very much

161
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,689
threatened by sea level rise so many of

162
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,020
these island states will disappear in

163
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,670
the future and he said yeah I also get a

164
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,410
little bit annoyed when we have people

165
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,569
in those sort of countries pointing

166
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,430
finger at Australia and say we should be

167
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,450
shutting down all our resource sector so

168
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,359
that you know they were

169
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,020
continues to survive like how dare they

170
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,050
want to survive but there's also

171
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,260
positive things like Canada agreed to

172
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:20,390
declare climate emergency on the 17th of

173
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:24,110
June well sounds good right what does

174
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:27,380
that mean so on the 18th of June one day

175
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,480
later Canada approved the trans mountain

176
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,430
oil pipeline

177
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,400
the picture you're seeing here is oil

178
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,680
mining I'm not sure if you knew that

179
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,170
this is actually a thing but there's

180
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,739
something it's called tar sands which is

181
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,810
kind of oil in non liquid form and with

182
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,170
a very energy intensive process you can

183
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,670
turn it into liquid oil which Canada is

184
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,689
doing a lot and they kind of have a

185
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:56,839
problem that they cannot transport

186
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,600
enough away to make it economically

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,270
viable so that's why they want to build

188
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,770
this pipeline this pipeline has kind of

189
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,569
a long story

190
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,270
there was originally a company who

191
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,040
wanted to build it but then the company

192
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,310
stepped down and now the government

193
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,480
wants to build it itself so that's how

194
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:19,219
climate emergency looks in Canada I I

195
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,200
mean they are also currently a lot of

196
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,660
initiatives for example in Berlin where

197
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,670
people want cities to declare a climate

198
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:32,540
emergency I hope that's not there how

199
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,069
they want to go about this these are of

200
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,430
course some extremes but keep in mind

201
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:40,660
that like even countries that commit to

202
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,910
more ambitious goals for example Germany

203
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,689
usually you can sum it up that almost

204
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,699
nothing meaningful happens like

205
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,430
certainly nothing happens that would be

206
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:57,140
in line with a limiting climate change

207
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:02,000
to a level that is somehow acceptable so

208
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:04,670
what does the science tell us so in

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,880
climate science yes the IPCC which is a

210
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,290
a worldwide network of scientists and

211
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,820
they are kind of the mainstream of

212
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,010
climate science they summarized other

213
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,430
results from climate science and

214
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:21,800
they write reports every few years

215
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,770
there's a general report the last was

216
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,280
2014 and then there are occasionally

217
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:31,160
special reports on specific topics and

218
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,189
one of these more recent reports was the

219
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,980
special report on 1.5 degree that was

220
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,900
after the Paris agreement and the

221
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,050
question they asked in this report is

222
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,329
baby what's the difference between 1.5

223
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:52,370
degree warming and two degree warming

224
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:55,520
and yeah and the report had two major

225
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:59,060
messages one was there is a substantial

226
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,040
difference so it's not just a number

227
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,329
that's nice they are really massive

228
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,490
differences in the outcomes and also the

229
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,680
other message was like 1.5 degree that

230
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,750
is still doable under somewhat

231
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,939
optimistic assumptions if the world

232
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,930
immediately starts to transform to a

233
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:25,070
low-carbon economy which is not working

234
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:27,680
out so well so what did they say for

235
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:34,430
example here's a very nice picture of a

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:39,140
coral reef some of them look like this

237
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:41,689
and in the future probably all of them

238
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,020
will look like this so the estimate was

239
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:47,750
that if we have 1.5 degree warming then

240
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,360
70 to 90 percent of coral reefs will die

241
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:54,890
and if we have two degree warming than

242
00:12:50,360 --> 00:13:01,520
99 percent so basically all of them will

243
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:03,500
die then there were estimates on whether

244
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,550
we will have an ice-free Arctic in the

245
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:11,300
summer and the estimate was that with

246
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,870
1.5 degree this will happen in 10% of

247
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:19,579
all years and with two degrees this will

248
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:22,510
happen every summer we will have a bit

249
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,510
more sea level rise

250
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,029
there will also be many more people

251
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:33,060
affected by extreme heat waves and these

252
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,790
are the things like where you can I mean

253
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,380
when they're sea level rise then people

254
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,839
have to relocate so you will have

255
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,790
refugees when there are heat waves at

256
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,800
some point people just cannot live

257
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,480
somewhere anymore so these are the

258
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,339
things that have a lot of potential for

259
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,019
conflicts for migration movements these

260
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:57,089
are the things that will make it really

261
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:58,800
hard to keep up working civilization and

262
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,930
remember that right now we're on track

263
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,969
to two to four degrees which is much

264
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:08,130
more plausible than having two degree or

265
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:10,290
1.5 degree and they also had a rough

266
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,079
estimate what would be needed for 1.5

267
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,149
degree that would mean that revolt would

268
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:20,040
have to reduce the emissions by about

269
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:22,290
fifty percent twenty thirty in the

270
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,110
report it says forty five percent but

271
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,199
based on 2010 I'm not entirely sure why

272
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,360
they made this very specific year but

273
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,149
that would be roughly fifty percent from

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,639
now and the world needs to be carbon

275
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,649
neutral by 2050 which means no more

276
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,670
carbon emissions or if they are carbon

277
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:44,850
emissions so you would have to

278
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:47,010
compensate with other things but there's

279
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,139
also a question is like it's the IPCC

280
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,829
really telling us the full story here

281
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,959
and the following I'm gonna say I I

282
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,899
really don't want to get this as a

283
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,420
criticism of the IPCC because like these

284
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,930
are scientists that work under enormous

285
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:08,310
pressure like if you know like your it's

286
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,540
a committee that like politics has told

287
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,189
them yeah we want to know the science

288
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,410
and then the politicians tell them yeah

289
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,949
but we don't believe in that right I

290
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,990
mean stupid scientists so I think they

291
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,609
work on the very difficult conditions

292
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,690
and it's very understandable why these

293
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:27,480
things happen that but a lot of

294
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,240
scientists are worried that the IPCC is

295
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,360
really much too conservative in in its

296
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,220
predictions and so for example you can

297
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,540
see graphs like this

298
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:44,559
this the black line here is the estimate

299
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:49,299
from the IPCC report from 2007 on Arctic

300
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:51,879
sea level ice and the blue range is what

301
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:54,189
they assumed that's probably the de

302
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:58,569
Majan of error so we believe it will be

303
00:15:54,189 --> 00:16:02,069
inside this blue area and the red line

304
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:04,719
is what actually happened and this was

305
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:06,910
already outdated at the point where they

306
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
published it which is kind of another

307
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,899
problem like these IPCC reports are

308
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,599
often based on science that's already

309
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,749
maybe five years old when it gets into

310
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,769
the IPCC report and to enhance it a bit

311
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:23,139
I have added two more dots like 2012 was

312
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:26,109
until now the lowest point of Arctic sea

313
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:28,480
level rise in 2018 which is the last

314
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:35,410
measure we have because 2019 hasn't

315
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:37,869
isn't finished yet and in 2013 there was

316
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,819
a study where they they looked at at

317
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:42,910
various of these issues and previous

318
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:44,769
studies that had compared that had

319
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,439
looked at historic predictions from the

320
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:49,749
IPCC and they came to the conclusion

321
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,949
that available evidence address that

322
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,540
scientists have in fact been

323
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:55,389
conservative in their projections of the

324
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,399
impacts of climate change we suggest

325
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,100
therefore that scientists are bias not

326
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:02,619
towards Alama alarmism but there are

327
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,779
other the worst was cautious estimates

328
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:06,429
where we defined caution is erring on

329
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:08,709
the side of less rather than more

330
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,360
alarming predictions so what they are

331
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,039
saying here is yeah so there's

332
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,648
definitely a tendency that the

333
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:19,089
scientists tend to make it sound less

334
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:20,888
dramatic than it really is if you want

335
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,470
to know more about this in detail

336
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:25,059
there's this little booklet and you can

337
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,769
download it for free online which

338
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:32,049
explains many of these issues where

339
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:34,059
where the IPCC has under predicted

340
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,980
things and why this happened and ended

341
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:38,139
like they also quote a lot of scientists

342
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,679
who are working within the IPCC but were

343
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:44,168
kind of frustrated that they see that

344
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,720
their results are not fully represented

345
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:48,720
there that's worth a read

346
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,389
there's other this thing that like

347
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,570
climate scientists are telling us that

348
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:02,850
we need to act fast and then we kind of

349
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:04,620
can still make it but they've been

350
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,780
saying similar things for a long time

351
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,908
like you could see a very similar

352
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,428
message as 10 years ago 15 years ago

353
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:15,380
that we need to act really fast and then

354
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:19,320
we can still keep it below 2 degrees or

355
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,080
so what's going on here the science

356
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:27,330
didn't get more optimistic so quite the

357
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:30,809
contrary so how is that possible and one

358
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:36,030
explanation years so-called negative

359
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:39,240
emissions so by now all these scenarios

360
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,879
from the IPCC that limit warming to 2

361
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,140
degrees to 1.5 degrees and most that

362
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,150
limited to 2 degrees

363
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,730
assume that we will have negative

364
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,919
emissions in the future where we get the

365
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,909
carbon dioxide out of the air and do

366
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,280
something with it how can we get

367
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:57,409
negative emissions one way is to plant

368
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,980
trees

369
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:04,230
which is good we should do that but like

370
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,850
there was a study in the news two or

371
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,470
three weeks ago where they had very

372
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,209
optimistic predictions on what we could

373
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,309
reach with freeze and it was kind of

374
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,470
painted as yeah this is the easy way out

375
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,780
we can continue like we do we can fly

376
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,230
and drive our cars and plant a few trees

377
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,500
and everything is fine the study they

378
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,750
had a major flaw in not in the study

379
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,890
itself but in the way they presented it

380
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,419
in a press release where they kind of

381
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:34,860
estimated twice as much potential as

382
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:37,320
there really was in the study and yeah

383
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,918
so but in general like planting trees is

384
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,639
good but it has limits like trees need

385
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,740
space we don't have unlimited space and

386
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:51,780
also it kind of competes with other uses

387
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,580
of land we we need to grow food and we

388
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,809
will have more humans in the future and

389
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,360
we will have problems with food

390
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,250
production due to climate change so we

391
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,889
may also need more land for food so

392
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:05,470
there it's not an easy way out

393
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,090
so when we talk about negative emissions

394
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:12,100
we have to talk about this thing called

395
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:15,399
carbon capture and storage the idea here

396
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,918
is we take co2 either we take it

397
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,140
directly from maybe a power plant or we

398
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:26,230
get it out of the air and store it

399
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:28,299
underground so there was the kind of

400
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,150
bigger discussion about this in Germany

401
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:34,150
during the last wave of new coal power

402
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,980
plant constructions so what you often

403
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,690
hear there was something like yeah okay

404
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,070
we know that it's bad with these coal

405
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,750
power plants they produce a lot of

406
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,789
carbon dioxide but it's not really

407
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,190
problem because later we're gonna put

408
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:47,370
the CCS technology on those plants and

409
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:51,039
then it's not a problem anymore

410
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:52,389
rotten father had a very big press

411
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,908
conference where they announced they'd

412
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,870
have the first carbon neutral power

413
00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:05,440
plant coming you to record power plant

414
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:07,239
that never happens one reason was there

415
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,039
was resistance so in the areas where

416
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,450
they wanted to store the calm dioxide

417
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,620
underground there was a lot of

418
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,270
controversy but also similar projects in

419
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,030
other countries where there was no

420
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,309
resistance also failed and the simple

421
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,500
reason is it's too costly like it costs

422
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,840
a lot of money you reduce the already

423
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,539
low efficiency of your coal power plant

424
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,010
even more if you want to add the CCS

425
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:35,408
technology and right now there are only

426
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,530
a handful of CCS projects operating

427
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,179
worldwide so and most of them are

428
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,000
actually for something which is called

429
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:46,750
enhanced oil recovery which means you

430
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,230
pump carbon dioxide in an oil field so

431
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:53,590
you can get a bit more oil out of it as

432
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,059
you can guess that's not a good idea for

433
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:59,139
the climate because then you have more

434
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:00,730
oil and you will probably burn it but

435
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:06,909
then you can make it economically viable

436
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:08,950
so yeah so but what I think what this

437
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,360
story from Germany tells you that if you

438
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,770
talk about things like carbon capture

439
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,570
and storage there's always kind of this

440
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,520
risk that people will use this as an

441
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,770
excuse they say yeah we can

442
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,440
have carbon-free coal power plants which

443
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,980
didn't happen but it was still used as

444
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,110
an excuse but we were checking out

445
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:30,700
negative emissions and not about coal

446
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,229
power plants with fewer emissions so one

447
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,340
idea here is that you could use

448
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,290
bioenergy and CCS like for example you

449
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,149
burn trees and then you capture the

450
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,790
carbon stored underground because the

451
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,340
trees when they grow up they store

452
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:51,540
carbon and if you dance Troy that would

453
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:53,830
effectively be negative emissions yeah

454
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,720
that obviously comes with all the

455
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,870
problems that you usually have have with

456
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,320
bio energy it needs space if you have

457
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:05,649
monocultures maybe pesticides there is

458
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,409
sometimes land sometimes forests are cut

459
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:14,380
down to plant palm oil trees to use them

460
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:16,420
for energy so and the bio energy itself

461
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,190
can be a source of emissions for example

462
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,080
if you cut down the rainforests for palm

463
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,020
oil trees then cutting down the

464
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,500
rainforests will create the emissions so

465
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,600
this is problematic and also we will

466
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,680
already have problems with food security

467
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,179
and bioenergy can increase that problem

468
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:39,760
because we will have more competition

469
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:41,830
for land so that is kind of why by now

470
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,020
the scientists are also very skeptical

471
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,909
and say we should maybe use as little as

472
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:51,010
possible from this bioenergy and CCS

473
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,870
another idea that is gaining a bit of

474
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,700
traction is so-called diode air capture

475
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,459
which is just you build a machine that

476
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:02,230
takes co2 out of the air and stores it

477
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:05,080
on the ground this is less problematic

478
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:09,340
from a land-use perspective because this

479
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,990
like using trees or plants to suck in

480
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,990
carbon dioxide that needs a lot of space

481
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:20,020
this is the space not the problem here

482
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:23,170
but obviously these machines will

483
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,350
require energy which will be mostly

484
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:29,380
electric energy because like it doesn't

485
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:32,629
make sense to power them with coal or

486
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,270
Mithra clean energy and how it makes no

487
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,030
sense and there was a study where they

488
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,190
looked at like yeah how does this play

489
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,680
out with the IPCC scenarios and they

490
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,620
they calculated that this could use up

491
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:49,850
to 300 exit rules per year if you look

492
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:53,560
at the IPCC 1.5 degree scenarios to

493
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:57,830
compare that the world electricity

494
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:59,750
generation is currently 75 x a Joule so

495
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,929
we would kind of have to increase the

496
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:06,320
world electricity production fourfold

497
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:09,490
and then make it green and use that to

498
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:13,370
capture carbon dioxide from the air

499
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:20,360
which sounds like it sounds really like

500
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:22,879
science fiction so yeah so one criticism

501
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,850
of the IPCC is that they're optimistic

502
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,190
scenarios rely on technology that

503
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:31,070
largely doesn't really exist or only in

504
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,380
small plans but it doesn't exist at a

505
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,780
reasonable scale and it's very

506
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,570
questionable if it's plausible to scale

507
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,420
it up in a way that it can match these

508
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:45,409
negative emissions that they think we

509
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:49,430
should have and even if the technology

510
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,470
works like how do you make that work in

511
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,450
a political and economical way you can

512
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,120
think about it like I mean sucking out

513
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:59,330
carbon dioxide out of the air that

514
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,550
doesn't make any money where's the

515
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,710
business model here and I mean of course

516
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,450
yeah I know the idea here is at some

517
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,930
point we will have a worldwide carbon

518
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,850
market and they will get paid but you

519
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:17,210
can also have questions here about how

520
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:20,030
plausible that is but probably the

521
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:25,840
biggest criticism of the IPCC is around

522
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:29,120
so-called feedback loops so and also

523
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,520
so-called tipping points so many

524
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,189
scientists think that the IPCC has not

525
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,540
sufficiently considered these effects

526
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:41,299
and a feedback loop is when global

527
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:45,499
warming causes more global warming

528
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:48,200
and one example is the so called albedo

529
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:50,659
effect where here you see an image of

530
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,749
ice and water and you can see the ice is

531
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:56,509
bright and the water is dark so bright

532
00:26:53,749 --> 00:27:00,350
things reflect sunlight and dark things

533
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:03,379
don't so if the ice is gone then more

534
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:06,080
sunlight will warm up the water and we

535
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:07,939
will have more warming otherwise some of

536
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,158
the sunlight would be reflected back

537
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:15,230
into space and would not warm up the

538
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,389
earth yeah that's what I just did and

539
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,909
there are plenty of these feedback loops

540
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:23,869
in the talk before I hurt their right 60

541
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:26,929
identified some of them are like the

542
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:29,509
melting permafrost is releasing methane

543
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:31,639
methane is also a greenhouse gas and a

544
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:33,859
much more effect much more potent

545
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:38,238
greenhouse gas at least on the short

546
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:41,119
term then if pit box die

547
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:45,440
that's a tough Moore in German if you

548
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:47,959
don't know the word if forests burn like

549
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,639
if they regrow it's kind of fine if they

550
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,320
agree will grow at the same speed but if

551
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:55,488
they burn down faster than they can

552
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:59,629
regrow we have also increased warming

553
00:27:55,489 --> 00:28:03,049
and also if more water evaporates their

554
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:05,449
water evaporated water itself is also

555
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:10,399
acting as a greenhouse gas and there are

556
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:12,830
many more of these and the kind of

557
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,299
horror scenario is if you think that it

558
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,340
could you could run into a situation

559
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,389
where there are all these effects where

560
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,639
the warming is creating more warming and

561
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:24,379
that is creating even more warming and

562
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:26,658
then you may have a situation where all

563
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:28,039
these effects accelerate each other and

564
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:31,039
you have something which is called

565
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,570
runaway climate change where you end up

566
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,730
in a situation where it doesn't really

567
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,049
matter what humanity does at this point

568
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:42,889
it just keeps getting warmer and there

569
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:46,759
was a study I think last year where a

570
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:50,539
group of scientists can try to give an

571
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,129
overview of this issue and summarize the

572
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,600
most important this graph is from the

573
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:57,270
study so and you

574
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,389
can all see that there are the yellow

575
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:04,650
ones are the ones where they are already

576
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,960
at risk of reaching that tipping point

577
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,840
or they already have for example for the

578
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,880
West Antarctic Ice Sheet currently the

579
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,100
assumption seems to be that there's no

580
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,710
way to safe that it will just melt and

581
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:20,730
there's nothing we can do about it

582
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:24,299
and that could lead to a situation where

583
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:26,460
these other effects that only started a

584
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,158
higher temperature also get started and

585
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:35,400
we run to a situation where it cannot be

586
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:37,679
controlled anymore and the scary message

587
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,360
from that study is that they say they

588
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,980
cannot really say when this will happen

589
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,979
because there's so many uncertainties

590
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:51,210
but it could already happen if in a two

591
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:52,710
degree warming scenario yeah after we

592
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,130
talked about the science let's talk

593
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,650
about the media because they think it's

594
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,840
quite obvious that large parts of the

595
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,360
population are not really aware of the

596
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,840
scale and the risks of the kamek crisis

597
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,280
like I mean they know that there's

598
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,110
something happening with climate change

599
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,570
and probably that has to do with co2

600
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,879
emissions but I don't read about runaway

601
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:19,710
climate change in the news I'm not sure

602
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:22,230
about you and a problem that has been

603
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,900
identified as so-called false balance

604
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:28,350
and what does that mean I have a nice

605
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,990
comic here so here's a guy from

606
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,939
television and he is interviewing an

607
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,980
astrophysicist about the solar system

608
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,780
and then he wants to balance that

609
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,340
opinion with someone from the Flat Earth

610
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:43,289
Society now that's of course ridiculous

611
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,020
but that's also what you often have when

612
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:49,379
it's about climate change so you will

613
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,210
often have a situation where media asks

614
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,799
the climate scientists and then they ask

615
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,539
someone who thinks that climate change

616
00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:02,070
is not happening and there was a study

617
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:05,580
recently that tried to quantify that and

618
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,320
they made a list of a list of prominent

619
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,428
climate scientists and a list of

620
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,820
prominent so-called

621
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:17,789
variance so people who deny the science

622
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:19,980
of climate change I have also not read a

623
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:22,200
lot hood this in the media because the

624
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,759
media was busy calculating kaito-kun

625
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:30,419
Berg's carbon emissions but overall the

626
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,999
so-called contrarians had 49% more media

627
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,619
visibility it was mostly in the US so

628
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:37,919
not sure how much this can be

629
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:39,840
transmitted to Germany and even in

630
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:45,659
mainstream sources like the New York

631
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,918
Times it was roughly equal and there

632
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,779
were a few questions about the

633
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,669
methodology there are some people said

634
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:53,220
okay maybe there are just more climate

635
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:55,259
scientists than these contrarians but

636
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,869
even still like this looks really

637
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,730
disastrous and this is I mean this

638
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:03,869
debate about false balance has been

639
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:06,269
going on for many years and like in 2011

640
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:08,490
the BBC had a big discussion about it

641
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:10,649
and said they want to cover this in a

642
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,720
more reasonable way where they don't try

643
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:17,879
to balance scientific facts with some

644
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,830
crackpots idea but also like I mean

645
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:21,719
climate denial in the media is only one

646
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:26,309
problem you often have this thing that

647
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,369
it's simply ignored like I said there's

648
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:32,509
an article about airport expansion like

649
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:35,879
I don't know in Berlin new airport ok

650
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:37,649
especially humid like and then there's

651
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:40,969
not a single word about climate or

652
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:45,840
emissions or anything or there was

653
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:49,049
Charles Koch who was a oil industry guy

654
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,389
and who funded a lot of climate denial

655
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:53,970
groups and the Washington he he died I

656
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:56,219
think yesterday and the Washington Post

657
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,019
had a poetry on him and they didn't

658
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:04,470
mention that he was like a big fan of

659
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:07,710
climate you know yeah there are a few

660
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:10,649
positive tendencies where you feel some

661
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,840
people in the media get it so the

662
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:14,699
Guardian they published a new policy or

663
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,869
said they want to avoid terms like

664
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,690
climate change and global warming

665
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:21,119
because they feel these are terms that

666
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,230
sound too harmless they tend to play

667
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,659
down things

668
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:28,320
and want instead to use more terms like

669
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,880
climate crisis or global heating not

670
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,960
sure if you have noticed I also try to

671
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,850
do this for my talk there's an

672
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,510
initiative right now which is called

673
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:43,050
covering climate now over several media

674
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:46,250
publications commit to to make a week

675
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:49,409
where they focus on climate topics

676
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:53,490
before the action day a 20th of

677
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,780
September there are some larger

678
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,200
publications in there

679
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:00,360
The Guardian CBS the nation there's

680
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,500
currently no major publication from

681
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,040
Germany in there

682
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,610
they are like clean energy wire and this

683
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,639
reporter but nothing not none of the big

684
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:18,140
media publications support this yet in

685
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:20,940
Germany okay so what needs to happen

686
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:25,529
obviously we need to stop burning fossil

687
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:29,040
fuels so we need to get rid of things

688
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:31,020
like this this is a ranch valley it's

689
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,880
not that far from here it's like the

690
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:37,860
opencast mine where they mine lignite

691
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,040
like it which is a very bad form of coal

692
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,410
like even worse than normal call and in

693
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,300
the back there's this big gentrified a

694
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:50,790
power plant I don't have a lot of

695
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,660
positive messages in this talk but I

696
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,659
have one for you

697
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:01,319
building renewable energy is probably

698
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,089
much easier than people thought and this

699
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,060
is like one of my favorite graphs on

700
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,520
renewable energy so this is from a guy

701
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,290
called ok Hoekstra if you feel like with

702
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,880
all this climate doom you want to have

703
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:16,680
some positive messages in your social

704
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:20,180
media feed you should follow this guy so

705
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:23,549
the black line is photovoltaic

706
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:26,490
installations worldwide like how they

707
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,850
happen for real all the colored lines

708
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:32,250
are what the International Energy Agency

709
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:34,410
predicted for solar installations so

710
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,580
they kind of every time they make a new

711
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,410
report

712
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,200
like they recognize there's more solar

713
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,700
than they predicted in their last report

714
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,180
but then they predict okay it's going

715
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,560
down a bit and then maybe up a bit like

716
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,330
they don't seem to recognize that

717
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,009
there's maybe a systemic problem with

718
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:55,620
the prediction here and like it gets

719
00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:01,860
worse like the latest one they go down

720
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:04,589
even more and yeah so this looks like an

721
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,690
exponential growth which usually it's

722
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:09,240
bad but for photovoltaics that's like

723
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,950
really good although I mean not to get

724
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,089
put two positives that's all still

725
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:17,520
growing or in very low numbers but I

726
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,060
mean that that's really a message that

727
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,530
that also needs to get through more that

728
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:29,370
renewable energy has been growing in a

729
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:34,830
way that nobody predicted and like yes

730
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:36,900
there's a way to fix things here so yeah

731
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,180
we should change the electricity per

732
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,600
sector it's important it's one of the

733
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,250
really huge chunks of carbon emissions

734
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,259
but also that's kind of the easy part

735
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,450
even though I know there problems with

736
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,520
storage and so lies only during the day

737
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:54,810
and the wind doesn't always but I think

738
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:58,560
these are solvable problems there are

739
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:03,240
some sectors that are much harder and

740
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:10,340
this is a cement plant in Berlin do you

741
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:15,299
know how cement is made yeah that's true

742
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:19,980
so I have a little formula for you with

743
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,350
some chemistry so you take something

744
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:26,310
which is basically limestone and which

745
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:29,130
is chemically mostly calcium carbonate

746
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:32,940
and then you burn it and this turns it

747
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:38,040
into a calcium oxide and co2 so you see

748
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:40,170
there's co2 here and the crucial part is

749
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,870
this is co2 that does not come from

750
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,900
energy like there's no coal here there's

751
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:48,540
no fossil fuels that comes from the

752
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,730
chemistry of turning this limestone into

753
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:54,450
some

754
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:57,540
and this is 5% of all carbon dioxide

755
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,460
emissions and the overall emissions are

756
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:06,870
even higher because we need energy to do

757
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:09,690
that and to burn it and and like we have

758
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:12,870
no idea how to change that there are a

759
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:15,570
few experimental technologies to make

760
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:17,490
cement in different ways but that kind

761
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:21,180
of basic research there's nothing that

762
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:23,009
we can roll out now so that's the hot

763
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:26,370
stuff you talk about when you want to go

764
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:28,680
to carbon neutrality and there are other

765
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,509
hard sectors for example airplanes I

766
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,450
mean ok they now talk about soon fuels

767
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:36,120
where you kind of turn electricity into

768
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:41,160
oil you can do that it's very expensive

769
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:44,400
not very efficient they're steel which

770
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,230
is similar to the cement it's also a

771
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,660
chemical process that releases carbon

772
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,730
dioxide you can also do that with

773
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,910
electricity but it's also very expensive

774
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,650
and very inefficient there's fertilizers

775
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:59,160
if you put out fertilizers they will

776
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:07,440
release nitrogen dioxide which is also a

777
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:11,850
greenhouse gas so yeah then just this

778
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,650
topic of geoengineering so at some point

779
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,170
you come up with the question can we do

780
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:21,900
something to counteract this warming

781
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:24,120
from the greenhouse effect one thing

782
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,910
there is which is under the umbrella

783
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:32,790
term solar radiation management which is

784
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:37,529
doing things that we reflect more

785
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:39,509
sunlight there are ideas that are

786
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,330
relatively sound relatively harmless

787
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:45,720
like painting your roofs in whites but I

788
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:47,279
also the effects are not that big there

789
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,029
are things that are more dangerous like

790
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,740
putting aerosols into the atmosphere and

791
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,500
some sound a bit more like science

792
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,839
fiction like you have some flying

793
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,410
objects that have big mirrors and put

794
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,000
them all around the earth

795
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:08,040
there was also study about this a few

796
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,620
days ago yeah this is not very widely

797
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,050
discussed yet and for example the IPCC

798
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:19,200
very explicitly says they don't consider

799
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:21,120
solar radiation management right now and

800
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,089
under normal circumstances you would say

801
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:27,180
like pulling chemicals into the

802
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:30,210
atmosphere and we're not really sure

803
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,520
what that's gonna do it's probably

804
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:38,370
dangerous they're probably negative side

805
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:39,750
effects sounds really crazy but you kind

806
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,540
of wonder if we end up in a situation

807
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,660
where we're it's either this or the

808
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:50,100
planet is largely uninhabited we may

809
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,629
need to have that discussion but there's

810
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,180
also the thing like it's the discussion

811
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,770
itself already dangerous because like

812
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,750
there were already politicians who said

813
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,750
yeah we can put a few aerosols into the

814
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,970
atmosphere that solves the problem and

815
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:06,390
so it's similar to the debate with

816
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,919
carbon capture and storage where people

817
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:12,089
may think this is an easy way out

818
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,490
although it's kind of not really what we

819
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:17,880
want to do like we should really focus

820
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,509
on reducing carbon emissions as much as

821
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,880
possible

822
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:23,610
but maybe we should start having a

823
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,650
discussion how we can even reasonably

824
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,930
discuss about geoengineering and and

825
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:32,300
what would be the political framework to

826
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,299
discuss something like that and yeah

827
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,870
then there's a term that comes up often

828
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:45,509
from activists where they say yeah what

829
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:47,700
do we want climate justice and and this

830
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,370
is of a bit of an abstract term and I

831
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,890
want to kind of ground this a bit with a

832
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:55,049
very specific example so right now we

833
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,299
heard all the news that in Brazil and in

834
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:02,160
also in Bolivia there's a lot of

835
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:05,310
rainforest burning and this is I mean

836
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,470
this is a disaster and there's also a

837
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,570
big risk that this will put the Amazon

838
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:12,629
rainforest over one of these tipping

839
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:14,489
points which may then introduce further

840
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,239
warming

841
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:20,369
but like here's a news article that was

842
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,190
it's not a current article but it was

843
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:26,299
from spring but were headline says

844
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:31,979
Brazil puts economy over the rainforests

845
00:42:26,299 --> 00:42:35,690
how they are they so like you may wonder

846
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:40,649
like if we're from a rich country and

847
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:42,989
doing this and we complain about poor

848
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,369
countries putting the economy over

849
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:52,680
ecology which we also do all the time

850
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:54,930
there's a problem here and how about

851
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,669
this which countries could pay poorer

852
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:58,669
countries to protect the rainforest

853
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:13,589
who knows who this guy is really know

854
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:15,209
almost no okay you're too young I I

855
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:16,709
think this guy is at least partly

856
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:19,859
responsible for what's going on in

857
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:22,288
Brazil right now his name is Dirk niba

858
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,420
he was a Ministry of development in

859
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:26,969
Germany

860
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:29,660
he's from the free Democratic Party you

861
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:35,039
can see that with the yellow on the side

862
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:38,038
in 2007 the Rafael Correa who was back

863
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,489
then the president of Ecuador they they

864
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,739
had a nice oil field which was

865
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:47,130
unfortunately in a national park in the

866
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:51,900
rainforest and the president said yeah

867
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:55,680
we're willing to not get that oil out

868
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,420
we'll protect the rainforest but only if

869
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,118
the world is willing to compensate us

870
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,089
for the losses here and only half of the

871
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,940
losses like we calculate how much money

872
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:07,619
you would make selling this oil and if

873
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,839
you pay us half of that we will leave

874
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,509
the oil in the ground forever we will

875
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,078
save a lot of carbon emissions

876
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:15,079
rainforest will be fine

877
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:20,069
there were a few countries willing to

878
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:23,519
support it the biggest contributions

879
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:25,109
were from France and Spain and for quite

880
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,180
a while it looked like Germany would

881
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,360
support it too like they were even pull

882
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,490
it

883
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:35,040
in the Conservative Party who were very

884
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:38,669
positive about this but Germany pulled

885
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,880
out of the project and the guy I showed

886
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,800
you the picture that neighbor he was

887
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,450
responsible for that because he said he

888
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,840
doesn't like this approach he prefers

889
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:51,049
market-based mechanisms so if you hear

890
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:55,470
that again from members of that party

891
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:59,160
maybe remember them of this story so the

892
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:03,330
SUNY ITT initiative failed in 2013 and

893
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,910
now they are drilling oil there so I

894
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,440
think the rich country sent a message

895
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,589
there and that was like we're not

896
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:15,990
willing to pay for the rainforest and

897
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:17,040
that's kind of a tragedy so how did this

898
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:21,330
all go so wrong

899
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:25,640
I think a big thing is we we really need

900
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:28,080
to recognize the big failure here like

901
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,960
nothing that has been done until now had

902
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,810
any meaningful impact in slowing this

903
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,990
down or stopping this and there's a

904
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:38,820
failure in climate policy diplomacy and

905
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:41,549
also in the environmental movement and I

906
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,380
think like a lot of also energy always

907
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,590
need to ask themselves some very tough

908
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:48,780
questions and I'm quite amazed that many

909
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,330
of these more traditional NGOs how

910
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,630
silent they are right now like this is a

911
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:56,460
big topic now and extinction rebellion

912
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,530
and Friday's for future are getting all

913
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:03,330
the attentions and you don't hear much

914
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:07,230
from them and I feel they need to have a

915
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:09,960
very tough discussion and like there was

916
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,880
a comment in a German newspaper a few

917
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,650
days ago where they said basically

918
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,560
extinction rebellion should try to

919
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,910
become like the BND which I found

920
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:24,420
completely ridiculous

921
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:27,210
but yeah we should recognize that the

922
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:30,000
actions that would be required to do

923
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:32,510
anything meaningful here are not even

924
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,980
part of the political discourse like

925
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,530
cutting down carbon emissions by half

926
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,820
which would mean cutting them down even

927
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:44,070
more in a rich country till 2030

928
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,810
like try to ask the people from the

929
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,790
green party if they have a plan for this

930
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:49,790
like I don't think they have one

931
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,190
[Music]

932
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,560
extinction rebellion has this demand to

933
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,050
tell the truth I think that's a good

934
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:07,650
idea

935
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:09,570
kind of obvious yeah yeah and I also

936
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,850
think that part of the problem here is

937
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:15,360
that in the past there was also often a

938
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:17,130
tendency to give a hopeful message we

939
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,900
have so many solutions we're doing so

940
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:23,610
many nice things here we have all these

941
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:25,650
nice projects really which but it kind

942
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:29,640
of didn't recognize the overall failure

943
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:33,000
and this I think was particularly true

944
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,920
for the climate conferences and the

945
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,830
climate treaties like both the Kyoto

946
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,820
Protocol and the Paris Protocol

947
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:41,069
basically they didn't do anything

948
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:47,610
meaningful but the environmental

949
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:50,550
movement was cheering for them as we're

950
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:52,520
at CCC camp here I thought I should talk

951
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:56,010
a bit maybe what can take people do I

952
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:59,400
feel this is coming up quite a bit like

953
00:47:56,010 --> 00:48:01,770
I mean I hadn't expected that there are

954
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,840
so many climate talks here and we have

955
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,840
kind of almost a climate Village there

956
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:11,220
but if you have good answers to this I

957
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,439
would like to hear them because it's

958
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,209
often sounds like okay yeah or our

959
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,850
computers need electricity you should be

960
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:21,510
green it's probably not the things that

961
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:26,220
make a big impact I have a few proposals

962
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:28,710
what you should not do building some

963
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:31,830
libertarian utopia technology that's

964
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:33,450
based on wasting a lot of electricity as

965
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:36,529
much as possible all the time is

966
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,529
probably not a good idea

967
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,299
yeah you I think you know what I'm

968
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:44,299
talking about

969
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,209
if you can find a way to kill but

970
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:55,309
Bitcoin like that would have an impact

971
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:55,309
your heck us think about that really

972
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:15,829
yeah what's the tech industry doing what

973
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:22,380
do you think this is any guess yeah

974
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:24,089
roughly like that no no boom so I call

975
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:30,000
this the Google division for accelerated

976
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:31,680
climate chaos this is Google's

977
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,339
department for services for the oil

978
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:42,480
industry I mean don't you see it like

979
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:44,609
here's an oil rig in gray yeah ok

980
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,000
there's also solar cells but if you

981
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:49,680
scroll down it says yeah if they are

982
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,710
computing demands grow oil and gas

983
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,328
companies like Schlumberger to cha

984
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:56,309
Anadarko and others rely on Google cloud

985
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:58,349
to scale workloads such as seismic

986
00:49:56,309 --> 00:50:01,940
interpretation regression analysis and

987
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:01,940
classification and so on and so on I

988
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:11,308
mean that's if you want to ask it kind

989
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,259
of like a made-up example for

990
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:17,869
greenwashing right yeah don't be evil

991
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:20,339
[Music]

992
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:23,849
and I just picked Google because this

993
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:26,069
webpage was so ridiculous but there was

994
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:30,180
a very well researched article on

995
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:32,759
Gizmodo recently were like all the big

996
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,589
cloud companies have departments that

997
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,359
offer specific services to the oil

998
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:42,180
industry and they make a lot of deals

999
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,299
with with yeah lots of money involved

1000
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:48,480
they also like yeah you can use machine

1001
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:50,550
learning to find more oil and drill more

1002
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,240
efficiently

1003
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:57,010
yeah that was mostly it I wanted to ask

1004
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,930
you if you want to join some protests

1005
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:02,650
and because I have some suggestions for

1006
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:04,470
you there's a there's a protest against

1007
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:08,080
the International car fair in Frankfurt

1008
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:10,089
at the 14th of September then of course

1009
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,980
there's the global climate strike with

1010
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:15,100
Friday's for future and many others

1011
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,480
supporting them 20th of September and

1012
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,600
there will be more actions in the week

1013
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,300
following it and extinction rebellion

1014
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,480
will have worldwide actions on 7th of

1015
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:37,780
October so yeah support these

1016
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:40,750
organizations and thank you yeah

1017
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:43,960
thank you hello so we have some time for

1018
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:46,840
questions and I already see someone

1019
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,590
lined up at the microphone hey can I ask

1020
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:54,100
you to please speak loud and clear and

1021
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:59,140
yeah so please check check check

1022
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:02,200
ok this message is very bleak and I am

1023
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,359
you know devastated very emotional so

1024
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,149
this is like a general message it is

1025
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:09,400
okay to feel these emotions it is okay

1026
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:11,740
if I we connect our brains with our

1027
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:15,609
hearts because when I first learned

1028
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:18,930
about this I wanted to cry and to cry it

1029
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:22,270
is okay but it also can give us energy

1030
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:24,940
to do meaningful projects there are

1031
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:28,869
large scale engineering projects 50

1032
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:31,510
years ago we went to the moon so now if

1033
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:34,600
we apply our engineering resources I

1034
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:37,540
believe we can reverse climate change

1035
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:39,430
this will require a lot of changes on

1036
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,710
the United Nations on the government

1037
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:44,879
levels and - thank you very much for

1038
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,880
this presentation thank you

1039
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,150
yeah I guess that was not a question oh

1040
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,820
there's this think that was pretty much

1041
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:56,600
a statement thank you for that all right

1042
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,600
next question please

1043
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,420
first of all thanks a lot for the talk

1044
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,090
really really good really nice to have

1045
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,450
these resources we're not trying to be

1046
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:08,369
too vague or too Airy fairy if you could

1047
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,919
click your fingers and change one thing

1048
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:12,660
or a few what would that be or in more

1049
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,910
political terms if there were

1050
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:20,430
theoretical extreme actions that could

1051
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:22,140
be taken what should they be mmm I guess

1052
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,919
the I mean the thing that has the

1053
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:35,040
biggest impact is stopping coal that

1054
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:37,560
would be the first step right first of

1055
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:42,270
all thank you very much I really really

1056
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:45,810
like to talk and I had an idea what

1057
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:49,259
maybe hackers also could do and because

1058
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:50,670
I was really happy to come here and meet

1059
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,500
all these hackers because I'm a

1060
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:55,760
completely dummy I even cannot do

1061
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,080
calculations in MATLAB or something

1062
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,150
three weeks ago we were sitting together

1063
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,330
with scientists for future and Bremen

1064
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:06,330
and we were talking about that only 10

1065
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:10,319
to 15% of the Germans know what Friday's

1066
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:12,720
for future is and what they demand so

1067
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:17,400
this is unbelievable because everyone

1068
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,500
for Navas knows us knows it and so we

1069
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,670
have to somehow break out of these

1070
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:26,490
social media bubbles and I don't know

1071
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:30,030
how it works exactly but I had the idea

1072
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:34,220
that maybe hackers could help us to

1073
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:37,590
place climate content in other bubbles

1074
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:41,339
to raise awareness which doesn't change

1075
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:42,690
the world but it would support us the

1076
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,580
scientists because the scientists are

1077
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,630
complete dummies with about

1078
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:50,549
communication and internet and stuff I

1079
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:52,640
don't know if it helps but this was my

1080
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:55,500
idea

1081
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:59,009
yeah I'm not entirely sure if the

1082
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,460
hackers are the best group to do public

1083
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,460
relations

1084
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:12,470
sorry no okay

1085
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:14,180
like I mean we had this we had a

1086
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:16,580
discussion about defacements and

1087
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,279
denial-of-service yesterday but I am

1088
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:22,250
very skeptical that this is something

1089
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,780
that will have a big impact but I'm

1090
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,710
happy to tell for discussion about this

1091
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:30,320
afterwards Thanks

1092
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:34,070
thanks for mentioning false balance and

1093
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:37,400
the media in the role do you see any way

1094
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:41,570
to interfere at that point that false

1095
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,910
balance I mean one of the things is that

1096
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:47,330
I was working as a journalist in this

1097
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:51,799
area and right now I'm mostly not I'm

1098
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:56,660
mostly doing IT stuff so I mean yeah you

1099
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:59,150
can try to become a journalist or try to

1100
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,710
influence the media like that and I mean

1101
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:02,390
what is the what is the mechanism that

1102
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:08,390
drives this false balance why do they

1103
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:10,190
still do that I mean I okay so I mean

1104
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:13,900
there's this general tendency that

1105
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:18,740
journalists want to be balanced which

1106
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:20,540
sounds kind of reasonable unless you go

1107
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:23,060
to things where we talk about facts

1108
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:27,080
right we also don't balance that like

1109
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:29,210
did the moon landing happening but so I

1110
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,130
think there's there's not this

1111
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:33,500
recognition that this is not a matter of

1112
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:37,100
opinion that we're talking about facts

1113
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,290
here but there's also like I mean this

1114
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,259
kind of a politicized issue and you feel

1115
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:43,880
like okay now we did the Green Party

1116
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,100
friendly article and now we need the

1117
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,280
other party friendly article which is

1118
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:51,350
prone things like that I have the

1119
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,540
suspicion that it's because they want to

1120
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:56,690
create a debate that is emotionally

1121
00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:01,190
enraging yeah I mean that author I mean

1122
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:03,800
that's also what we see with the with

1123
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:06,050
that the right-wing movement has much

1124
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,299
more representation and in hacking the

1125
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:12,059
me

1126
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:17,160
I mean isn't that a way I mean I'm not

1127
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:19,499
absolutist but I mean it's facts are

1128
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:23,038
difficult like they are boring they're

1129
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:29,609
not nice stories they're I don't have

1130
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:31,140
all the answers on the on the back of

1131
00:57:29,609 --> 00:57:35,160
the comment about that we went to the

1132
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:38,069
moon pretty much in the past and a 100

1133
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,348
years all major advances major projects

1134
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:42,719
he happened because of competitions

1135
00:57:40,349 --> 00:57:45,150
between countries more or less all the

1136
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:48,299
way from colonization to going to the

1137
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:51,660
move to even building the internet do

1138
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:53,579
you feel that we could ever get to a

1139
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:57,359
place like this again where actually we

1140
00:57:53,579 --> 00:58:00,539
can start competing with something to go

1141
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:03,779
somewhere or actually our connectedness

1142
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:06,059
today which also makes Wars impossible

1143
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:09,119
makes it impossible for a structure we

1144
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:11,579
put down our iPhones and build something

1145
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,529
okay so with the competition between

1146
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:15,929
countries you have this kind of this

1147
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:20,849
problem that if you do something to

1148
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:24,150
reduce emissions it's it's an advantage

1149
00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:26,130
for the whole world so there's not a big

1150
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,019
incentive for a singer country to do

1151
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:30,779
more than the others well it's kind of

1152
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:35,549
this tragedy of the Commons like I'm not

1153
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:37,670
an economist but so I feel it's I mean

1154
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:40,259
of course there is competition about

1155
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:42,229
solar energy there is competition about

1156
00:58:40,259 --> 00:58:46,799
electric cars although I would prefer

1157
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:49,769
less cars but so I think this

1158
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:52,640
competition can help in some areas but

1159
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:55,399
for the overall issue it feels the

1160
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,719
incentives are not aligned with that

1161
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:02,039
because there's no incentive for one

1162
00:58:57,719 --> 00:59:04,859
country to be the climate leader all

1163
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:06,959
right next question please you don't

1164
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:09,170
have to answer but what do you think

1165
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:09,169
will happen

1166
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:18,970
yeah no I I mean okay but like I feel

1167
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:21,820
there will be a point where it's so

1168
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:24,490
obvious that we have a problem that we

1169
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:26,230
will discuss this in a different way the

1170
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:30,250
problem is just it will probably at a

1171
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:31,650
point where our options are limited and

1172
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:39,420
we may have a debate about

1173
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:39,420
geoengineering or whatever Thanks please

1174
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:48,510
for instance one example if so Z level

1175
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,800
would rise by 3 meters just tomorrow

1176
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:56,380
everybody would know that we have a

1177
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:58,900
problem so in my opinion when do we know

1178
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,390
that we really have a problem and this

1179
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,880
comes to the masses and everybody sees

1180
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,500
oh something is really going wrong so we

1181
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,590
need to do something I think this is the

1182
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,840
first key thing when we will start

1183
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:14,290
acting I mean I don't think this is a

1184
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:16,510
one point in time issue and I think we

1185
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:18,759
are already seeing that I mean there's

1186
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:22,060
definitely a connection between we had

1187
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,980
this crazy summer last year and then the

1188
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,840
topic came and then the Humber forest

1189
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:29,320
was in the news and then the Green Party

1190
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,530
grew and so there is already something

1191
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,869
happening where you clearly see a

1192
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:37,780
connection between events unfolding and

1193
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:40,600
more people caring about the topic it's

1194
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,310
not enough yet we know that but and but

1195
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,750
I don't know where the critical point

1196
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,070
will be very can you have really a

1197
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:52,810
discussion about doing something

1198
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:54,880
seriously ok so ok we have one more

1199
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:57,160
questions for one more question from the

1200
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:01,030
audience please do Fourier talk and also

1201
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:04,720
the other one things I was wondering I'm

1202
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:06,790
thinking a lot right now about also the

1203
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,390
media coverage that you mentioned and

1204
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:13,529
I'm from Austria and in the last months

1205
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:17,140
I had this feeling that it was not and

1206
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:20,980
not a downplaying of the effects but

1207
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:24,578
like more a hysteria so

1208
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:27,309
there is like climate crisis everywhere

1209
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:29,950
and it's like catastrophic scenarios

1210
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:33,579
everywhere but it's in a kind of science

1211
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:36,970
fiction way sometimes so it's it's maybe

1212
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:40,950
even overdone and also I cannot recall

1213
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:44,769
anymore where but I read that also the

1214
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:47,710
also the the crisis version of what is

1215
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:52,058
happening like in the story to tell that

1216
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:55,059
it's all going to is not having an

1217
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:59,140
effect because it makes the masses too

1218
01:01:55,059 --> 01:02:00,579
helpless because it's too big and so

1219
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:06,098
this is what I'm thinking right now

1220
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:09,239
about also in what I do how how there

1221
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:11,920
would be a way to communicate

1222
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:14,499
not with downplaying but also not with

1223
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,910
this extreme hysteria but telling how

1224
01:02:14,499 --> 01:02:20,980
bad it is yeah without shocking people

1225
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:23,019
so much that they just keep doing what

1226
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,759
they're doing because there is no point

1227
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:27,640
in it something like that and I was

1228
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:35,559
wondering if you have a comment on that

1229
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:37,868
or maybe like a third way between so I

1230
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:40,210
mean one problem is that the hysteria

1231
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:41,920
and the what sounds like science fiction

1232
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:46,029
is often what we can read out of the

1233
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:48,339
science so III don't think it's literate

1234
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:50,230
to say this is this you yeah when this

1235
01:02:48,339 --> 01:02:55,839
is the prediction from the science we

1236
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:57,640
have also I feel like I mean extinction

1237
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,220
rebellion does this very extreme with

1238
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:03,819
these shocking messages and like they

1239
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:06,519
are growing like crazy like in Berlin I

1240
01:03:03,819 --> 01:03:08,529
I get kind of a newsletter from them

1241
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:15,399
there were they they do something every

1242
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:17,470
day and so I mean we we kind of enter in

1243
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,509
an area which is psychology and there

1244
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:22,538
are also some debates whether which kind

1245
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:25,200
of messaging works although I have a lot

1246
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:30,700
of doubts about psychology as a science

1247
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:34,029
that's a different topic but my feeling

1248
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:36,700
is that these shocking messages and this

1249
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:40,650
really like staying within the science

1250
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:44,710
but telling the science how bad it is if

1251
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:46,269
looks to me like it's working at least

1252
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:51,549
it's working better than what we did

1253
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:54,129
before so you would say that like

1254
01:03:51,549 --> 01:03:57,549
everything that is going out as long as

1255
01:03:54,130 --> 01:04:02,670
it stays as much as the current facts as

1256
01:03:57,549 --> 01:04:05,650
possible is should be a good thing right

1257
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:09,249
yeah I think it's it's I mean there are

1258
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:11,319
occasionally situations where there was

1259
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:11,618
for example an article by a journalist

1260
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:14,739
called

1261
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:16,390
David Wallace wells which was in The New

1262
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:19,079
Yorker and it was criticized a lot

1263
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:23,288
because it was based on a scenario that

1264
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:27,519
is has some assumptions that are not

1265
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:30,789
very realistic so there are occasionally

1266
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:33,399
situations where people overdo things

1267
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:35,440
and people are going like it's maybe

1268
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,599
still within the science but it's not

1269
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,390
very realistic and I think it's

1270
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:44,440
reasonable to have that discussion but

1271
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:46,440
also this is not very often and what we

1272
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:53,829
see much more often is the downplaying

1273
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:54,819
so thank you okay so thank you for your

1274
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:57,489
questions

1275
01:04:54,819 --> 01:05:03,210
I want you to give I know a big round

1276
01:04:57,489 --> 01:05:03,210
applause again please thank you

1277
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,039
[Music]

1278
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,020
you
