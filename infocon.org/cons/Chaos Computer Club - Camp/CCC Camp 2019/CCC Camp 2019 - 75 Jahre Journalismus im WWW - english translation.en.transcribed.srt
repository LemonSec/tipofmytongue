2
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,930
it's the untold stories

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,750
I know dear shoulder by internal anemia

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:26,800
all serum privada even delayed since

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,710
we're going to see a slight slideshow of

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,049
the from the tooth journalist standing

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,580
next to me and it's going to be IT

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,320
history in the parts that they haven't

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,190
published so far we have get there

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:43,059
boyars who is a journalist and has been

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:46,170
that since 86 and one of the things he

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:49,180
writes is the Bosphorus vert column at

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:58,239
Heiser de and Garrett Miller who is a

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:01:02,949
hacker that the speaker good beginning

15
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,048
that let me start and let me explain why

16
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:08,530
we're here

17
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:12,310
during lost camp we happened to meet for

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:16,330
the first time Peter and me wrote for

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:21,610
the same newspaper in the 80s Detlef has

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:27,130
been there for ages and we met we spent

21
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:30,880
the entire afternoon right next to where

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:36,490
we stand now as well and we simply

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:39,009
chatted we had fun - Aslam and initially

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,580
there were five people next to us and

25
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,440
there were ten and after two hours there

26
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,580
was a crowd of thirty people listening

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,190
and so we told ourselves we're going to

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,130
give a talk at the next camp and those

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:58,720
of you who say grandad is speaking about

30
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,839
the crypto walks crypto Wars gonna have

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,230
to deal with me so yes we decided we

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,000
would have to come up on stage here

33
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,640
Peter unfortunately couldn't make it due

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,140
to an illness he's doing fine but I

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:17,738
think he's exhausted after the

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:21,700
documentary they filmed with him on Val

37
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,650
Holland and that explains this like the

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,238
absurd

39
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,129
picture so um Detlef bottles can take it

40
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,500
from here with the first episode of the

41
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,530
untold story

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,319
it's an untold story because there were

43
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,970
certain things that we research back in

44
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,970
the days but we couldn't publish them

45
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:58,828
does anybody know this person this is

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:03,590
Frank it was used to be deputy president

47
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:07,379
of the CCC and became president later on

48
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:13,560
and the reason I'm showing you Frank is

49
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:17,220
this beside the dot enjoyed a magazine

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,700
that was published on paper he also

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,459
founded the shyest II and distributed it

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,410
in various networks for example in do

53
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:34,109
you net where it could be found under

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:38,489
the command board the CCC press and this

55
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:40,620
electronic newspaper or good made by

56
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,879
hackers talked about cryptography and

57
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,609
this is going to be one of the main

58
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:51,569
subjects today yeah don't you dare yes

59
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,879
because crypto is back on the table with

60
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:59,819
the debates on the restrictions on

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:04,709
cryptography issue of Odyssey ended with

62
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:07,649
this imprint which is what really

63
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:12,150
defines the CCC today the entire

64
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:16,769
humanity is I'm sorry there's any of you

65
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,989
know this person it's good lawyer who is

66
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:25,379
holding a t-shirt why is he holding it

67
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:29,489
the given that he is the person who ran

68
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:34,530
the Geo net mail system which you can

69
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:38,340
see in the background and when this

70
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:42,210
picture was taken he was named honorary

71
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,729
president of the Chaos Computer Club now

72
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,359
there are other people standing in his

73
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,960
place you might know them better handy

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,379
on one side foul on the other side and

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,628
Gunther loyal with the Diploma it

76
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:01,889
certifies that he has become unreal

77
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:06,409
president why did he become that he

78
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:08,610
founded a club in association or

79
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:13,050
telecommunication and everybody who

80
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:15,060
wanted to do things with data on the

81
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,889
Internet could become member of this

82
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,250
association they had to submit an

83
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:23,639
application and when you did that you

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:28,289
were you had legal protection for your

85
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:32,279
mailbox and this made him honorary

86
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,990
president this is the first part of my

87
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:40,139
stories this happened in the year of

88
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:46,589
1988 and I will jump ahead to the years

89
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:48,930
of 89 and 90 at felishj I am was newly

90
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:53,360
employed at the Austrian standard me

91
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:59,789
newspaper I got my own column on media

92
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:04,620
and I often went on holiday and thanks

93
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:08,969
God we had television and the news over

94
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:12,300
here so I could reports while I was here

95
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:15,690
without he without the company being any

96
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:20,150
of the wiser and I learned one of these

97
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,190
things the newspaper had three of them

98
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,620
to achieve a laptop she had three

99
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,250
Toshiba laptops in black-and-white with

100
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:33,540
two floppy drives one for the operating

101
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:37,200
system and one for memory now I had

102
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:42,240
and I had this acoustic coupler and that

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,460
allowed me to send over my text so we

104
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,810
were on the Ramstein Air Base and we

105
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:52,430
were there quite often and we said we

106
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:56,210
would go to the airbase and my friend

107
00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:01,530
axel was there with a lot of punks and

108
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:03,120
that's how things got started we were

109
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,679
completely stoned from the very

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,230
beginning and in these highest fears and

111
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,120
behind us the military police was

112
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,590
constantly watching what we were doing

113
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,080
we weren't really planning on doing

114
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,969
anything talking about the cops be usual

115
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,180
and I had my acoustic coupler coupler

116
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:29,220
and a laptop and then I saw this

117
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,250
telephone base and I thought I could try

118
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,100
field reporting with this crap wind

119
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:39,540
again it didn't so I entered the disease

120
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:42,140
and told the guys give me some cover

121
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,380
make sure that the cops can't see me

122
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,630
duty so I went I went in three and five

123
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:53,460
one marked pieces put this on the

124
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:56,850
coupler and when it started making the

125
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,669
usual noises the sending the action for

126
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:02,700
the in connection is gusta co-produced

127
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:06,420
Duluth the acoustic coupler flew through

128
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:12,719
the air and I was thrown backwards out

129
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:16,590
of the telephone booth found myself next

130
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:21,270
to two american military policemen who

131
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,969
took me away and I had to answer

132
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,299
questions for one hour I was completely

133
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:32,040
out of it I only had some slippers of

134
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,900
course no press card nothing and as I

135
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,490
was telling them I was drying feed

136
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,740
reporting so they let me go after one

137
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,710
hour because they'd Punk's were standing

138
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,409
outside and saying if it comes out it

139
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,470
doesn't come out soon we'll come in that

140
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,740
was

141
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,200
my first meeting with the German and

142
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,450
American police at the very time very

143
00:08:50,200 --> 00:09:01,450
same time and I hand over to Detlef I

144
00:08:52,450 --> 00:09:05,890
know a short English insert this is in

145
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:08,590
yellow because the company had yellow as

146
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:13,090
its color Lotus Notes

147
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:17,770
it was the Lotus color now we're in the

148
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:21,490
year 1996 and Lotus back then government

149
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:26,530
form had the so called ran the Salukis

150
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:29,830
Lotus government forum and a lotus

151
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:33,579
person stood up and said there is

152
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,850
information superiority and that is what

153
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,680
we have to use it was the time of the

154
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:44,830
Bosnian conflict and we'll tell manasa

155
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,280
which exactly that what we do and what

156
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,960
information we have about him and that

157
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,990
will make him see that we are much

158
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,450
stronger and he will desist and that

159
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:00,460
will prevent a war there was a lot of

160
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:03,070
applause for that but it turned out

161
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,170
quite differently my mother um called it

162
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,380
have to think back to the Kosovo

163
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,400
conflict where Milosevic simply didn't

164
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:15,070
hesitate at all he just kicked off that

165
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,420
war and this is my explanation from an

166
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,640
article knowledge management was

167
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,589
supposed to strengthen the German forces

168
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,420
as a peace corps but there was a

169
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:33,790
disadvantage Lotus Notes did encrypts

170
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:38,589
but not sufficiently for in a American

171
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:41,349
use they were using 128 bits but the

172
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,280
Europeans only received Lotus Notes with

173
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,680
a version a version that used 50 bits or

174
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,280
was it 56 that was important because the

175
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,939
German Authority had 60,000 licenses and

176
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,100
up to the year 2003 they were going to

177
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,580
equip

178
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:04,860
use 80,000 of these licenses for this

179
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:09,150
product that the software Bischoff

180
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,770
pseudonym and the minister or the

181
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,569
ministry or the civil servants

182
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:18,420
responsible for acquisition this was in

183
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,480
1997 went ahead and said this is

184
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,420
completely unacceptable to us if we are

185
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:29,220
going to use a software that the NSA can

186
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:36,060
control that is just not on for the

187
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:38,130
German military but he left open how

188
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,699
this was going to be secure but the

189
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,020
response clearly was no the the the

190
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,980
message clear was we want to be safe

191
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:50,189
from the NSA and it has to be said this

192
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,160
forum for NATO and the military

193
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,920
consultants was intended for NATO and

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,540
military consultants I wasn't going to

195
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,530
report I wasn't supposed to report on

196
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,240
this I went to the meeting about

197
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:06,510
information superiority where this

198
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,780
concept was discussed but I wasn't

199
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,600
admitted and just stayed in the room

200
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,550
after another talk and could hear and

201
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,550
and record and and take papers with me

202
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,640
that is another section I'm ain't going

203
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,600
to move back okay give it back to area

204
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:31,400
the key word is take papers with you

205
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:38,540
that will have a player role later on in

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:42,090
1995 and 96 February 1995 I went I

207
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,040
became a worldwide web enthusiast spent

208
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,080
three months there until one of my

209
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,010
friends showed me traceroute and other

210
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,310
commands and then I said just turn don't

211
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,600
tell me that this is all going to be

212
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:57,449
transmitted in clear text and he said

213
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,180
yes of course it is is all unclear and I

214
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,990
said are you crazy there is less safe

215
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,500
than a letter yes well he said we just

216
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,790
won't have time to read this all

217
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,300
transmits far too fast it's all growing

218
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,829
bandwidth is growing much faster than

219
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,770
storage capabilities so that's how they

220
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:25,420
convinced themselves and then in 1996 I

221
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,520
was presented an online magazine does

222
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,719
would even predict his battery which was

223
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,930
run by three techies and they simply ran

224
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,150
out of content they underestimated the

225
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:41,589
amount of work it takes to run such a

226
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:43,689
publication that it has to appear how

227
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:50,130
ABBA and that is a heap of work

228
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:53,140
so bidding cutest as a result from

229
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,330
merely entertaining magazine it was

230
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,980
swiftly converted to a civil-rights

231
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:03,670
magazine and in 1997 this magazine great

232
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,630
had was raided much like the raid on

233
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,430
CompuServe in munich this provider there

234
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,170
was raided and the servers were taken

235
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,089
out from away from the shelves where

236
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,780
they were running because they were

237
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:19,750
carrying Usenet groups and because

238
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:22,209
perhaps some something like 6 or

239
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:26,050
something appeared in there as well and

240
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,520
of course then we call this court on is

241
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,859
investigating on the internet caught on

242
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,829
being the famous Austrians had have a

243
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:38,770
crime series and the internet actually

244
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:41,140
in Austria for a whole night the

245
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,110
internet was simply reduced to zero

246
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,470
everything that was only in it on the

247
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:51,460
internet was taken down that had never

248
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,090
happened again okay and something else

249
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,840
we did

250
00:14:52,090 --> 00:15:00,490
if cryptography is a weapon then we will

251
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:05,880
start a weapons store this was supposed

252
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:12,300
to be an animated gif and we call this

253
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:15,160
we announced an award for clogged up

254
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:19,780
lines which didn't make many people

255
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:22,420
happy but people said well did I just oh

256
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,290
can you yourself that's my answer

257
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,439
to this

258
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,020
if someone tells me he hated to stop

259
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,920
something then I respond I wasn't gonna

260
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:35,740
say this I intended to say please yeah

261
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,670
just walk off but that's what I actually

262
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,790
did say so

263
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,490
Krita scense suddenly became a member of

264
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:47,680
the global Internet campaign the

265
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:51,280
magazine Taba and cryptography was the

266
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,739
sole topic all of a sudden and we're all

267
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,470
waiting until the first GUI version of

268
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,010
PGP would come out didn't exist at the

269
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,440
time that was a very fresh project on

270
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,840
the global internet Liberty campaign

271
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,860
mailing list you had everyone that had

272
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:12,760
rank and name worldwide it wasn't just

273
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:16,090
something small enacted and phthalo

274
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,520
everywhere they were looking for the

275
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,400
OECD recommendations for cryptography

276
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:26,560
which was in the last draft stages be an

277
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,300
I in Vienna that kamek Thani makes in

278
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,189
the land I will come to this in the next

279
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:37,030
section and see suddenly data protector

280
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:39,460
hunts Sega came to us he started in 1983

281
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,250
with protecting data he's one of the

282
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:48,970
very old core protect data privacy

283
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:54,460
activists and he came to me and put this

284
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:58,660
on my desk this year this the happiest a

285
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:01,240
tape up he had the OECD papers so much

286
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,910
everyone was looking for only suck hey

287
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,819
and I said wow where did you get these

288
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,800
hunts the thing as income factories are

289
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,980
confidential papers no one will get them

290
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,780
I'd st. agur introduced snake he gave me

291
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,230
the only person who had them wasn't

292
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,500
allowed to give them away help the tiger

293
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:24,400
kisser and Sega then said well I took it

294
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:28,209
from the chancellor's office in Austria

295
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,570
and I said what well I just went there

296
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:33,700
to doctor so-and-so who has something to

297
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,740
do with data protection and he had this

298
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,640
lying there and at the end of the talk

299
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,670
he said bye

300
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,220
the way doctor could you perhaps have a

301
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,640
look at this we don't really know what

302
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,800
to do with this we don't have the

303
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:54,910
knowledge and that's how the papers came

304
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:58,389
to me he had a Mac and he knew OCR so

305
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,190
these 120 pages were ocr'd and I proof

306
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:05,560
read the OCR which because it was very

307
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:07,330
buggy at the time so I knew I learned I

308
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,659
wrote learn see the papers because I

309
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,060
received it twice and the marshy garbage

310
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,250
this week and there was a lot of a

311
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,860
diplomatic rouse as a consequence and

312
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,020
for the second instance we published

313
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,270
this of mine and said this is a small

314
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,520
service for the delegates so that they

315
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:27,270
can access the document whenever they

316
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,300
want in electronic form

317
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,450
[Applause]

318
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:37,899
Yaron am here and we actually wrote

319
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,370
amendments to so that's my introduction

320
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:45,790
into the world of cryptography back to

321
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:48,129
death in 1997 we had a minister whose

322
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:53,470
name was cantor Manfred counter and he

323
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:56,130
gave a speech in Bonn on the federal

324
00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:03,550
Information Security offices conference

325
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:06,280
and What did he say he said in several

326
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:09,250
years the internet will not be

327
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:14,250
encrypting only normal data traffic but

328
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:21,400
even a regular phone course then this is

329
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:27,900
then we need regulation to prevent law

330
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:33,070
enforcement abilities for wiretapping

331
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:35,230
from being impossible so this would

332
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:39,159
essentially render the state powerless

333
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:43,320
so what else did he say it's very simple

334
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,320
this can be done by

335
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:52,920
giving by handing the encryption keys to

336
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,290
a state organization and using personal

337
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:00,790
organizational and legal measures to

338
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:04,570
prevent any ability for abuse this is

339
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,879
not about wiretapping we have to have

340
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:10,090
surveillance measures is what he said

341
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,840
and the honest citizen will deliver

342
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:16,510
their encryption keys he didn't stay in

343
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,840
office for long the very next year he

344
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:26,710
was replaced by a person from the free

345
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:35,770
Democratic Party and that was good a

346
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:38,830
very very sympathetic to the to private

347
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,260
companies he said we need strong crypto

348
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,409
another thing that I forgot ke Akua Baja

349
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:48,550
after this speech set up a mailing list

350
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:53,170
where everybody met and emailed back and

351
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:59,760
forth the papers they had among these

352
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:59,760
the Kanter speech and the mailing list

353
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,899
there was a certain shift in mentality

354
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,580
and zeitgeist because people didn't know

355
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,429
what the men in this was but this

356
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,559
mailing list was used to spread these

357
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:22,050
things and there was jubilation when

358
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:26,410
Cantor said this the American

359
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:29,889
organization should have access at any

360
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:32,260
time this is also true for foreign

361
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:36,700
entities this is unacceptable

362
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:39,100
because the technical measures to

363
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,190
protect yourselves with a strong

364
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,610
cryptographic method are freely

365
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:50,710
available in Germany boom we've defined

366
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,769
crypto as a legal measure both for

367
00:21:50,710 --> 00:22:00,999
private economy and

368
00:21:52,769 --> 00:22:03,389
individual citizens in 89 the in 99 the

369
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:08,200
federal government

370
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:12,129
lined out the cornerstones of the German

371
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,649
crypto policy they're very hard to find

372
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:17,289
on the Internet these days at least the

373
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:18,539
ministry for the economy doesn't have

374
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:22,239
them

375
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:26,859
Calvin's homepage which is ancient still

376
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:30,099
has them form it's got the last revision

377
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:32,649
of these cornerstones and he froze them

378
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:36,399
and it will stay there the reason I

379
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:43,258
mentioned this is that it's boutique or

380
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:46,059
the previous cam netzpolitik.org sent a

381
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:51,279
question to the government Anderson what

382
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:56,619
about crypto and the answer was the

383
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:58,840
politic for normal was in 2015 that the

384
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:03,070
cornerstones of German crypto policy

385
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:13,478
from 1999 still apply and strong crypto

386
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:16,389
is legal yeah does last this was it that

387
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:22,389
was the vasana arrangement as a picture

388
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:24,668
of it and let's start like this that's

389
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:29,649
easy the vasana office which is the

390
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:32,919
office where krypter was held hostage it

391
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:33,988
was the office that defined its broad

392
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:38,099
restrictions

393
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:40,419
Theoden King gross and successor to the

394
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,149
sanctions on Russia when you were no

395
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:45,429
longer allowed to export computers to

396
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:48,459
Russia and it contained the munitions

397
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:51,009
list so material that can be weaponized

398
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,840
and that included cryptography and of

399
00:23:51,009 --> 00:24:01,389
course we were aghast at this and global

400
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:04,478
internet Liberty campaign you see I saw

401
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:06,040
that this office is in Vienna it's

402
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:09,790
behind the hotel dressed

403
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:12,970
which is a very fancy fancy hotel next

404
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:15,879
to the state of the vasana of his is at

405
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:18,280
the backside of this my brother was very

406
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,940
much into secret services he knew about

407
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:25,030
this and he told me that this was where

408
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:29,020
the British Secret Service had their

409
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,730
offices after the war and I thought I

410
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:34,660
should be able to have access to this

411
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:41,890
and the Canadians and Mike Wattenberg

412
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:45,280
knew two people from who well

413
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:48,700
bureaucrats who had passed these this

414
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:53,020
arrangement and I gave them a call and

415
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:59,190
said I'm a reporter and I noticed that

416
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,190
in 1996 there was one message or one

417
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,150
notification that this office was being

418
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:09,879
opened and that was it nobody move it

419
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:12,070
here and I asked the others do you know

420
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,990
anybody who works there yes there's one

421
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:18,010
who he works for the telecoms industry

422
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:20,590
he's from Canada he's not a spook yes so

423
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,330
it was a meeting point for military

424
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:27,100
secret services but he's not to speak

425
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:32,050
and I gave them call the label is happy

426
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:35,199
I when I was still writing for ten

427
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,870
episodes and not features and so I said

428
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,720
I'm a reporter I would like to visit you

429
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:44,469
we'd like to have a look people can't

430
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,510
really paint a picture of this and there

431
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,850
are rumors going about so we could use

432
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:54,250
it as an opportunity to direct them so

433
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:55,689
they said yes come along and so we we

434
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,440
had a look and I know what the

435
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:01,800
architecture there is like and it's true

436
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:08,010
they live in the Bristol hotel and

437
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:10,750
there's the company there's a path right

438
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,820
into the building they don't really use

439
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,230
the door they also have their own garage

440
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,710
with their own security and you can only

441
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:22,110
get upstairs with their guarded lift

442
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,539
and I'll show you what it looks like

443
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,149
that was the office where cryptography

444
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,710
was being held hostage

445
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:34,139
does this da-jung Stewart that's the

446
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:37,320
entrance door malestrazza 14 on the

447
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,799
right hand side is the state opera and

448
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,620
this is their doorbell that at the

449
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,889
bottom is the Afghan consulate and the

450
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,059
personnel office is known here because

451
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:56,250
it is top seven and top eight even today

452
00:26:50,059 --> 00:27:00,779
this was it was the same in 98 so I went

453
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:07,440
in went out great an article on Vassar

454
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:09,659
now planned a taunting I was giving a

455
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,020
speech on this topic anyway in Frankfort

456
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:17,760
at the Heinrich böll Foundation

457
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:20,940
that's where I met vow sacked and we

458
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,770
spent ages until 3:00 in the morning we

459
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,480
were talking about shortwave and I said

460
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:31,649
ham radio operators are arseholes

461
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,679
and he said no not everybody and I told

462
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:37,260
him about how I was not allowed to do

463
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,590
the exam because I had been intercepting

464
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:44,340
illegal things they didn't allow me to

465
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:52,470
take the exam the next morning I flew

466
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:55,199
home I had had a saw had I was boarding

467
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:59,690
the plane on the other side of the Gabby

468
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,950
and in the last minute last minute this

469
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:06,360
businesswoman in was coming along and

470
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:08,820
sat down next to me and I was wondering

471
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,139
what he was doing in the smoker seat

472
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,240
yes it's moose words and she told me

473
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,950
about how she had to sit next to the

474
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:23,640
galley because he had medicine that

475
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:25,169
needed to be cold chilled and it was

476
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,149
really apart from that she would like a

477
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:30,299
cigarette and I was wondering what she

478
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:32,039
wanted for me and I gave her a cigarette

479
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:35,999
what indeed obscene that she smoked it

480
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,549
and I saw that she's not a smoker had

481
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:41,519
sneaked Ellen get dog didn't take a very

482
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:44,459
long time until we started talking then

483
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,549
I asked her it's done a green fleek why

484
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:50,639
she was flying to Vienna and she told me

485
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:53,609
if we had trained Osito she's late not

486
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:57,869
unless she's leading a session at the

487
00:28:53,609 --> 00:29:01,289
bassinger office mr. Rossi came after

488
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:06,238
you know what I did Shawn it was I was

489
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:08,999
slightly surprised the saga and this is

490
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:11,519
anguish poor great recipe for you if you

491
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,349
ever get spoken to like this the

492
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,789
communicate communicate you're hearing

493
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:20,939
the communication I gave a incredibly

494
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:24,839
brutal history from my private life

495
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:30,109
where I made a fool of myself damn bad

496
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,109
CL shake and that she was astonished

497
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:37,639
this was it because I did it

498
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:40,440
instinctively and that was nice the lady

499
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:44,728
didn't dare mention it at the time

500
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,609
because everybody who didn't understand

501
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:49,229
my reporting and said I was paranoid and

502
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:54,478
these are conspiracy theories and

503
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:57,359
whatnot and if I'd then say that I was I

504
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:59,639
was in the bassinet office another time

505
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,739
with the person from the Electronic

506
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:03,988
Frontier Foundation and I asked the two

507
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:08,969
people who were there one of them from

508
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:10,169
the German secret service was not very

509
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:14,299
nice to me the other was a friendly

510
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:19,259
Canadian and I often do you know

511
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:23,418
Louisa Maria : from Puerto Rico I lifted

512
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:27,209
them like this and they said yes we know

513
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:30,869
Louisa who is from the State Department

514
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:33,059
isn't she and I said it's because she

515
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:36,089
sat next to me on the plane and started

516
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,059
talking and talking to me approach and

517
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:40,950
the Canadian asked me if I was surprised

518
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,870
by the directness of the approach and

519
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:51,360
smiled very kindly over to Detlef

520
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:52,739
that's not known only in 1999 there was

521
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,918
a conference of the equal Internet

522
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,379
project which I couldn't find him online

523
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,740
anymore but this is the folder for the

524
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:05,248
conference and that was the main sponsor

525
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:09,059
all the big COO photography whoever was

526
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:12,509
there you can see this extract from the

527
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:14,668
participant list and the person that you

528
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,669
were always calling with was there who

529
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:21,869
was that and they talked about things

530
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:26,759
like key escrow and Americans wanted to

531
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:31,980
establish a key escrow procedure that

532
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:36,269
was a private conference in London there

533
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,399
was a photography prohibition I did try

534
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:41,749
to subvert that without a flash of

535
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,639
course because the OECD guidelines

536
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:48,509
suddenly airlie had published them of

537
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:51,330
course all participants had them and and

538
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:56,279
were given them these guidelines now and

539
00:31:51,330 --> 00:32:00,539
they were supposed to be discussed and a

540
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:02,100
statement everyone had a statement early

541
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:06,200
sounded from the economic economic

542
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:09,299
mystery ministry for Germany he he

543
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,009
supported the ethical position we will

544
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:15,299
not make he escrow of the economy need

545
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:17,639
strong crypto the OECD person there had

546
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:22,350
compiled these papers was then giving

547
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:26,699
the presentation and the Speaker of the

548
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:31,110
British communication Ministry tried to

549
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:34,470
explain key escrow as a technology that

550
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:37,229
was friendly towards civil society that

551
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:40,649
could be rolled out we have a funding

552
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,659
and from that conference I was not

553
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:47,639
allowed to take photos but I was allowed

554
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:49,740
to write about it so as a journalist in

555
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,869
Google now but when you're out we were

556
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,720
supposed to make the key escrow

557
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,870
procedure known and favored with the

558
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,710
public

559
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:01,989
another advisor and now I will move take

560
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:03,340
it very different step and hand back to

561
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:07,840
air as you have another slide on this

562
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,870
yes now this is a small story how in

563
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,770
2001 in the European telecommunications

564
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:18,969
standards Institute I became a persona

565
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:22,389
non grata I had published the OECD

566
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:25,929
papers at Aleppo lists and others still

567
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:28,980
in hope all papers and and and the this

568
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:32,980
was just requirements to the cops

569
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,520
comms leader by the cops - what telecoms

570
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,890
how they were supposed to set things up

571
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,200
so that eavesdropping would be possible

572
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,309
and recording and now this landed in the

573
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,549
European telecommunications standards

574
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:48,490
Institute and that then was handed over

575
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:50,110
to these security working group they

576
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,899
didn't even call it lawful interception

577
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:57,969
at the time so I was I saw there that

578
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:00,639
there all the people in there allegedly

579
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:05,770
were part of Industry but in fact they

580
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,840
had they had they put forward secret

581
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,940
service positions much against the

582
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,969
interests of Industry and the head robin

583
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,760
cape was most conspicuous there so I

584
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:20,500
thought that's impossible he can't be

585
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,690
from Telecom then calls for this and

586
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,639
that to be surveilled these will

587
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,849
undercover people and no one admitted

588
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,089
where they came from they're all you

589
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:34,649
know ik ministries regulators of things

590
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:38,109
like that all from private companies the

591
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:40,388
whole group was set up in this way many

592
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:43,629
people were in there and all of them

593
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:46,089
were not what they pretended to be so I

594
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:50,520
simply published all their names that

595
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:53,889
was a four part publication at City the

596
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,910
McKnight C dossiers I put all the names

597
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:59,619
in there without without mercy and I had

598
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,680
a very good source because a certain

599
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:04,599
telecoms company had no interest on in

600
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,450
the HC interfaces because they had

601
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,800
different ones and didn't want to change

602
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,500
their network

603
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,300
so there was a kind of support and I

604
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:19,340
always published it as soon as I got it

605
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:22,460
and then these people got enraged booty

606
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:25,420
of course I provoked this I took their

607
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,860
names and said come on people

608
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:33,050
take the amount dissent does anyone know

609
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:36,110
these people I will soon like to publish

610
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:39,560
non-public documents and if anyone can

611
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:42,230
give me any information will give will

612
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,730
be given inside so someone from the BBC

613
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,290
wrote to me and said I was in University

614
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,150
with them they were always close to the

615
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:53,470
state and this and that and that guy I

616
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,790
knew so I gave him those documents

617
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:59,270
conference scrambling for safety in

618
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:02,210
London 2000 first speaker Ross Anderson

619
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:08,240
and second me Ross about crypto and me

620
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:11,270
about rank as soon as I came in that

621
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,640
British journalist said careful your

622
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:21,170
friends are here they were up in the

623
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:23,420
gallery the five of them and I'm not

624
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,760
positive and everyone saw that they were

625
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,670
together and I received the next stash

626
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,800
of faithlessness the next batch and I

627
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,780
noticed that there was a full-page does

628
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,340
he about me in them that was funny and

629
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,870
of course it said this document is not

630
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,120
to be made publicly available so I

631
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:47,390
immediately took it and put it up there

632
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:50,839
and at crypto Diaghilev

633
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:54,049
that's where they were trapped in these

634
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:57,380
tries and trap because they had all

635
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,930
their names all spread out it may not be

636
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,170
is it for all the ones that I had been

637
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:05,210
so mean to publish so I took those

638
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,370
document and we published published it

639
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:10,370
on film again and suddenly they had

640
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:13,640
announced their own names and then the

641
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:16,520
accusation came that I was conducting

642
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,190
harassment come on

643
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,090
there are spooks in there working under

644
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:25,240
false ID and I

645
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:27,640
just publish the names and I am the one

646
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,799
that's scaring them come on I'm not

647
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,830
scaring anyone ever facially that was

648
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,090
just ridiculous and then since it off

649
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:39,730
get common today got the idea that

650
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:43,090
documents were not all non published

651
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,560
document because these were all then all

652
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,090
these internal documents had been

653
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,590
published on Krypton that they hadn't

654
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:52,540
seen so that made them that annoyed him

655
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,070
even more and they wanted tend to use

656
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,940
copyright to get at me and and then

657
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:00,880
these idiots suddenly noticed that a

658
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,820
standardization Institute's is work

659
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:08,080
works on open standards and that open

660
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:10,570
standards everyone has to sign their

661
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,279
copyright interests away by working on

662
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:14,590
this open standards I had an interest in

663
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,080
those and without them the net cannot

664
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,960
grow so they realized that the

665
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,830
copyrights thing wasn't going to really

666
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,340
work and from then on somehow everything

667
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:30,910
somehow was over they didn't want me

668
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,800
anymore at all I understood and for

669
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:35,859
their pleasure

670
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,440
why did this alien presented them the 5g

671
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,480
surveillance talk because there's some

672
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,540
of these people are still in there and I

673
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,550
say this is a small service to these

674
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,529
people themselves so that they can see

675
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:54,430
what it what nonsense they are doing

676
00:38:48,530 --> 00:39:00,280
[Applause]

677
00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:03,190
believe that fear to sum up we thought

678
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,220
we'd take a leap back into the past

679
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,260
where we were confronted with this

680
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:16,020
technology for the first time when I was

681
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:18,570
finishing my studies I transferred to

682
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:23,520
institute an institute in Bengali and

683
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:30,190
Paris where we published this

684
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:33,730
publication and the two chairman of this

685
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:39,540
institute whom you can see on this cover

686
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:42,970
as the editor and I know is a

687
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:49,120
fascinating guy had a lot of fun with

688
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:52,810
him and he's Belgian and he was Minister

689
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:57,000
for culture and agenda in Chile and

690
00:39:52,810 --> 00:40:00,370
inside the aspera of the Chilean left

691
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,780
gathered around him regularly and I was

692
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:10,049
among them and met a guy his name is the

693
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,750
bandipur but he turned out to be a

694
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:20,410
German designer from TBN in South West

695
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:24,220
Germany and together with he I talked

696
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:26,710
about cabinet cybernetics he's wrong

697
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:33,790
because that was his passion he designed

698
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:35,600
this dream as a as a central central

699
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:40,190
differential design

700
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:47,330
Gillian operating center of the Chilean

701
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:50,930
economy and this was where they would

702
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:53,420
determine the production numbers for the

703
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,450
Chilean economy and this would be

704
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,630
distributed throughout the country

705
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:05,419
computer network he developed developed

706
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:07,400
all this and this is what the individual

707
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:13,310
screens looked like I mean this is a

708
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:15,710
mock-up but bonds Ebert tried to develop

709
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:19,990
a system for a cybernetic planned

710
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:22,550
economy and it's fascinating what I was

711
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:27,040
allowed to learn back in the days that

712
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,040
was mine production that was in 82 83

713
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:34,580
and that's where I got my first computer

714
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:38,030
as well thank you Detlef so it doesn't

715
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,850
that deep in 2000 I got a visit from

716
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:45,260
Nicky Hager from New Zealand you know

717
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:48,770
who is he children's can die in Slovak

718
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:52,120
he got started on the Echelon standard

719
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:56,509
standard in 96 by re-engineering the

720
00:41:52,120 --> 00:42:00,680
entire network starting from the Wi-Fi

721
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:03,080
edges on station and he searched for the

722
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,359
communication satellites along the

723
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,130
equator and said there has to be one on

724
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,390
the center and another on Madeira

725
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,800
otherwise you couldn't get them palomito

726
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,629
school that's what started the

727
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,890
investigation in the European Parliament

728
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:21,740
in 2000 and he came up to me Nicky Hager

729
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:25,270
because his name is not Nicky Hager his

730
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:29,810
name is Nicky Hager and his dad was

731
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:32,720
Viennese until 38 and the son came back

732
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:35,810
and I knew him from the mailing list and

733
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,649
said come come to me you can stay at my

734
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:42,710
place I have a huge house in the

735
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:44,630
countryside he came with his daughter we

736
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,150
talked about God in the world and he

737
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,020
gave me documents he told me things I

738
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,870
haven't gotten as he didn't be told

739
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,220
things I didn't know and then we started

740
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,109
talking about shortwaves

741
00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:02,490
the same as way The Vow back in the day

742
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:04,980
and I said no he said as he kept

743
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:09,330
intercepted to all these telecoms and I

744
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,010
got replies from all of them because the

745
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:15,120
engineers had the same hobbies and

746
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:17,010
nobody knew that I was only 16 they

747
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,730
thought I was a telecoms engineer the

748
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:22,320
same as then the kingdom so I got for

749
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,660
example this from the Kingdom of Saudi

750
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,840
Arabia where they wrote what kind of

751
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:30,420
antennas they had and why they were

752
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:36,840
transmitting or the US Coast Guard sent

753
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:38,670
me a really nice letter or dr. baby

754
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,980
except yeah he asked you have anything

755
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:45,450
from museum and I said yes one that was

756
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:48,090
the last thing I got because I moved to

757
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,890
a different place where antennae were no

758
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:51,810
longer an option and this was a hand

759
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:55,910
type letter from the communications

760
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:59,790
engineer of the Naval Station where you

761
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:01,279
eerie Rangi he started laughing Nicky

762
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:04,440
Hager started laughing

763
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,950
Dax Givens that's right yeah wish me

764
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:11,180
good px he was from the same trade as we

765
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:13,759
and he thought I was a telecoms engineer

766
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,830
even though I was still at school

767
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,120
Nicky Hager burst out laughing and said

768
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:23,190
this isn't possible

769
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:26,190
