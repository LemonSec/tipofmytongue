in the field of privacy as there are men

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,969
the truth is that women experience

their backgrounds may be diverse the one

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,729
thing that they all share is that

40
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,289

41
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,569

privacy so I want to dig a little bit

59
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,050
more into that Kaitlyn as a senior

60
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,090
privacy fellow can you tell us a little

61
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,920
bit more about your path and how working

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,960
in government shaped it and got you to

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,510
where you are today sure thank you so

64
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,790
much and first let me just say it's it's

65
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,430
quite the honor to be sitting here with

66
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,460
both of you to two leaders at the ia pp

67
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,210
that I just love working with so my

68
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,360
background in government so I recently

69
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,350
joined us you all know the ia PP about

70
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,650
six months ago after just about ten

71
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,290
years working on privacy for the US

72
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,800
government and so about 10 years ago I

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,100
was interviewing for a job at the u.s.

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,840
international trade administration in

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,420
trade policy which is what I wanted to

76
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,360
focus on and I interviewed with this

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,550
wonderful female leader in privacy

78
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,920
Kristin Jensi who heads up the digital

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,830
office of digital services industries at

80
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,040
the Department of Commerce and she

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,540
basically said you should come work for

82
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,570
us you should work on privacy and

83
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,310
cross-border data flows and I said

84
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,920
that's intriguing but you know I don't

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,700
know anything about privacy and she said

86
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,160
that's right we can teach you that um

87
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,870
and I promise privacy is going to be big

88
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,420
okay so lucky for me I I took her up on

89
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,530
that and started out working on privacy

90
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,480
and helping us companies comply with

91
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,160
foreign data protection laws and so over

92
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,750
ten years I basically covered every

93
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,840
region of the world doing privacy from

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,070
this trade angle at some point during

95
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,200
that span I had the good fortune of

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,579
working on the OECD rewrite of the

97
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,330
privacy guidelines so they they revamped

98
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,400
their privacy guidelines in 2013 and

99
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,070
that's where I met O'Meara today he held

100
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,960
the pen on that rewrite so that was kind

101
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,060
of my first introduction to someone who

102
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,210
now is a leader here at the IEP as well

103
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,680
the last

104
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,080
five years of my time I covered the EU

105
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,150
specifically I was involved in privacy

106
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,910
shield negotiations and then served as

107
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,470
the first privacy shield director so met

108
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,960
some awesome people along the way and I

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,150
think what kind of brought me to the ia

110
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:02,199
PP was engaging with IPP leaders and and

111
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,240
staff at the conferences around the

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,039
world and just really feeling like hey

113
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,650
the folks the folks here are are doing

114
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,630
some great work in terms of building

115
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,970
awareness and supporting the privacy

116
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,470
profession and so after after ten years

117
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,030
I thought okay I'm ready for a change

118
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,219
and so it kind of brought me here to IPP

119
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,130
all right well so I'm at the IEP P for

120
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,690
many of the same reasons that Caitlin is

121
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,550
which is it just seemed like a cool

122
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,949
place to work and it also seemed like

123
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,740
unlike Caitlin for me I was working in

124
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,930
privacy in in private practice and in

125
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,060
academia but it was an opportunity to

126
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,180
really focus on on the field of privacy

127
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,970
and gain more expertise and I had the

128
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,280
full opportunity to have before I came

129
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,090
here my path is very different from

130
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,610
Caitlin's geographically I've lived

131
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,800
around the United States but when I was

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,560
finishing law school my dream was to be

133
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,320
an environmental law lawyer like a lot

134
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,659
of law students and the reason for this

135
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,340
was that I was of course passionate

136
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,260
about the environment but also really

137
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,419
interested in science so I figured if I

138
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,220
get to do an area of law that's driven

139
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,639
by science that'll be interesting and it

140
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,090
is and it was over time just through

141
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,820
opportunism really my career took other

142
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,039
paths I got involved working in

143
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,570
intellectual property law which again

144
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,000
involves creativity and innovation and

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,520
sometimes a little science and the

146
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,409
privacy issues that started to percolate

147
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,780
into my career when I was in academia

148
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,449
actually at the University of Maine

149
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,800
which is how I got to know Trevor Hughes

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,990
and actually how I also got to know Oh

151
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,270
Mert na we invited O'Mara to come teach

152
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,820
I started to pay attention to the fact

153
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,159
that the science of today there's a lot

154
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,020
of biology still happening a lot of

155
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,300
innovation in biotech and whatnot but

156
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,900
because in

157
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,699
information technology an area of tech

158
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,570
and science is so pervasive working in

159
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,120
the field of privacy law scratches the

160
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,710
itch of always wanting to know what's

161
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,020
happening in science and tech but it's

162
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,570
different in the sense that issues of

163
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,150
privacy law are not unique to companies

164
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,930
that are necessarily innovating engaging

165
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,780
in trying to acquire intellectual

166
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,090
property rights or companies that are

167
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,139
involved in pollution or otherwise

168
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,520
needing the opportunity to take

169
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,550
advantage of environmental laws

170
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,650
privacy's everywhere every company

171
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,539
retail outfits that are selling coffee

172
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,460
and donuts have to know as much about

173
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,880
privacy in some ways as massive

174
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,250
multinationals so I thought this was so

175
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,910
much fun

176
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,410
here's an area of law that I can

177
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,150
practice regardless of who my clients

178
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,340
are and still constantly have to learn

179
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,530
about science and tech so that's

180
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,070
essentially what's fun about privacy and

181
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,570
I would just say that I got into it

182
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,820
really through relationships much like

183
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,949
Caitlyn said opportunism and

184
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,780
relationships and knowing Trevor and

185
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,849
Omer is how I ended up here yeah so I

186
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,919
guess I'm the poster child for one not

187
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,930
knowing anybody on privacy and to

188
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,090
knowing very little about privacy but

189
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,400
three I guess similarly being very

190
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,130
curious and wanting to do something new

191
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,590
and different and that's actually

192
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,830
probably my career I've been in tech for

193
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,699
thirty years I've done everything from

194
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,729
building apps infrastructure security

195
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,330
it's probably the closest to privacy

196
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,429
bringing bringing all those things

197
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,529
together in a company like the ia pp is

198
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,539
what brought me here the opportunity to

199
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,549
work in in a place that just culture is

200
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,709
amazing the women and the people here

201
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,279
are amazing but the you know the privacy

202
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,500
part actually I'm the newbie I'm the I

203
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,690
came partially to learn because I think

204
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,920
it's so if you're in technology in 2005

205
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,510
2006 2007 in security it was the new

206
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,220
thing it was the thing we were starting

207
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,870
to worry about and we're

208
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,630
security is now 15 years later I kind of

209
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,670
think privacy is where we were back then

210
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,279
and if we look forward that's where so

211
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,930
where privacy is going to be from a

212
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,839
technology perspective so for me I felt

213
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,200
like what a great opportunity to get

214
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,640
involved in in a time where it's

215
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,770
starting to shift more to tech some of

216
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,630
the the laws that are changing or

217
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,010
impacting all the different companies

218
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,990
the technology disruption that's

219
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,820
happening is actually causing some of

220
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,160
the privacy issues as we all know with

221
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,180
AI and and and in machine learning and

222
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,180
things like that so for me to come here

223
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,089
was a lot less about who I knew and just

224
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,880
I guess I feel very lucky that you know

225
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,529
it was three miles away and had really

226
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,510
no idea about privacy and now coming

227
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,690
here and recognizing I still don't know

228
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,600
a lot about privacy but what a

229
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,089
phenomenal opportunity for tech people

230
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,460
to get involved now I mean every company

231
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,560
to read this point every company is

232
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,880
going to have to be thinking about it

233
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,290
whether they're small and they're retail

234
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,460
or whether they're large and their

235
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,100
financial services so to be a part of

236
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,020
helping to find that and promote it and

237
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,930
improve it and and really just be a

238
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,850
voice to the tech community about why

239
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,950
it's so important is is pretty exciting

240
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,390
for me encourage you all to interject

241
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,000
ask questions you know keeping it casual

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,209
I want to note so before you all started

243
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,010
at the ia PP technically your roles

244
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,709
didn't exist in a formal sense so Rita

245
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,209
I'm gonna I'm gonna put you on the hot

246
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,220
seat because you've got the most titles

247
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,640
I have the most titles that didn't exist

248
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,870
I have three titles about how you sort

249
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,550
of shaped that shaped your role here at

250
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,350
the ia pp any challenges you've incurred

251
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,610
along the way look I assume some of the

252
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,930
reasons people might be tuning in today

253
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,520
is less to do with who we are and more

254
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,650
to do with how you can lessons learned

255
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,860
how do these things affect other people

256
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,779
who are maybe thinking about a career

257
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,640
path so I'd rather talk about it from

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,990
that perspective one of the

259
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,860
opportunities that is fun about working

260
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,540
at the IPP is that it is a small

261
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,370
business when I started here we were

262
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,190
fewer than 200 employees but it's also a

263
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,850
global

264
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,279
company so we have members all over the

265
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,350
world so that combination of small

266
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,500
business with a big footprint that's

267
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,870
growing like crazy both in terms of our

268
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,910
membership our customer base and also in

269
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,529
terms of the employees we need to staff

270
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,380
it that is a sweet spot for opportunity

271
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,389
to learn right and to take on new

272
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,399
responsibilities because companies that

273
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,829
are small and growing are always needing

274
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,959
new more and more assistance in support

275
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,949
things I didn't need before they

276
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,319
suddenly realize that they need and in

277
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,029
the case of a small business like the

278
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,100
IPP those needs may not amount to a

279
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,339
full-time job it's a piece of a job and

280
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,769
so if you want to learn fast start in a

281
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,470
small growing company and just be ready

282
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,060
and willing and able say I'll take that

283
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,920
I'll do that right and through that

284
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,470
willingness and I think open-mindedness

285
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,930
order like I and confidence let's be

286
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,060
honest sure I can handle that right

287
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,199
maybe hubris you you acquire new skills

288
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,709
and new opportunity and the titles are a

289
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,449
way of reflecting the fact that your

290
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,870
role is changed in the case of the DPO

291
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,930
role and we definitely wanted to signal

292
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,089
to our members that we take gdpr

293
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,370
seriously as a company not just as

294
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,649
something that we're teaching others but

295
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,420
that obviously we need to be in

296
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,569
compliance as well so DPO signals to our

297
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,790
members oh there's someone that I can

298
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,189
talk to if I have a question about how

299
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,579
of the IPP is using my data so that made

300
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,040
sense we needed you know a step up in

301
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,550
our privacy compliance role and the GC

302
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,660
thing trust me it's just because our CFO

303
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,970
is tired of signing contracts so we

304
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,769
wanted somebody else to do it so at the

305
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,569
moment it really is a contract

306
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,300
management role and the signatory

307
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,889
responsibilities I suspect it will grow

308
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,259
like many other things within a small

309
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:11,170
business but so purely from an advice

310
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,959
perspective I think people who in any

311
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,639
level of their profession who are ready

312
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,160
to make a lane change it's always a

313
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,199
great opportunity and I think Kathy I'd

314
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,490
love to hear from you that you know

315
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,019
coming from a larger institution to a

316
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,649
smaller one while you know the problems

317
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,149
are maybe smaller and the impact may be

318
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,160
smaller the opportunity to learn is

319
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,650
massive because suddenly you're playing

320
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,270
many different roles and you're seeing

321
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,300
so many pieces of the enterprise because

322
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,810
it's such a small that's completely

323
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,060
accurate I've been in large

324
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,310
organizations my whole career until now

325
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,130
and I would say I played different parts

326
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,650
along the way throughout as I mentioned

327
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,870
I have a vast you know vast background

328
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,580
in doing different things but they were

329
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,560
to your point like siloed like I worked

330
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,360
in security for a little while I worked

331
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,770
in building applications for a little

332
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,020
while I worked and actually process

333
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,180
improvement and technology procurement

334
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,790
and actually I would say her GC is

335
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,010
really read as GC role is very important

336
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,270
to me so I think it is kind of fun for

337
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,950
me and one of the reasons I chose to

338
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,200
come here at this point in my career was

339
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,050
to sort of show up as my whole like

340
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,630
everything my whole toolkit I can use in

341
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,760
my role as CTO and and having some not

342
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,950
to knock big corporations because I have

343
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,900
learned so much and there's so much

344
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,240
depth and breadth and opportunity I

345
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
moved around a lot in in the

346
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,380
organizations to continue to learn and

347
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,660
grow but to be able to show up and not

348
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,610
know today if I'm going to be wearing a

349
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,710
technology hat or maybe an HR hat

350
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,880
because there's something we need to

351
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,610
talk to them about or maybe you know

352
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,530
learning about a business organization a

353
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,710
business problem that needs to be solved

354
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,200
I just feel like there's there's so much

355
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,130
opportunity to do it all in one role and

356
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,900
defining you know defining the CTO role

357
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,760
has been really fun for me too it is

358
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,650
actually a part of my background is

359
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,020
taking on a new organization and

360
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,060
standing something up for new need like

361
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,040
I mentioned with security that was

362
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,140
something I spent a good deal of time in

363
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,960
in in 2005 6 7 I wish I could remember

364
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,550
the date but I can't remember it's too

365
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,480
far to just create that organization

366
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,830
that does that so creating new

367
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,530
organizations creating new roles

368
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,660
defining them has kind of been a part of

369
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,410
my my background in what I do but to be

370
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,810
able to do it here at a small company

371
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,880
there's a little more freedom so three

372
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,280
or four weeks in I started talking to

373
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,920
Trevor about the need for maybe a little

374
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,980
more concerted effort not concerted

375
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,180
effort but we're gonna say

376
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,160
in disciplines around some of the data

377
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,660
space that we were playing in

378
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,640
operationally for ourselves so now I

379
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,680
have a data team as well as a technology

380
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,960
team and and that's kind of exciting to

381
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,290
be able to just say oh we need that and

382
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,050
then be able to make it happen without

383
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,070
some of the larger corporation big big

384
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,529
red tape us kind of stuff again not to

385
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:11,020
knock big companies back but you can

386
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,820
move a little more quickly there's a

387
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,680
little I guess maybe a little more

388
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,209
pressure on you to because you are the

389
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,709
decision-maker and that can be a little

390
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,440
frightening as well but but so far it's

391
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,959
been it's been a ton of fun and created

392
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,300
I think creating this organization has

393
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,060
been one of the highlights of my career

394
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,589
I'd say what would you tell someone who

395
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,480
maybe feels a little bit reticent about

396
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,399
taking on a role that didn't exist

397
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,959
before them knowing that they have to

398
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,880
shape it and there's no rules or

399
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,970
guidelines or any of that what would you

400
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,250
tell someone oh I'd love to tackle that

401
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,160
um I guess my my advice would be to to

402
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,040
jump in and ask a lot of questions and

403
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,650
engage with the community in terms of

404
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,190
engaging with folks who are leaders in

405
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,329
that space and who can share their

406
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:06,520
thoughts and advice with you I feel like

407
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,290
the opportunity to learn from others who

408
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,730
are doing something that you have less

409
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,119
experience in is always so valuable and

410
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,939
if I can also just kind of piggyback on

411
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,900
what we were just discussing it for me

412
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,140
when I when I came in to the ia pp one

413
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,349
piece of what I was asked to do was to

414
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,329
lead our privacy engineering initiative

415
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,640
and to some extent this is an area where

416
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,600
Kathy almost hasn't learned from you and

417
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
so many others and I remember when I was

418
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,790
speaking with O'Mara and Trevor and

419
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,860
folks here about this role I said hey I

420
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,420
don't have the the technical skills I

421
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,110
don't have the the background in privacy

422
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,919
engineering myself and their advice and

423
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,110
kind of the way I've approached this was

424
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,830
exactly

425
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,290
to kind of learn from the community and

426
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,990
so I've had this incredible opportunity

427
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,810
and to me this is why I'm enjoying this

428
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,600
this new position enroll so much because

429
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,540
it's an opportunity to learn so reaching

430
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,790
out to academic leaders or industry

431
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,040
leaders our members around the world and

432
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,100
folks like you to try to understand the

433
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,870
pieces of the job that I have less

434
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,640
experienced in it to me that kind of

435
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,160
makes the role a constant learning

436
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,110
experience which I guess from my

437
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,820
perspective is what makes a role fun

438
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,100
yeah I think too in a lot of exactly

439
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,510
what you're saying what I've watched you

440
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,460
do the last six months it's less about

441
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,190
what you know and how you think about

442
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,020
learning and I think that's just that's

443
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,110
just probably any lesson in life is I've

444
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,910
been super impressed with how you've

445
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,860
tackled I I actually wouldn't know that

446
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,560
you didn't know what you just said I

447
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,480
sound like a lot of nose but I I didn't

448
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,740
know that you didn't know some of this

449
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,660
stuff because I do think it is I

450
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,060
actually am grateful to sort of have you

451
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,830
in that role because your research and

452
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,710
your that you have a broad community in

453
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,510
tremendously helpful to bring that

454
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,730
forward so so I do think it's a little

455
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,309
bit more of how you think and and how

456
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,450
you think about learning than

457
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,720
necessarily what you know right

458
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,630
completely agree um I spent 14 years in

459
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,210
academia at a law school and of course

460
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,980
when I was an undergrad I wasn't even

461
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,180
growing up like oh I want to be an

462
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,580
academic like that's the coolest job the

463
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,290
most important job there is is to be a

464
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,180
teacher and I suppose that's sort of

465
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,960
true what I think I appreciate now

466
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,820
though is that while those credentials

467
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,920
while that fundamental education is

468
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,740
crucial it absolutely crucial it changes

469
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,510
the way you think it teaches you very

470
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,780
very deep lasting fundamental base value

471
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,110
skills and it frankly gives you the

472
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,970
credential you might need for certain

473
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,890
jobs let's just be honest getting those

474
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,050
credentials is important that's not the

475
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,700
end of it you can't stop there and you

476
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,080
won't be able to stop there if you stop

477
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,820
there you're done like you're dead so

478
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,650
that's why there is even a market for a

479
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,140
company like the IEP that's why this

480
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,309
particular organization is so reflective

481
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,920
of our time I think because as you

482
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,600
continue through your career you're

483
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
gonna have to credential for something

484
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,350
else you're going to have to be willing

485
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,080
to maybe offer yourself a new level of

486
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,809
expertise or major again in something

487
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,550
that didn't exist before and we're not

488
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,720
this is not the end of it right there

489
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,520
will always be something new and

490
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,980
organizations that are more able to

491
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,330
respond to change which I think

492
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,170
certification bodies and membership

493
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,300
associations can do more easily than a

494
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
degree conferring institution there's a

495
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,480
role in this economy for institutions

496
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,890
like ours for organizations like ours

497
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,960
they provide you with the credential you

498
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,730
need to say yeah I did my homework and I

499
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,670
studied this topic here's my credential

500
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,559
to show for it but they more importantly

501
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,630
probably provide you with the ongoing

502
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,030
continuing education the network because

503
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,670
none of us even after we study for an

504
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,100
exam and take an exam actually know how

505
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,530
to do it and what the problems will be

506
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,390
that comes up in our career so you match

507
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,940
that with a network with people who are

508
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,650
more like you who are in a similar role

509
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,600
to you that won't be all the people you

510
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,010
went to graduate school with right

511
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,570
they've gone off and majored in their

512
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,460
own area

513
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,130
in their own so that ability to

514
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,920
continuously refresh who you need to

515
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,300
know in the moment as you progress

516
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,820
through your career is why there is even

517
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,220
a need for an IEP I think this is

518
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,380
absolutely I think this is a place to

519
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,140
where the law and technology probably

520
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,150
have been a little bit different and you

521
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,530
can correct me if you think I'm wrong

522
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,020
the last 30 years because I think as

523
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,490
you're talking I'm thinking geez if I

524
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,440
just graduated with my math degree and

525
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,330
thought I could you know 30 years for

526
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,250
just step into this role or any

527
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,130
technology role along the way with what

528
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,660
I knew then I mean it's just not

529
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,750
possible even even even my degree didn't

530
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,020
necessarily prepare me for you know my

531
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,690
first role or my second role or anything

532
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,970
technology has just changed so much the

533
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,910
last 30 years that you you haven't been

534
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,400
in technology for 10 20 30 years without

535
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,160
having to learn and now the acceleration

536
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,380
of the tech the change and everything

537
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,620
just makes it that much more critical to

538
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,740
be a little earner in that field and I

539
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,840
just think privacy like I said it at the

540
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,520
beginning privacy is just kind of now

541
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,370
the new thing that in addition to having

542
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,200
all this knowledge about different kinds

543
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,990
of technology how they work together

544
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,150
technology kind of comes in from the

545
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,740
side it's not about what you know it's

546
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,290
about how you do it similar to security

547
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,700
it's not necessarily about what you knew

548
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,160
but how you apply that security to

549
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,920
technology so that to me it you have to

550
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,480
be a continuous learner just to be in

551
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,090
tech Kalyn how much do you credit the

552
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,980
person that first hired you the woman

553
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,500
who first hired you for really shaping

554
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,880
everything else because she knew better

555
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,200
than you did at the time how would you

556
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,150
know that privacy would not yeah you

557
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,490
were willing to say well I respect your

558
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,920
opinion why not I'll jump in yeah no

559
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,580
it's it's a great question I give her a

560
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,220
ton of credit and you know she she

561
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,620
really saw it coming as some other folks

562
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,250
that we know and work with and did but

563
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,550
you know my my first year working on

564
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,770
privacy for the US government admittedly

565
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,420
was really slow and I remember

566
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,730
questioning that what what am i doing

567
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,380
you know she says gonna be big do I

568
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,740
trust that do I stick with it

569
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,990
and one year in all of a sudden Obama

570
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,210
launched the privacy blueprint and from

571
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,940
there everything just took off so yeah

572
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,730
there's these people along the way and I

573
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,160
would say just you know to give a shout

574
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,250
out to her in particular they're they're

575
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,950
women women leaders doesn't have to be

576
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,820
women out there who sometimes play a

577
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,220
more behind-the-scenes role in kind of

578
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,850
are there supporting others recognizing

579
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,530
others and I think a lot of people

580
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,280
credit her for for kind of launching

581
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,110
their careers in privacy and so ya know

582
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,770
I give her a ton of credit I think the

583
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,940
lesson here is really to just be a

584
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,130
consummate learner and be adept to

585
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,170
change I mean really is what I'm seeing

586
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,490
this the common thread and you know

587
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,800
Kathy I'd be curious have you had more

588
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,510
than one pivot in your career and for

589
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,950
someone who maybe is a little bit of

590
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,040
vers to change how does that sort of

591
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,000
shape up I'm a stronger leader and yeah

592
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,300
so um so the impact so many different

593
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,250
things that I am not adverse to change I

594
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,290
actually love change I lean in to change

595
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,470
sometimes to my own detriment perhaps I

596
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,240
you know that in the change curve

597
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,200
there's the folks who who really they

598
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,730
hold on tight to what they know and then

599
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,500
there's a folks who lean in you know

600
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,630
full on throttle changes change for

601
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,920
change sake is good I'm somewhere in

602
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,250
between but I do think I embrace change

603
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,530
quite a bit so for me like none of this

604
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,140
really scares me none of this really has

605
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,570
been tough it's been it's been an

606
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,960
adventure I've had probably gosh I want

607
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,240
to say maybe a dozen pivots in my career

608
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,580
and this just feels like one more but

609
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,300
again you know I think that's part of

610
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,760
for me the last 30 years being in

611
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,280
technology you had to continually pivot

612
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,290
and change I actually would say working

613
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,910
in big corporations gives you the

614
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,500
advantage to pivot quickly there's

615
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,679
there's a lot more opportunities to look

616
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,780
at things differently I I frequently was

617
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,610
the one that raised my hand to say oh

618
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,590
you need something new over there or I

619
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,480
was the one who they gave something

620
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,730
broken to to fix which when things are

621
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,700
broken you learn more so so I would say

622
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,780
I think if

623
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,850
I can't even name how many pivots there

624
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,310
were but I think that's kind of been my

625
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,170
experience that you pivot and you pivot

626
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,920
and you pivot and as technology grows as

627
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,720
new opportunities come there's maybe

628
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,550
different reasons that that happens that

629
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,320
even when my kids are young I probably

630
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,300
pivoted for one reason to be closer to

631
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,190
home I left Boston and came and worked

632
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,650
up in New Hampshire as they got older it

633
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,840
was easier for me to come in here or to

634
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,430
take a different role where I traveled a

635
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,500
lot so so some of it has nothing to do

636
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,020
with career and more to do with the your

637
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,940
life circumstances one thing I love

638
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,030
about the ia pp is it's about your whole

639
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,540
person not just showing up with a full

640
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,250
toolkit of what I have to offer the ia

641
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,470
PP but being able to go home at the end

642
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,450
of the day and and have that work-life

643
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,390
balance - with my family so so I don't

644
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,160
know that's a very meandering answer yes

645
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,410
lots of pivots that's one of our

646
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,410
cultural values here at the IAA pp and I

647
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,460
feel like women definitely have a

648
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,900
different perspective when it comes to

649
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,520
work/life balance and I'd like to sort

650
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,110
of hear more about your perspectives on

651
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,270
that if it's really impacted maybe the

652
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,280
roles you decided to take along the way

653
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,800
in your career paths and and give some

654
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:01,920
advice in perspective no I mean it's

655
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,890
it's a great question that so many

656
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,950
people I think both women and men have

657
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,580
to grapple with of course it has

658
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,070
absolutely you know impacted the

659
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,150
decisions I made I I remember sitting

660
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,380
down once for with you know a very

661
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,490
senior government official who was

662
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,230
exploring a position for me and I

663
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,410
remember her telling me well you know

664
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,540
you can't expect to leave before 7

665
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,100
o'clock at night I just had my first

666
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,230
baby and I said thanks so much this

667
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,850
sounds really exciting but it's not for

668
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,030
me right now you know and so we we make

669
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,360
choices I had the incredible opportunity

670
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,610
and I I'm hopeful that more and more

671
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,410
people will have this type of

672
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,740
opportunity which is after I had my

673
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,530
second child

674
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,050
I kind of faced that challenge and so

675
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,950
wanted to move from DC to New Hampshire

676
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,830
to raise my kids and be closer to our

677
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,070
family support network to help with the

678
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,500
work-life balance and so at the time I

679
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,810
went to my boss and I said you know

680
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,700
thank you at the Department of Commerce

681
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,770
thank you this has been awesome

682
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,410
but I need to quit because I'm moving to

683
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,340
New Hampshire to raise my family and I

684
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,230
was offered the incredible opportunity

685
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,120
to tell work full-time for the US

686
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,690
government and this was about six years

687
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,750
ago now and at a time when that really

688
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,600
wasn't done much in the US government so

689
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,730
it was completely novel for the first

690
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,610
year I barely told anyone because I was

691
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,370
so nervous about screwing it up so a lot

692
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,200
of the colleagues I worked with in DC

693
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,700
thought I was sitting in my office at

694
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,860
commerce you know on Pennsylvania Avenue

695
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,840
and just talking to them on the phone

696
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,550
when in fact I was in New Hampshire and

697
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,310
so that was really lucky for me because

698
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,100
it allowed me to not step out of the

699
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,930
workforce not completely change my

700
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,510
career which is what I thought I was

701
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,930
doing and you know stay in an exciting

702
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,330
field and better manage the work-life

703
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,310
balance by being closer to you know

704
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,160
extended family network so I'm hopeful

705
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,900
that as telework you know it's not novel

706
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,850
anymore more and more folks are doing it

707
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,920
in industry and government I'm hoping

708
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,570
that that might help in some respects

709
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,030
with some of those challenges I don't

710
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,470
know Halon isn't just lucky like they

711
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,240
probably wouldn't let just anybody tell

712
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,570
her you were a superstar and so they

713
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,070
would probably do anything they could to

714
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,030
keep you and now we get you so haha but

715
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,880
I guess my past once again I always want

716
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,980
to think about what are there any

717
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,160
lessons that other people can take I

718
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,810
don't know when I work with law students

719
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,860
my advice usually is whatever law career

720
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,540
you choose just make sure you're working

721
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,880
with people you really like so that's

722
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,020
not necessarily a work-life balance

723
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,660
question on the family versus work but

724
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,910
it's like a place to start oh I really

725
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,210
want to do this area of law but you know

726
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,100
what does it take I'm like you know the

727
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,270
best job you get my

728
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,130
actually be doing something else in law

729
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,140
but if you love the people in your

730
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,390
practice group you'll just love you know

731
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,670
workers comp or whatever because they're

732
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,560
so nice and so no it wasn't your

733
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,820
favorite thing that you studied in law

734
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,560
school but at least the people you work

735
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,510
with are kind and considerate and they

736
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,640
support you and they promote you they

737
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,410
give you good work they help you advance

738
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,780
like all of that is so much more

739
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,000
important than the thing you get to

740
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,770
think about all day long in my opinion

741
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,140
and it certainly worked for me to just

742
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,730
work with nice people that was really

743
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,640
the number one thing and then I did make

744
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,100
choices with my career to be able to be

745
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,780
in jobs where mostly the key issue here

746
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,780
was just pure flexibility can you leave

747
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,330
at any time because someone is throwing

748
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,880
up and the daycare is calling you or you

749
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,290
know because there's a cross-country

750
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,180
meet at 3:30 in the afternoon there very

751
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,980
inconvenient these school functions if

752
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,110
but you know but the right office the

753
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,090
right work environment appreciates that

754
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,380
not only are you going to leave but

755
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,820
you're also probably gonna get your work

756
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,290
done later or when it's you know you're

757
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,230
gonna get it done they trust you some of

758
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,600
that you have to earn but you can shop

759
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,570
for environments where that's part of

760
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,340
the norm and you look and you observe

761
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,050
and you ask in your interview and you

762
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,300
ask you know and clever ways to try to

763
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,190
figure out what is the culture there and

764
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,440
will it support the fact that I love my

765
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,300
work and I'm gonna get it done but I

766
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,490
also really love this life that I have

767
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,080
and the people that are in it outside of

768
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,530
the office

769
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,140
I just wouldn't want to ever work any

770
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,410
place that didn't allow me that freedom

771
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:41,640
yeah I love I love it just so much has

772
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,770
changed you know my kids are older and

773
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,680
so much has changed and I remember I

774
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,120
don't mean to be like the old person on

775
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,380
the couch but I remember when your

776
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,870
choice was you could leave and raise

777
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,170
your kids or you could you know work

778
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,550
7:00 in the morning to 7:00 at night and

779
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,190
some of the choices now we have big you

780
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,080
know back on technology its kind of

781
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,460
technology really it's the video

782
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,380
conferencing it's the laptops and

783
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,240
they've been around for a while but I I

784
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,790
think it's the change in the way we work

785
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,650
and everything has been enabled by

786
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,990
technology and I wish I really do wish

787
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,630
that we had had some of those options at

788
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,000
the time you know my choice I was happy

789
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,860
with my choice to stay in the career and

790
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,900
put my kids in daycare but it was hard

791
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,190
you know when I was in Boston

792
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,960
traveling to New Hampshire you'd get up

793
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,610
in the dark and you leave in the dark or

794
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,410
and you get up in the dark and you get

795
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,670
home in the dark you'd see your house on

796
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,410
the weekends really in the light and

797
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,170
that so I love the options that are

798
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,850
available to people today and i 100%

799
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,520
agree rita you got it's it's not just

800
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,280
the content of the work or the subject

801
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,690
of the work and this kind of gets back

802
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,310
to your other question about if you're

803
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,680
building a new organization how do you

804
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,860
not be afraid of that well it's your job

805
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,640
you know figure out it could be it needs

806
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,130
to be the holistic picture it needs to

807
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,740
be the people you work with the subject

808
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,660
you're working with the ability to make

809
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,220
sure you can go to the track meet or the

810
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,140
soccer game or anything like that and

811
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,880
and that's gonna be what makes you happy

812
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,620
at the end of the day it's personal to

813
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,540
us too and the to take that to another

814
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,730
level how do you as a leader so now

815
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,490
you're responsible for other employees

816
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,040
they want to have a work/life balance

817
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,200
you're going to have to support that but

818
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,850
you also need to set limitations and

819
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,580
expectations so Kathy you've probably

820
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,770
overseen more people than any of us what

821
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,450
where are the challenges that you faced

822
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,780
in so trying to set the limits on taking

823
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,940
advantage but also of course keeping

824
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,860
your good people happy because that's

825
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,660
part of being a good leader I mean you

826
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,010
want your best employees to stick around

827
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,440
so you want them to feel as though this

828
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,880
is you know the right environment for

829
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,100
them yeah absolutely I think there's

830
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,070
there's no secret to it I think part of

831
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,110
it is treating people like adults I mean

832
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,200
I've always been frustrated with the

833
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,300
absolute of rules you absolutely have to

834
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,160
be here at 8:00 and you have to leave at

835
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,900
4:00 or you absolutely have to show up

836
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,280
this meeting on time are you absolutely

837
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,770
like if you treat people like adults I

838
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,720
don't need to approve your vacation time

839
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,850
you know what your workload is you know

840
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,090
you know you know how to how to get your

841
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,290
work done and make sure you have

842
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,790
coverage when you're out and things like

843
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,320
that and actually as a leader it's a lot

844
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,150
easier for you to lead people and when

845
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,590
you treat them like adults then when you

846
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,139
treat them like you need to have all

847
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,540
those rules and everything I think role

848
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,070
modeling is important too and this is

849
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,870
actually one I struggle with I'm an

850
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,690
early bird um I am up between 4:30 and

851
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,610
5:00 and I will come into the office

852
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,320
because I don't have little kids at home

853
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,989
anymore that I need to worry about

854
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,969
and I think sometimes people think uh

855
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,829
you know you know she's working long

856
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,418
hours she expects me to work long hours

857
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:43,520
so I have to consistently say I am NOT

858
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,280
the poster child for for work-life

859
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,199
balance if you have little kids I'm not

860
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,599
so you have to be I think open and

861
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,940
honest and I think the other thing is

862
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,609
you have to be like EQ in a leadership

863
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:57,829
role is so important understanding that

864
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,230
you don't have ten people that all have

865
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,970
the same things you don't know what

866
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,559
someone's going through when they're not

867
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,599
physically in the office or when they're

868
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,609
in the office but they have a sick

869
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,460
parent or or sick spouse or something

870
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,650
going on that they can't control

871
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,420
financially and it's in the back of

872
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,069
their head and you have to be willing to

873
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,309
listen to understand and to make those

874
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:20,900
accommodations and when other people

875
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,579
come to you and say hey that's not fair

876
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,140
it's hot it can put you in a bind

877
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,900
because you're not privacy right tell

878
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,099
people what someone else is going

879
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,540
through but you have to get them to

880
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,790
understand that as a leader you have

881
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,960
listened to this person and you

882
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,000
understand that their circumstances that

883
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,069
need a little accommodation and things

884
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,500
like that so it's not it's not a secret

885
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,170
answer it's not it's it depends but I

886
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,660
mean I'm sure you've seen these things

887
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,990
before as well and exactly Caitlin's

888
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,150
example of I need to go to New Hampshire

889
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,770
I need to raise my kids differently this

890
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,660
is well we're gonna accommodate you

891
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,210
that's a that's a leader that listen cuz

892
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,250
she's well that's because she's totally

893
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,930
but I mean that's otherwise Caitlin's

894
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,490
like sorry I have other options but if

895
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,589
you but I'm sure part of why she's worth

896
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:07,010
it is cuz you worth it by the way she

897
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,490
was treated that way she but it's

898
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,380
because she was treated like she was

899
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,270
valued and she was motivated to work

900
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,329
hard and and if and if you were working

901
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:18,829
if you were working long hours and you

902
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:21,859
weren't being treated well but you we've

903
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:23,690
been like yeah thanks for working from

904
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,950
home I'll find something in New

905
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,930
Hampshire so it's it's it's both sides

906
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,059
but I think you know you got a listen

907
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,140
you gotta learn and you got to recognize

908
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,910
everybody's different they create so

909
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,579
much loyalty if you do that I think you

910
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:37,760
know show trust in people and provide

911
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,230
those accommodations when they're needed

912
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,410
then folks are that much happier with

913
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,000
their jobs and they give that much more

914
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,290
back so absolutely

915
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,880
very interesting well Kathy I'm gonna

916
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,619
put it on you as a self-proclaimed

917
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:54,020
privacy new beer you share with our

918
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,059
virtual viewers any challenges that

919
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:57,500
you've come across being new to your

920
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,890
role and how you don't tell the ones

921
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:12,109
that are privileged and confident yeah

922
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:14,299
it's well it's been an interesting

923
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,339
challenge anyway to come in to a

924
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:18,859
leadership role in an organization at

925
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:20,869
the level and really not be a privacy

926
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:24,740
expert to feel that well on the one hand

927
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,450
I do have the confidence to believe I

928
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,190
belong here and I'm helping I do also

929
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,290
worry at times that people think oh she

930
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,730
doesn't know anything about privacy you

931
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,809
know what's up with that

932
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,390
so I I do think that's it's probably

933
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,030
been myself inside my challenges have

934
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,390
been built inside and and I think you

935
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,160
know interestingly enough it's probably

936
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,859
been less about the shift to privacy

937
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,770
although it's just you get back to that

938
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,599
ground where you're new and learning

939
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,890
again so you have to build up your

940
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,750
expertise and your confidence and know

941
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,089
how to apply it to your technology or

942
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:58,819
your role and more about my shift and

943
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,170
maybe this isn't where you want me to go

944
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,119
manda but my shift has been more going

945
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,920
from corporate to a small company and

946
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,069
and figuring out how to make decisions

947
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:09,530
and stand behind them and and do that

948
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,280
while I'm learning the business and I

949
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,510
think that that's probably been the

950
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,819
hardest for me is making sure that every

951
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,109
day I show up and I've some buddy

952
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:20,390
doesn't feel like what why why is she

953
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,710
making that decision what was she

954
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,690
thinking and hat doesn't she understand

955
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,510
that CCPA won't let that happen or you

956
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,069
know or something like that you know I

957
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,460
just

958
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,859
and I insinuate myself in places that I

959
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:33,829
don't know necessarily that people want

960
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:36,410
me but I think you know Here I am

961
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,619
Caitlyn engineering we're gonna talk

962
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,190
about vendor management so but yeah I

963
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,930
really appreciate your insertions

964
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,359
because I feel like one you have the

965
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,829
confidence to insert yourself in

966
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,720
situations where maybe you aren't the

967
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,059
subject matter expert I kind of want to

968
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:57,740
touch on the whole imposter syndrome

969
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,589
things that you know a lot of women do

970
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,970
face men as well

971
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,290
but I'd be curious to know you're all

972
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,240
very high up in your field respected

973
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,329
leaders how you combat that like I don't

974
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:10,190
know what I'm doing but I need to look

975
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,099
like I do so how do you how do you

976
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,349
navigate those waters cuz I'm sure

977
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:17,720
actually took an acting class in college

978
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,809
and that helps a little bit and no I

979
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:22,430
really did take an acting class I was

980
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,390
really bad but you're the Quickie I was

981
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,200
serious about this where are my in

982
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,760
situations where I admit that I don't

983
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,020
know what I'm talking about

984
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,920
probably everyday at least a little bit

985
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,720
you know it's about the dynamic of who

986
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,730
I'm around and if I feel like I know

987
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,230
more than the other people in the room

988
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,059
because I've done it for longer so again

989
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:46,490
I work a lot with students with junior

990
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,980
people just entering the profession just

991
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,230
on a day-to-day basis or with people who

992
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,140
aren't whose jobs at the company are not

993
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,030
privacy they look to me to know what

994
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,930
that is and we work together

995
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,760
collaboratively to solve the problem so

996
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,230
again we're a team of like one and then

997
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,250
everybody else in their domain so I

998
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,690
would say the situations where I most

999
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,359
feel like I am out of my league are the

1000
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,579
technical ones and my solution is just

1001
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,990
to confess my ignorance and ask people

1002
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,030
to gently teach me what I don't know

1003
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,790
because I'm more dangerous if I pretend

1004
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,640
that I do right and I try to make

1005
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,089
because in making privacy the answer the

1006
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:30,799
legal if you will or compliance answer

1007
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:32,869
often depends on how the technology

1008
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:33,260
works

1009
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,440
they're completely interrelated if the

1010
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,420
technology works this way well then we

1011
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,920
either have to change that or we have to

1012
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,569
inform people or we need consent or

1013
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:43,490
whatever the situation is so that's

1014
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,650
where it struggles all the time I'm

1015
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,869
learning new things about oh I didn't

1016
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:49,640
know it did that and what is that by the

1017
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,380
way what is that word that you just used

1018
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,089
mean sometimes I'll run and look it up

1019
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:55,730
quietly after the meeting but yeah I

1020
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,670
think I think instead of pretending and

1021
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,059
having a show of us it's the opposite

1022
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,819
which is to say please explain that to

1023
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,069
me so that I can do my job better and

1024
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:09,589
therefore the company can you know be

1025
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:12,470
more secure you put the company first in

1026
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,180
that instance rather than try to pretend

1027
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,779
that's

1028
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:18,650
how I per said I want to build on two

1029
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,900
things that you just said there in terms

1030
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,299
of the the lack of technology I feel

1031
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:25,539
like that would be one of my

1032
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:28,099
recommendations kind of going out to the

1033
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:30,199
privacy field that if I could do it

1034
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,569
again I would get some technical

1035
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:34,999
expertise and I just feel like looking

1036
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:37,609
forward hey you know I perhaps

1037
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,039
self-interested ly see privacy

1038
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,140
engineering but the fusing of tech and

1039
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,779
privacy as where the profession is

1040
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:47,539
headed and I think that those in the

1041
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,219
legal field or the policy field would

1042
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:51,499
really benefit from from getting some

1043
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:55,880
education in the tech space but but but

1044
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,999
on the imposter syndrome I have to say I

1045
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,489
feel like I've tried to take you know

1046
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,400
asking questions is always good but I

1047
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,809
feel like that impostor syndrome thing

1048
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:09,469
is super real and that I at least feel

1049
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,419
it all the time even maybe when I

1050
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:13,179
shouldn't and I don't know if that is

1051
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:16,039
something that women experience more or

1052
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:18,199
not but I've had to continually remind

1053
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:21,259
myself hey you know just as much as

1054
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:24,439
anyone in the room on axe that you're

1055
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:28,849
talking about so don't be hesitant don't

1056
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:31,429
feel like an imposter and just remind

1057
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:34,369
myself of that so that I don't think why

1058
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:35,869
do you want me to talk about that how am

1059
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:41,539
I to discuss it and so I think it's like

1060
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:45,439
a check it's a check it's a it's

1061
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,659
something inside you that says hmm it

1062
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:49,599
makes you stop and think do it

1063
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,400
am I the expert in the room or am I not

1064
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,229
the expert in the room and and at

1065
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:57,679
different times it can undermine you and

1066
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,229
you don't participate and you when you

1067
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:02,119
should and at other times it maybe

1068
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,799
should tell you not to participate I

1069
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,689
don't know maybe that's the wrong way to

1070
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:07,549
look at it but I've been in meetings

1071
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:09,289
where I think I know more than the other

1072
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:10,880
person but the other person is simply

1073
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,059
insisting that they know the most and

1074
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,619
and there's nothing you can do to

1075
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:17,059
convince them otherwise or at least

1076
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,579
that's their posture and I think that's

1077
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:21,859
what I actually sorry I'm interested yes

1078
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:23,869
I think that's why I actually think

1079
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,579
impostor syndrome and I have it in

1080
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:28,159
spades like everyone it's it's actually

1081
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:28,490
a

1082
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,890
humility thing it's a it's a it helps

1083
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:36,260
you sort of think through your role in a

1084
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,450
conversation and it can get absolutely

1085
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,850
can get in your way but I I would say in

1086
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,210
the spirit of you know professional

1087
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,110
development or coaching or whatever

1088
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,750
we're doing here on this couch today we

1089
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,330
all have it like we all have it and

1090
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,760
you've got to find your toolkit to work

1091
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,619
through it and you've got to figure out

1092
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:56,780
and you are gonna have those people we

1093
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,460
all have those people that are just so

1094
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,710
officious that even if they you know

1095
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,990
they could walk in the building and tell

1096
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,260
me something about technology with no

1097
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,240
and just the way they say it will stop

1098
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,500
me in my tracks and I'll think wow

1099
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,330
they're really smart and they know what

1100
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,000
they're talking about and maybe maybe

1101
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,650
they know something I don't and but you

1102
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,450
have like you have to know yourself and

1103
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,490
you have to recognize and I think that's

1104
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,310
professional development it's it cuts

1105
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,020
through I think it does cut through

1106
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,000
gender because I have a lot of male

1107
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,350
colleagues who have told me in the past

1108
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,450
that they have an impostor syndrome but

1109
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,900
I think it ties directly to humility and

1110
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,660
the knee I think humility is so powerful

1111
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,000
I do think saying I don't know something

1112
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,150
actually it builds credibility it builds

1113
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,460
people think oh wow she's in that role

1114
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,170
and she's willing to say she doesn't

1115
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,940
know something it's way more powerful

1116
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,280
than trying to BS your way through an

1117
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,070
answer and have it yeah I don't know I

1118
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,380
just I think it's a little bit of both

1119
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,210
too I think when you hear that voice in

1120
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,920
your head saying you don't know what

1121
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,150
you're doing you don't know anything in

1122
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,920
the room it's saying hey thanks I've got

1123
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,570
this like I know what I love that

1124
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,210
feeling that confidence sometimes I feel

1125
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,350
like that voice is there to keep you

1126
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,000
safe and keep you in your comfort zone

1127
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,540
and it's like I'm good thank you but on

1128
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,310
that it is actually time ladies for

1129

their careers privacy or not new in

1138

their careers and go

1139
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,400
oh so in terms of new in their careers

1140
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,710
I'm gonna pass on a piece of advice that

1141
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,350
I feel like led me to where I am today

1142
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,430
and it was super random I moved to

1143
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,850
Washington DC without a job slept on a

1144
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,910
cousin's couch and I was on the Metro in

1145
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,690
Washington DC perhaps going you know for

1146
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,190
an informational interview or something

1147
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:10,820
and this random woman on the metro how

1148
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,830
we were talking I have no recollection

1149
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,940
but she said oh yeah you should just

1150
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,580
walk into the Congress and hand them

1151
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,770
your resume and you know tell whatever

1152
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,300
committee it was that I was interested

1153
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,400
in at the time that you want to work for

1154
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,560
them and I was like wait I can do that I

1155
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,390
can just reach out directly to the

1156
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,680
people I want to work with like I don't

1157
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,390
have to go through some job board she

1158
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,560
was like oh yeah people do it all the

1159
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,180
time and I ended up with the job on the

1160
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,990
hill by just doing that and so I was I

1161
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,850
was blown away by it but my piece of

1162
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,670
advice there is if there are people that

1163
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,470
you want to work with whether it's an

1164
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,450
industry and government or whatever do

1165
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,310
your research figure out who's working

1166
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,530
in this space you want to work in and

1167
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,900
reach out to them often the emails maybe

1168
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,340
not public but you could figure it out

1169
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,310
so just reach out and I think we're also

1170
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,230
always you know happy to help in the

1171
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,330
privacy field and talk to folks but

1172
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,250
reaching out is what I would recommend

1173
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,490
yeah absolutely I have different things

1174
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,310
I would say don't have your heart set on

1175
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,350
one thing and then only pursue that

1176
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,210
because every single opportunity that

1177
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,920
you have and you take and you learn it's

1178
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,330
a learning one that could take you to

1179
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,130
the next thing the greeter was

1180
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,930
describing where you thought you were

1181
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,250
going to be and where you ended up are

1182
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,030
very different I would say I know

1183
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,790
yourself gets what what motivates you

1184
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,280
what inspires you what what you want to

1185
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,110
show you want a place like Rita was

1186
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,340
saying early I'm going to point to read

1187
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,780
again actually these are words from Rita

1188
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:40,940
it threw me apparently what I'm you know

1189
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,470
what kind of work-life balance do you

1190
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,880
want to have who do you want to work

1191
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,190
with the network is so important and and

1192
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,050
I Haunted percent agree with what you're

1193
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,860
saying pick up pick a phone email call

1194
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,300
reach out to a network reach out to

1195
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,299
someone who may

1196
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:57,029
Network used tools like LinkedIn to try

1197
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:58,739
and find people who maybe find people

1198
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:02,039
who know people but then I would say but

1199
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,779
it's on you like don't pick up the phone

1200
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:05,219
and call somebody and say hey could you

1201
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,529
get me a job it's more could you get me

1202
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:09,209
an interview could you get me you know

1203
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:13,079
could you find a place that maybe I

1204
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:15,239
could learn more about this like explore

1205
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,069
explore explore and then once you have

1206
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:18,900
your first job there's a whole other set

1207
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,150
of things I would say like do those

1208
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,609
things that that maybe put you out of

1209
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:27,410
your comfort zone that maybe definitely

1210
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,059
do anything you know try anything try

1211
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:33,390
different things and and and and be open

1212
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,699
and and be a continuous learner because

1213
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,349
I would say you know graduating with

1214
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,529
math degree if you told me even fifteen

1215
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:42,089
years into my career that I'd be in some

1216
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,410
sort of tech career I probably would

1217
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,039
have told you you were crazy but yeah

1218
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:48,179
common thread between what you both said

1219
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:49,859
that as I was just thinking about that

1220
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:51,239
is that there's a you're actually able

1221
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,549
to have a personal relationship with

1222
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:57,449
whoever it is you want to work with so

1223
00:48:57,449 --> 00:48:59,819
by going into Congress personally

1224
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:03,059
humanly physically being there they can

1225
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:05,189
see who you are talk to you meet you and

1226
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:07,349
instantly know this is a competent

1227
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:10,109
bright attractive person and I want to

1228
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:12,989
spend more time with her right we live

1229
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,400
in such a virtual world everyone's

1230
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,439
always texting in social media and

1231
00:49:16,439 --> 00:49:17,579
there's like very little human

1232
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,529
connection but you'll find that your job

1233
00:49:19,529 --> 00:49:21,479
comes when you have a human connection

1234
00:49:21,479 --> 00:49:24,029
and you Skype with someone to say hey

1235
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,529
I'd like to know more about the job can

1236
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,779
I set up a Skype physically see each

1237
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:31,170
other show your face be human it makes a

1238
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,299
massive difference on your perception of

1239
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:34,979
someone when you can turn them from a

1240
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:36,569
piece of paper a CV that they've worked

1241
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,519
over for hours and hours and hours to an

1242
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,349
actual person that you can talk to and

1243
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,239
relate to and look in the eyes so if you

1244
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,739
have to volunteer to get in the door

1245
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:46,920
anything you can do to be physically in

1246
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,569
their space and show who you are as a

1247
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,729
human I think is a game-changer to

1248
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:52,679
getting that first job yeah I would say

1249
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:53,939
to once you're in there

1250
00:49:53,939 --> 00:49:56,279
yeah advice doesn't change so when

1251
00:49:56,279 --> 00:49:58,019
you're in a meeting sit at the table

1252
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,369
that's like I read that in a book

1253
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:01,650
somewhere early on sit at a table speak

1254
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,069
up if you got interrupted just sort of

1255
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:06,929
stand your ground and make sure that

1256
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:08,100
your voice

1257
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,570
to matter because I think that

1258
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,220
especially for women I think that

1259
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,110
happens to us a lot where we sort of

1260
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,750
fade into the background or we we let

1261
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,480
others lead in the in in instead of

1262
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,980
sticking our neck out or anything like

1263
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,710
that but just show up and maybe maybe

1264
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,040
this newer generation I'm aging myself

1265
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,320
here but maybe maybe it's different I

1266
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,660
mean I a lot of my my son's friends

1267
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,130
women they're very strong and they're

1268
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,750
they really have that sense that they

1269
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:34,500
belong

1270
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,330
but in my career I feel like a lot of

1271
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,990
times it was you know you just sit in

1272
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,220
the back of room and you don't speak

1273
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,450
your mind and then you leave and you

1274
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,220
think nobody even remembered that you

1275
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,890
were there so be present and show up and

1276
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,540
everything you're saying make the

1277
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,310
personal connections find those

1278
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,740
advocates that want to help you look for

1279
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,720
mentors don't think you know everything

1280
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,280
right out of the gate I I know there's

1281
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,930
been nobody that showed up my door it

1282
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,700
showed up at my door and asked me for

1283
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,530
help that I've said yes ari I don't have

1284
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,660
time for you I mean if people really

1285
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,400
want to help especially women want to

1286
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,280
help women continue to grow and thrive

1287
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,040
and if you show interest in in other

1288
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,320
people's work whether it's in trying to

1289
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,060
get a job if you're interested in that

1290
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,350
work and you show interest in what

1291
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,240
they're doing whether it's looking for a

1292
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,180
mentor or looking for a job I feel like

1293
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,740
people love that and you know then

1294
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:30,000
you've made a comment or who I you know

1295
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,160
who I still continue to reach out to and

1296
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,600
ask for help and guidance who's been

1297
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,120
instrumental with my career in the last

1298
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,340
year as I've made changes and shifts and

1299
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,070
things like that so even again back to

1300
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,630
that role modeling I role model that I

1301
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,640
need help at this stage in the game and

1302
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,230
we all do and that's pretty normal

1303
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,530
so which actually leads to my neck next

1304
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,680
question mentor or sponsor do you need

1305
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,100
one

1306
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,720
both does it make a difference you need

1307
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,570
both I mean a mentor is there by your

1308
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,790
side helping coach you a sponsor is

1309
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,430
someone who is there advocating for you

1310
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,230
when you're not in the room so that's

1311
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,520
the person that's going to talk about

1312
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,500
you to get you know in a promotion

1313
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,360
discussion or a compensation discussion

1314
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,670
or this who do we want to put on this

1315
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,590
project discussion you need both and

1316
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,970
frequently your mentor can be your

1317
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,280
sponsor but not always I mean you you

1318
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,509
really want to make sure that you

1319
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:26,609
have both I just say to sure but I think

1320
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:29,639
I surely do believe that a good leader

1321
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:31,380
is someone who can look at all the

1322
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,909
people that work for them and have them

1323
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:34,919
actually be in positions as good or

1324
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:36,839
better than the one that they had that

1325
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:41,369
they are there to help their team grow

1326
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:43,889
and thrive in advance rather than

1327
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:46,739
constantly being jealous that they have

1328
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:48,179
to be the boss or they have to have the

1329
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:50,849
swankiest title or whatever because if

1330
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:52,589
you're in an environment where that

1331
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,380
leadership always wants to be a senior

1332
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,869
and more important and isn't willing to

1333
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:00,899
kind of help you become as good as or

1334
00:53:00,899 --> 00:53:03,119
even better like reach another level

1335
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,699
within another organization you're gonna

1336
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:08,099
wither you know so that's a hard one but

1337
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:09,389
if you find yourself in a leadership

1338
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:12,029
position how can you set your ego to the

1339
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:13,709
place where you actually want to judge

1340
00:53:13,709 --> 00:53:15,689
your success by how well everyone who

1341
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:17,279
worked for you ended up doing in this

1342
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:19,169
world that's what your boss your first

1343
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:22,289
Boston and that's a rare thing and it's

1344
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:23,759
something we should all actually work on

1345
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:25,979
even if it feels too feminine well

1346
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:28,079
embrace that that's exactly what women

1347
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,329
should be doing as leaders is to you

1348
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:31,139
know that's why there should be more

1349
00:53:31,139 --> 00:53:33,359
women leaders so if your instinct is to

1350
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,099
promote others then that would

1351
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,929
ultimately make everybody you know

1352
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:39,899
happier in more success need to give

1353
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:41,459
people the opportunity to be in the room

1354
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:44,219
with your boss yeah you need to coach

1355
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:47,219
them to have the confidence perhaps to

1356
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:50,159
present what they have created versus

1357
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,499
you constantly having constantly but

1358
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:54,599
taking that from them to present to your

1359
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,189
boss and that actually helps you

1360
00:53:56,189 --> 00:53:57,989
continue to grow and I would say the

1361
00:53:57,989 --> 00:53:59,939
flip side of that is if you're in a role

1362
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:01,589
where your leader isn't doing that for

1363
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:03,959
you if you feel like geez every time I

1364
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:05,159
have a good idea I come up with

1365
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,079
something it's my boss who always

1366
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,089
presents it or who always takes the

1367
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:10,559
credit for it you maybe need to think

1368
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,969
about moving to a different role or a

1369
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:13,199
different leader or having that

1370
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:14,819
conversation sometimes it's just they

1371
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,189
may not even be aware and that's you

1372
00:54:17,189 --> 00:54:19,409
know a brave thing to to go in and say

1373
00:54:19,409 --> 00:54:21,689
hey I would love the opportunity to

1374
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:23,880
present my ideas instead of always

1375
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,149
having them done through you but

1376
00:54:26,149 --> 00:54:29,159
fantastic advice we have time for one

1377
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:32,009
last question ladies tell us a female

1378
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:36,349
leader in privacy who you admire and why

1379
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:41,970
well you know I feel like I could spend

1380
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,890
an entire hour on that question I think

1381
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,609
that's why the privacy profession or one

1382
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:49,740
of the reasons it has been so rewarding

1383
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,829
there are so many impressive female

1384
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:56,760
leaders so maybe I don't think I could

1385
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,440
pick one I've talked about one already

1386
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,720
Kristin Jensi who I think plays that

1387
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,200
role of of supporting a lot of leaders

1388
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,510
in the field and she's built a lot there

1389
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:14,519
are two different women leaders in

1390
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,460
privacy in Europe who I have a lot of

1391
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,380
admiration for I'm a little nervous

1392
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,910
about calling out names you know in a

1393
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:25,670
private secret that's all positive so

1394
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:32,849
one of them is a colleague who taught me

1395
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:34,460
that

1396
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,380
if you bring chocolate to a meeting your

1397
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,299
meeting will always go better and I

1398
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:43,859
admire her for her diplomacy and also

1399
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:47,339
just for her her creativity and her

1400
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:50,670
determination and that's Isabela Rican

1401
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:54,089
who now runs our kind of set up the

1402
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:57,240
European Data Protection Board and she's

1403
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,380
just always been an incredibly

1404
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,529
hard-working creative and diplomatic

1405
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:04,230
person and the other person who I have a

1406
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,319
lot of admiration for is very well known

1407
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:11,029
in the privacy profession and that is

1408
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:14,640
Helen Dixon who leads the Irish DPA and

1409
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,190
I think one thing I've been super

1410
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,250
impressed in watching her take over that

1411
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,740
position it's kind of remaking that

1412
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,440
office she grew it an incredible amount

1413
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,789
and making it into an office that is

1414
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:33,420
just incredibly well respected for the

1415
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,180
work that they do and also just an

1416
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,220
office that really stands up for for

1417
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,250
what they believe in and has has engaged

1418
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,640
in cases that that are very challenging

1419
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,420
and they're always willing to

1420
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,299
to take them on and I think that that

1421
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:58,349
takes incredible leadership all right

1422
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:00,630
well thank you ladies that wraps up our

1423
