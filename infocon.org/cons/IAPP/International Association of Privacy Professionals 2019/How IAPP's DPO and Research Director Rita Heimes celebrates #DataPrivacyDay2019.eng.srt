1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,849
howdy everybody I am Sam Fievel I'm the

2
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,219
content director here at the ia pp and

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:15,230
we are getting ready to celebrate data

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,109
privacy day and data privacy day is

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,840
surely a big day for raising awareness

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,810
around you know how do consumers can do

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,280
better with their privacy how they can

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,600
manage their settings all that sort of

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,150
stuff but clearly here at the ia pp we

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,058
want to celebrate privacy pros and who

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,550
better to celebrate than the privacy Pro

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,789
at the privacy Pro Association which is

13
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,010
not only none other than Rita Highness

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,739
here DPO at the IPP how you doing I'm

15
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,539
doing well Sam thanks for having well so

16
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,219
it's big pressure is what I think all

17
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,960
the time right like you know you're the

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,100
DPO at some you know company that uses

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,229
data all the time people expect there to

20
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,479
DPO they expect it to you know go this

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,699
way in that way the IDP like you kind of

22
00:00:58,699 --> 00:00:59,629
have to get it right all the time

23
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,549
otherwise everybody's like even though

24
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:03,079
OPP doesn't know how to do privacy it's

25
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,690
a disaster so how do you manage that

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,119
kind of level of stress mm-hmm I see

27
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,310
well we we keep it very open mind we

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,890
appreciate feedback from our customers I

29
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,470
will admit that having people who

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,270
actually read everything you write is

31
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,250
makes the job a little more tense little

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,300
stressful because like it's like you

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,550
know 45,000 bosses right all of our

34
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,920
members are like I know how to do

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,870
privacy and you're terrible at it that's

36
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,490
right but if we get it right feel you

37
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,660
know we feel extra good about ourselves

38
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,120
that's true so so we strive to get it

39
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,480
right and I will also say that it helps

40
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,940
having alert members write in and tell

41
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,140
us when they think things aren't

42
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,730
transparent enough or they want more

43
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,310
information because we realize that not

44
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,160
everything we do is clear to them and we

45
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,170
could do a better job so the constant

46
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,659
feedback loop with very friendly and

47
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,030
accommodating customers is actually

48
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,480
really helpful so it's stressful but

49
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,980
actually a really rewarding way to do

50
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,560
privacy yeah well I feel like we're kind

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,930
of we can kind of make the mistakes so

52
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,310
they don't make them in some ways right

53
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,200
so what I love about the DPO

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,449
confessional is we kind of lay out our

55
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,639
thought process and we're not afraid to

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,709
say first we tried this that would

57
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,030
didn't work then we tried this that

58
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,769
didn't work we came down to this and

59
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,959
that's what you see and that lates all

60
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:18,720
of our member

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,770
they don't have to show their dirty

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,570
laundry because we just did they can

63
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,460
learn from our mistakes and they can you

64
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,510
know make better decisions for

65
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,550
themselves it's amazing how many

66
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,080
comments we get along those lines like I

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,340
was just thinking about this thank you

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,360
so much

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,980
yeah that must feel pretty good well I

70
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,720
would say that if I weren't so busy

71
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,250
trying to do it right I would write more

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,100
you know but so it is good there's

73
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,770
plenty to confess privacy is hard to

74
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,950
nail and the laws itself are complicated

75
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,230
sometimes really confusing like the

76
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,910
California Consumer Protection Act

77
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,910
so knowing whether or not you've guessed

78
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,680
what the regulator is thinking and have

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,810
reflected that in your practices is

80
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,320
virtually impossible so it's I think

81
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,800
hopefully a good thing that we can

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,920
express the complexity honestly with our

83
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,630
members and share sort of be on the same

84
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,670
side as them because we also understand

85
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,650
how hard the work is but if there are

86
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,540
nuggets of useful information then

87
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,450
that's a good thing I think that is a

88
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,390
good thing and I also think we you know

89
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,570
your job is most reflective of the most

90
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,090
of our members right so I think you know

91
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,070
the privacy teams that sort of get the

92
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,620
most press are Facebook Google Microsoft

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,110
they have big giant teams of privacy

94
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,040
professionals you know I remember

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,230
looking at our database Microsoft has

96
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,270
like 500 members with us or some huge

97
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,190
number but that's not most of our

98
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,900
customers most of our customers have

99
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,760
like one person or a half a person or

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,480
something like that

101
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,489
you're not even our full-time dpo not

102
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,050
even close you're like a general counsel

103
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,550
and a director of research and you have

104
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,269
like 17 jobs I think that's most of our

105
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,540
members that must help you kind of think

106
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,340
of new research projects and you know

107
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,170
better ways to help them yes in fact

108
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,209
that's how it was pitched to me but you

109
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,620
should become our privacy officer it

110
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,700
will make you better at all your other

111
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,090
jobs that's right here's where it is

112
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,680
easier for us than it might be for

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,410
others because our mission is privacy

114
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,420
and promoting the privacy profession

115
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,700
everyone at the IPP knows and cares

116
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,738
about it so when you talk to the

117
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,149
marketing team or the sales team or

118
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,850
anyone else about how we collect

119
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,320
personal information and what we do with

120
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,550
it and the fact that we need to be more

121
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,860
transparent or maybe even modify our

122
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,090
practices

123
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,130
they're open-minded they're accepting

124
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,110
right they might grumble but it's always

125
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,360
with a smile and then everybody pitches

126
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,790
right in so it would be harder to do it

127
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,590
an organization that was maybe less

128
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,280
appreciative of the role of privacy you

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
don't know you're not swimming as

130
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,600
upstream at mission to interpret the

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,610
laws strictly as possible and provide

132
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,470
everyone with the highest level of

133
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,310
privacy that we think the law requires

134
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,230
rather than try to do the opposite which

135
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,790
is to get away with as much as we can

136
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,440
right and probably not very many other

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,270
organizations have like I don't know 100

138
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,050
CIP P's or whatever we have on staff so

139
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,000
you know I think it's a super

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,520
interesting thing in that the the

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
scrutiny is both you know sort of a

142
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,930
positive and a negative and you know I

143
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,520
feel that obviously writing about

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
privacy I'm trying to sort of write

145
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,070
about laws for you know 40,000 or

146
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,990
whatever lawyers that we have who are

147
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,970
also doing their own interpretation but

148
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,830
it also makes me sort of take the job

149
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,370
more seriously I feel that pressure you

150
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,440
know so in some ways it's got to be a

151
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,200
sort of positive thing in that you know

152
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,270
it's not hard to sort of get motivation

153
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,410
for the day you know you've got you sort

154
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,210
of know that if you mess it up people

155
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,950
will actually notice whereas you know a

156
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,539
lot of jobs you can kind of have fast it

157
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:54,240
no one really cares I will say the one

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,060
the one thing that makes me gives me a

159
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,030
little stress is that if if someone

160
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,970
thinks that we have to crossed a line

161
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,310
they tell us that it's so ironic did

162
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,780
whatever usually it's an email they

163
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,690
weren't expecting and so we of course

164
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,580
provide them with all the opportunity to

165
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,280
not get them anymore but the fact that

166
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,300
