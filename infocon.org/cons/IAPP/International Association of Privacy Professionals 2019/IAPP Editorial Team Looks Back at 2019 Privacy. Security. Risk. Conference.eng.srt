whirlwind of a week here in Vegas we had

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,550
some big breaking news yesterday

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,510
Alastair McTaggart who was one of the co

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,480
architects of the CCPA

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,460
announced a new ballot initiative and

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,499
released the text for it just this

22
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:06,170
afternoon it's called the California

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,600
privacy rights and enforcement act of

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,860
2020 or supriya I guess oh my isn't

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,780
really roll off the tongue like cacti

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,700
used to do our old acronym for the CCP

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,840
CCPA but that's big news and it was

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,420
great to have him here on stage during

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,220
our keynote session

30
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,520

oversight board and Stacey shrew sir

34
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,350
Chester Chester very hard to say yeah of

35
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,940
the California Attorney General's Office

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,250
had a really good conversation this

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,100
afternoon or this morning about this new

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,030
initiative as well as the forthcoming AG

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,590
rulemaking that's gonna be coming out in

40
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,680
October so lots going on of course

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,800
beyond that we had lots of practical

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,600
topics here from data subject access

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,720
requests add tech what's going on with

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,598
location data we had an update from

45
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,639
Latin America all kinds of really great

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,020
stuff going on here Angelique

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm gonna toss this up to you what what

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,260
what stuck out to you I know you're

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,030
going to be reporting on this new

50
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,550
initiative what stuck out to you these

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,590
last couple days yeah I mean I think the

52
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,900
big thing certainly and it was it was

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,400
kind of a cool opportunity for us here

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,250
at the IPP was having Alastair here the

55
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,690
day after he dropped this bombshell

56
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,640
which has everyone buzzing of course

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,140
just while we're all in the midst of

58
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,270
trying to figure out what the final

59
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,280
version of the CCPA looks like and what

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,140
we need to do as companies to start to

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,520
get compliant with that now all of a

62
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,470
sudden were contending with the prospect

63
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,130
of something that could be even more

64
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,800
difficult to comply with and stringent

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,200
so I haven't actually looked at the text

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,990
of I've been calling up CCPA version 2.0

67
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,520
but I knew that at some point it would

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,290
be the true name would be revealed so

69
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,760
it'll be interesting to dive deep but it

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,310
was cool having them those force or rock

71
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,710
stars on the stage and you could almost

72
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,790
sense a little bit of tension I think

73
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,430
between Stacy sets every single time

74
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,090
Stacy

75
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,650
Chesser very difficult and Alastair

76
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,510
because she actually said it's cut she

77
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,920
feels like she's at the AG's office

78
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,570
they're sort of playing 3d chess with

79
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,760
Alastair every time they make a move he

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,190
makes a counter move and but she did say

81
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,320
that the AG's office is going to stay

82
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,120
laser focus on the task at hand which is

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,050
to promulgate the regulations under the

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,010
CCPA and and to help to enforce it

85
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,510
I thought Travis LeBlanc made a really

86
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,630
good point that you know we put out a

87
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,860
survey recently with one trust that

88
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,480
found that two percent of companies are

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,670
basically ready for a CCP a Travis

90
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,020
actually said talking to people at the

91
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,160
conference I think is probably even less

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,220
than that and he said despite that if

93
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,560
you're a company with a big trove of

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,140
data if you're a household brand but

95
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,130
really whoever you are but especially

96
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,480
for those companies you really need to

97
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,850
be doing your best to at least try and

98
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,800
comply because even though the AG's

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,330
office isn't going to start enforcement

100
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,610
actions until July of 2020 they can

101
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,320
actually enforce retroactively Lee back

102
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,959
to January 1st 2020 when the law comes

103
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,470
into force

104
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,900
so there's City and municipalities have

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,079
some with some power yeah so it was sort

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,910
of a it was a really fascinating dynamic

107
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,560
talk and I thought some really great

108
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,600
perspectives and nice to have sort of to

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,790
hear it from the horse's mouth Alastair

110
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,710
did say that there was a mandatory 35

111
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,460
day comment

112
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,590
on the new version the new citizens

113
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,419
initiative and he does want to hear from

114
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,280
people he did mention that you know he

115
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,500
is pro-business and we hear that from

116
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,090
him frequently and he's trying to walk

117
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,919
that middle line of reasonableness

118
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,740
between protecting consumers who are you

119
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,479
know more than ever calling for their

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,759
privacy rights and allowing business to

121
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,039
flourish he did know you know that he

122
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,539
could have I think as sort of defending

123
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,680
himself he could have put a private

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,240
right of action into the first version

125
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,410
of the CCPA and he didn't because he

126
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,360
didn't think that was fair so it'll be

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
interesting to see how people weigh in

128
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,750
and I think we're gonna be grappling

129
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,789
with what this new version of the CCP

130
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,949
looks like for many months to come yeah

131
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,750
you can definitely expect us to be

132
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,240
working in that in the coming weeks like

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,949
I said the text just came out it's 51

134
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,130
pages if you follow at daily dashboard

135
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,410
on Twitter you can find it there and

136
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,389
we'll definitely be having more content

137
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,280
on that tomorrow yeah in the coming week

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,289
so definitely stay tuned for that

139
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,310
beyond CCPA it's not all just CCPA here

140
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,930
Ryan what did you what did you see this

141
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,270
week well you say it's beyond CCP it's

142
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,830
what I'm talking about is still gonna

143
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,990
tie a lot of into CCPA which is data

144
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,360
subject access requests are just they're

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,639
popping up in every almost every session

146
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,169
even if they're not necessarily about

147
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,449
data subject access access requests

148
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,160
there's still a lot of questions that

149
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,960
people have about the best way to handle

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,570
them went to one of the sessions on D

151
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,210
SARS yesterday it was a packed room

152
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,979
everybody's asking a ton of questions

153
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,620
questions about whether they should have

154
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,110
an intermediary to handle data subject

155
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,699
ass access requests whether they should

156
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,150
build their own solution or find one of

157
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,840
the many tech vendors that take on that

158
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,510
that capability how much of that process

159
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,560
should be automated and the

160
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,620
considerations around that and verifying

161
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,650
the people making the cross based on the

162
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,990
the research that came out of DEFCON a

163
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,270
couple months ago and some of the

164
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,979
vendors on our exhibit floor are

165
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,820
starting to try to solve that problem

166
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,560
because it's one that will continue to

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,940
go on it's real quickly mention what

168
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,389
what that DEFCON research was so a

169
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,080
researcher from Oxford University posed

170
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,210
as his girlfriend to try and get as much

171
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,879
information about her as possible and

172
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,099
it opened up a lot of eyes some

173
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,840
loopholes that could be found with the

174
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,900
data subject access request he's able to

175
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,689
get some of that information yeah so

176
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,150
yeah there's there's still a lot to go

177
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,860
about it I mean it popped up in a

178
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,810
session about reporting to the board it

179
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,699
popped up in the latin-american session

180
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,389
as key use cases so that's just it's

181
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,189
especially with the California consumer

182
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,539
privacy act when you know already you're

183
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,389
tuned to gdpr there's still a lot that

184
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,340
people have to figure out about these

185
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,979
about these requests and I think it's

186
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,719
one of the things that with the

187
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:14,969
California AG's guy's guidance coming

188
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,789
out that will help inform what happens

189
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:19,500
when January first comes around

190
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,969
excellent excellent

191
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,129
Joe what did you see this week oh you

192
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,710
know this was again the first go-around

193
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,840
for me in terms was your first big event

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,729
the first big event the first big

195
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,770
conference you know the thing that

196
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,110
really stuck out to me was the last

197
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,520
session that I went to today which was a

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,909
US DPR and whether you know there was

199
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,620
going to be a federal project could be a

200
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,830
federal privacy law sir it's basically

201
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,389
they're comparing it to the GD P R and

202
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:51,930
the UV protection so in general the the

203
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,819
message that I got out of it was a lot

204
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,649
of people seem to think that you know

205
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,300
we're seeing a lot with CCPA and

206
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,830
obviously what Alastair came out with

207
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,479
yesterday and we're all talking about

208
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,580
today you know it seems like it's really

209
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,039
starting to push things towards a

210
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,229
federal law but you know talking with

211
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,839
the panel that was there we had Obama

212
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,000
administration officials that were there

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,649
kind of mom you know going through

214
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,719
things and they really don't think that

215
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,969
you know it really has pushed it that

216
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,620
much yet they think that it's more of a

217
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,060
listening face still and we're probably

218
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,500
about 10 years out oh wow that's what I

219
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,610
said that's a part of this estimation

220
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,560
I've heard everything everybody was

221
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,899
sitting there and we all raised her

222
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,698
hands in about five years yeah you know

223
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,620
that was the general consensus and they

224
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,208
kind of sat up there and looked at us

225
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,860
and they were like yeah I think you're

226
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,870
you guys might be a little off Wow

227
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,659
so that but I mean beyond that though

228
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,130
what they kind of talked about in that

229
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,990
session too wasn't kind of an underlying

230
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,390
theme that that I heard was again

231
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,560
baseline privacy programs and really I

232
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,000
I wrote about this in the first workshop

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,600
that I attended on Monday was it much it

234
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,960
was Monday Jesus we've been here all but

235
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,700
ya know in that workshop it talked about

236
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,680
you know really trying to get a privacy

237
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,140
program going on baseline principles

238
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,360
that can kind of you know again extend

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,600
out and be able to you know instead of

240
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,120
having to really overhaul with different

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,279
legislation that comes out you're able

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,650
to really instead just kind of tweak

243
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,810
things as it goes and you know that's

244
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,640
what really they talked about in that

245
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,990
final session today when they're talking

246
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,120
about a federal law which is you know it

247
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,130
might be foggy in a sense but overall

248
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,250
the the you can kind of prepare yourself

249
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,290
by just kind of getting that baseline

250
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,060
program set lay the groundwork yes carry

251
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,490
on that uh no I mean it's interesting to

252
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,770
hear ten years I in I'm based in DC and

253
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,510
as you guys as you guys know and I and I

254
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,580
frequently hear three years but I even I

255
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,780
I do think that that seems like

256
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,880
optimistic because we have we just have

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,980
such a tough time in Congress with any

258
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,820
conversation in general so I I would

259
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,020
also be sort of surprised if we push

260
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,310
something through within three years at

261
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,780
the same time I'd love to see some

262
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,630
action on that I'd love to stop writing

263
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,000
about the if and when and just start

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,760
writing about here it is but yeah we'll

265
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,640
see to to countervailing forces at play

266
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,890
here it seems on the one hand the

267
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,839
political reality is a DC right now

268
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,700
right we're starting in a pinch bit

269
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,740
process and we're going into a

270
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,360
presidential election next year right

271
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,490
there's a lot of uncertainty there yeah

272
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,459
I'm saying but at the same time with

273
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:37,370
Alistair's new ballot initiative this

274
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,500
might put pressure on industry to really

275
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,920
ramp up maybe some more lobbying or more

276
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,390
efforts in DC - maybe you know Trump

277
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,940
this may actually use that word

278
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,699
this this California legislation and try

279
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,529
and get something out of Washington so

280
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,029
it'll be interesting to see how those

281
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,279
kind of countervailing forces play out

282
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,800
yeah there's but I agree I think it's

283
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,329
hard to imagine a federal law in the

284
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,079
next year or two yeah so to be to be

285
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,399
determined better right

286
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,050
yeah what else so what else stuck out to

287
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,970
all of you Angelique yeah we had a

288
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,980
really great session today I always get

289
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,959
super nervous when it's me moderating a

290
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,190
panel I don't know why but I'll just

291
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,449
we'll never get over that I don't think

292
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,029
but we had a great panel today Ryan

293
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:21,440
actually came and reported on it so

294
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,790
we'll have a story on that this week

295
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,560
which would be great but I've been

296
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,699
hearing from a lot of privacy

297
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:26,899
professionals that they've been

298
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,310
struggling a little bit to find jobs

299
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,019
from really qualified talented people

300
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:31,970
that I interact with in DC I have the

301
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,009
pleasure of interacting with in DC so we

302
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:35,569
wanted to have a discussion about what

303
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,149
are companies looking for are those

304
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:39,620
expectations realistic should you apply

305
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,420
for that job even though you don't check

306
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,519
every single box should you kind of go

307
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,750
for something that seems a little bit

308
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,389
out of your reach strategies for having

309
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,740
solid interviews so we had a

310
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,540
representative from the public policy

311
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,600
team at Facebook we had a job recruiter

312
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,889
who works in the privacy in recruiting

313
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,930
space who told us that privacy is his

314
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,399
hottest industry to recruit for right

315
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,829
now of all the industries and then we

316
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:03,290
also had Callie Schroeder who is a good

317
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,699
friend of ours a former West and fellow

318
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,829
at the IPP who recently went through the

319
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,509
job search the very frustrating process

320
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,060
of job search and could provide that

321
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,529
perspective so we had a really nice

322
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,540
conversation about from kind of those

323
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,269
three diverse perspectives about how to

324
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,189
approach getting your next and you know

325
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:21,350
hopefully best gig and had some really

326
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,000
great audience participation some real

327
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,459
practical questions and some takeaways

328
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,170
about you know making sure your LinkedIn

329
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,839
profile is updated and being prepared

330
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,620
for that question specifically the

331
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,350
Facebook representative was saying the

332
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,730
question that he often asks people is

333
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,230
what's one thing we've done wrong and

334
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,579
that you should go in and I think that

335
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:41,689
probably applies to any job you're

336
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,459
applying for anywhere you should go in

337
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,050
knowing the company knowing what you

338
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,730
know public steps they've taken or maybe

339
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,790
missteps and having an answer for that

340
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,550
so I thought it was a really like robust

341
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,779
conversation that we had a good session

342
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,699
and hopefully people came away with some

343
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,290
ideas about how to approach you know

344
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,579
their next gig in the privacy and

345
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,759
three great yeah certainly a universal

346
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,259
thing like just even in any industry

347
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,410
yeah I felt I felt myself going back to

348
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,749
coming out of college me like oh man how

349
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,610
do you get all this experience and how

350
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,319
do you get your foot in the door right I

351
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,149
think with such a it's such a you know

352
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,319
new industry that these uh these issues

353
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,970
are coming up but I think they're gonna

354
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,309
be salt quicker because of the need that

355
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,959
people need for these people right

356
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:24,799
you're gonna have to start letting

357
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,939
people in the door and training them up

358
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,679
eventually because there's such great

359
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,119
need for the marketplace one of the

360
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,860
things I noticed this week I don't know

361
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,689
if you all experienced this as you talk

362
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,389
to people here attending here was seemed

363
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,299
to be a lot of new faces a lot of

364
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,160
first-time conference attendees yeah a

365
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,869
lot of folks kind of finding their way

366
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:44,170
into privacy I talked to a few different

367
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,029
attendees who have kind of come into

368
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,649
privacy through security which I thought

369
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:49,279
was interesting

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,309
mm-hmm so I don't know if any of you

371
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,920
found that this week as well just a lot

372
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,420
of crossover I felt like to you know

373
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,299
Utah again if you're sitting here and

374
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,369
you're saying oh you know you think of

375
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,350
an IEP conference and it kind of comes

376
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,579
back to the privacy angle but you're

377
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,549
seeing a diverse amount of people from

378
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,839
different branches that are trying to

379
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,029
bridge the gap in some departments which

380
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,379
I thought was kind of interesting and

381
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:16,100
again the just the age limit as well I

382
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,989
mean there wasn't you know you're seeing

383
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,089
people of all ages trying to to get this

384
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,470
it's not an older crowd it's not a

385
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,329
younger crowd everyone is trying to get

386
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,459
behind this yeah and that's one of the

387
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:26,899
things that Callie Schroeder on the

388
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,509
panel today was saying was that it kind

389
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,829
of works to her advantage sometimes when

390
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,379
she's applying for jobs because everyone

391
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,850
pretty much has the same amount of

392
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,769
experience with CCPA readiness right

393
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,389
because like it's only been alive for a

394
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,100
couple of years and sort of the same

395
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,389
thing with the GD P R so if you're

396
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,889
coming into the market as a newbie like

397
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,110
a lot of people are grappling with

398
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,769
grappling with all of these new

399
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,540
regulations and so you can kind of be

400
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,100
competitive even if you are a

401
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,029
fresh-faced

402
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,499
you know excellent yeah while I happen

403
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,829
to lead a panel on Tuesday talking to

404
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:59,839
some journalists which was pretty

405
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,549
interesting we had a Kashmir Hill who

406
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,069
also spoke or a keynote stage today and

407
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,389
it was really interesting to hear her

408
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,519
talk about her experience quitting the

409
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,630
big five

410
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,080
Bernie's Google Microsoft Facebook Apple

411
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,900
and Amazon and she said Amazon was the

412
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,140
hardest by far for her hmm to quit and

413
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,100
we also on this panel earlier had Alex

414
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,740
Kingsbury the editor of the privacy

415
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,670
project

416
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,670
the New York Times opinion page that's

417
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,410
really exploring different privacy

418
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,560
issues throughout the world and Joseph

419
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,960
Cox who is a reporter for motherboard

420
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,990
and vice talking about how they're

421
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,970
reporting on privacy these are really

422
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,430
complex issues that you know all of you

423
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,710
our members are dealing with that we're

424
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,910
trying to cover and that they're trying

425
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,460
to cover in helping the average consumer

426
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,410
understand the complexity of you know

427
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,770
the ad tech and ecosystem and what

428
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,270
different laws are meaning for their

429
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,580
lives so there's a really interesting

430
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,770
conversation it was funny right before

431
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,070
going up on stage Alex who not only had

432
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,630
it's the privacy project has a broader

433
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,790
role at the New York Times had just

434
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,340
gotten word that Nancy Pelosi was going

435
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,950
to be announcing on PA proceedings for

436
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,660
Trump right as we went up on stage that

437
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,400
was pretty interesting he was able to

438
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,560
still maintain a good conversation with

439
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,240
