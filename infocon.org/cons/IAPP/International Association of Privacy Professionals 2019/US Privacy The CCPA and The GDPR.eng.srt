P R and the CCPA and then we're going to

36
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,540

37
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,460
overlap and what are the differences and

38
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,230
we're going to finish the program by

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,450

evolving areas of law we're going to

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,820

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,540
go ahead and get started and Dominique

113
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,100
is going to get us some going today so

114
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,340
Dominique it's all yours

115
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,260
thanks Dave so you know first we thought

116
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,200
we just talked about data subject rights

117
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,358
in the gdpr because it's sort of the

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,029
basis for how we're going to compare the

119
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,190
rights that are available in California

120
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,640
so of course with jpr you've got a right

121
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,470
to act

122
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,070
that's an article 15 that the residents

123
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,270
have they have the right to correct data

124
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,360
and request that under Article 16 they

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
can stay the subjects in the EU can also

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,000
make the racial request but there are

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,670
some specific limitations as to when the

128
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,790
ratio requests are valid you know you

129
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,280
can only bring them under certain

130
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,860
circumstances and so it's very important

131
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,650
to realize that a ratio requests are not

132
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,570
just automatic and in the EU then

133
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,490
subjects have the right to restrict the

134
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,650
processing of the data they have a right

135
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,870
of portability they have objection

136
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,320
rights they have the ability to object

137
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,230
to automated processing and even though

138
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,840
it's not really stated as a right they

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,810
do have I just put here the transparency

140
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,780
obligation that companies have because

141
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,560
other the GDP are they do need to have

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,140
transparency with respect to their to

143
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,220
consumer notice under article 13 so let

144
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,700
me just move on here to just talk about

145
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,260
the post GDP our landscape so as you

146
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,140
guys you know probably heard right after

147
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,470
GDP our went into effect on May 25th the

148
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,000
data protection authorities are I guess

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,710
supervisory authorities now throughout

150
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,070
the EU were just daily with thousands of

151
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,080
data subject right requests and and what

152
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,030
the thousands of data subject rights

153
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,510
claims that followed data subject rights

154
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,730
requests that were sort of thrown on

155
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,720
companies and so one of the things that

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,400
has come up is that because the Data

157
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,530
Protection Authority has been so busy in

158
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,800
the EU many companies and there wasn't a

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,650
real process that's been outlined in

160
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,560
article 84 getting information to

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,870
companies about the complaints that have

162
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,730
been lodged against them with the

163
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,880
Supervisory authorities it's only months

164
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,190
later that many of the companies start

165
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,180
getting coffee

166
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,370
the complaints to see what had been

167
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,550
actually lodged against them and with

168
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,860
the Supervisory authorities this to you

169
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,310
you know back up a little bit there's

170
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,920
also in addition to the complaints that

171
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,060
are coming in I'm going to talk to you

172
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,650
about some specific claims that are

173
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,630
being asserted but in addition to the

174
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,940
complaints that are coming in there are

175
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,690
also sweeps that regulators have been

176
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,300
sort of initiating to be able to check

177
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,360
GDP our readiness and so we have here on

178
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,860
the slide that it's Dutch Data

179
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,790
Protection Authority looking into you

180
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,830
whether there's been sufficient

181
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,560
compliance with gdpr through a selective

182
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,220
group of companies I think about a

183
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,840
hundred or so have been selected in

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,180
various different industries and they're

185
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,730
focusing more on whether the article 30

186
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,680
reports exist and are up you know are

187
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,530
appropriate with respect to put it to

188
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,350
just swing back to the litigation front

189
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,670
for a second the you know obviously max

190
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,320
schrems non profit group and why OBE you

191
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,150
filed for actions on May 25th that's

192
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,990
none of your business

193
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,910
Gotti you for those of you that don't

194
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,250
know about it though they were against

195
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,970
Google and then it's Instagram whatsapp

196
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,110
and Facebook more broadly those

197
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,110
complaints were actually lodged with the

198
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,420
regulators under Article 80 as

199
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,180
representative actions which you know

200
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,040
nonprofits are allowed to bring

201
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,220
representative actions under the GDP are

202
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,910
article 80 subsequent to that on May

203
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,350
31st there were another group of

204
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,190
representative actions that were filed

205
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,660
against Facebook Google and Apple Amazon

206
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,270
and LinkedIn and those complaints are

207
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,720
publicly available and those were filed

208
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,610
in the French with the Camille in in

209
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,100
France and then there's been a bunch of

210
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,350
additional questions

211
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,940
Francis sort of turned into

212
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,880
a hub of a lot of these complaints but

213
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
just to give some sense and we don't

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,089
have all of them but just in the first

215
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,509
24 days after the GDP are a little over

216
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,019
400 complaints have been filed and

217
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:05,380
that's from some eye apt data actually

218
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,990
then here stateside we have seen a wave

219
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,940
of collective actions have been filed in

220
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,110
the u.s. recently basically in the in

221
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,310
the form of shareholder derivative

222
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,389
actions challenging companies for

223
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,199
misrepresenting or allegedly

224
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,120
misrepresenting the state of their GDP

225
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,670
our readiness what's interesting to me

226
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,759
and the the Nielson complaint that was

227
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,060
filed is that this was not triggered by

228
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,069
any complaints that had actually been

229
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,680
lodged with supervisory authorities or

230
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,509
complaints from EU residents about

231
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,000
Nielsen's GDP our readiness this was

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,940
just you know a shareholder you know

233
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,949
that filed this this lawsuit in the

234
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,870
Southern District of New York you know

235
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,880
an American shareholder that filed the

236
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,100
lawsuit you know taking the position

237
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,180
that the GDP our readiness was not was

238
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,920
not properly stated that's just

239
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,959
something to give a sense that you know

240
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,930
I guess I'm gonna give you like a little

241
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,670
preview here of the difference between

242
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,019
how the Europeans are reacting and and

243
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,660
our our culture in the u.s. of

244
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,740
litigation activity so you know there

245
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,009
are lessons that we've learned obviously

246
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:22,220
for in our class action history in the

247
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,350
US that show patterns that we're

248
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,620
starting to see that are arriving in the

249
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,689
EU with respect to these representative

250
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,970
actions so we're seeing coordinated

251
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,430
activity there's a number of different

252
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,279
organizations that have been involved

253
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,839
lockwood in France and yov EU and many

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,569
other consumer groups are putting on

255
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:48,040
their website sort of you know pre said

256
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,279
consumer or preset data subject request

257
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,060
but data subjects can assert about

258
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,980
complaints about these days they're

259
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,069
focusing on the scope of consent on the

260
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,870
website that's what we've seen but

261
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,480
our turnkey tools that consumers can use

262
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,020
to assert claims against companies in

263
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,690
the EU they the other thing that's

264
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,550
happening which is we've seen that's

265
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,410
reflected it's sort of from the playbook

266
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,740
of what goes on in the US a number of

267
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,300
companies are got these data subject

268
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,130
requests thought they might have only

269
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,960
received one or two and when they

270
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,570
actually dig under the hood or or they

271
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,850
actually get served with the actual

272
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,020
complaint that's been filed with the

273
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,029
supervisory authority it's then that

274
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,529
they learned that literally hundreds of

275
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,870
complaints of data subject rights

276
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,670
requests had been asserted against the

277
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,339
company through the website or through a

278
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:45,830
help desk or through other you know

279
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,600
various means writing to you know

280
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,400
individual employees and the problem

281
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,610
there is without a coordinated strategy

282
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,339
you've got companies that are providing

283
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,920
differently you know varied responses to

284
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,230
different requests and then there are

285
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,480
also another thing that we see a lot in

286
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,220
the u.s. that we're seeing in the EU

287
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,230
with respect to these data subject

288
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,410
requests they're sort of predicate acts

289
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,890
that they are including in these demands

290
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,440
that assume certain facts that may not

291
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,300
be actually correct so to just before I

292
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,600
leave this slide just to give an example

293
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,390
a very common risk that we're seeing is

294
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,890
that companies are receiving data

295
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,230
subject requests that say delete all my

296
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,580
data because the week all my data

297
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,550
because I delete all my data because I'm

298
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,760
withdrawing content and if it if the

299
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,150
deletion or a ratio request is based on

300
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,650
marketing data for example and the

301
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,510
company is actually relying not on

302
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,089
consent as a valid legal basis but

303
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:53,570
rather legitimate interest many times

304
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,010
companies are not making that

305
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,080
differentiation they're just responding

306
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,420
to that data subject saying oh yes we

307
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,740
will delete your data within the next

308
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,250
thirty days only to find later that when

309
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,050
the complaints are filed against the

310
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,730
company and the supervisory authority

311
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,850
those those responses are being used as

312
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,730
predicate acts to to claim that the

313
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,790
company has admit

314
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,150
that they are relying on consent as the

315
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,400
basis for processing the data because

316
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,680
they responded to the the data subject

317
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,080
request without clarifying that they

318
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,700
were relying on another valid legal

319
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,650
basis like legitimate interest for their

320
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,470
marketing okay so what have we seen on

321
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,130
the fine front we haven't seen huge

322
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,930
fines yet out of the EU with the

323
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,910
regulator's you know of course we've

324
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,490
heard about 4% of global turnover or 20

325
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,350
million euro and those larger fines are

326
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,070
anticipated to start rolling in in 2019

327
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,870
but so far the fines have been

328
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,780
relatively lowest as indicated on this

329
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,420
slide I think the largest of fine has

330
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,890
been issued by Portugal for four hundred

331
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:01,410
thousand euro what's important for GPR

332
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,470
in terms of you know the next phase now

333
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,960
that so much of preliminary work was

334
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,700
done to get to get compliant the

335
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,560
important thing now is to to pay

336
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,360
attention to keeping up the compliance

337
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,660
but also paying attention to defenses

338
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,550
when you are responding to data subject

339
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,640
requests so I just put here on a slide

340
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,250
we have a GDP our legal playbook that

341
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,260
we've developed for clients but many

342
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,080
other companies have you know can think

343
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,970
through what works in their environment

344
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,480
but you know there as I said for the

345
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,370
ratio request for example you can only

346
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,650
make them and under the GDP are under

347
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,020
you know a set set of circumstances

348
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,120
which are listed here like the data is

349
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,860
no longer necessary for the purposes its

350
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,790
collected or incentives withdrawn or

351
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,260
they can challenge legitimate interest

352
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,120
or there's you know various other means

353
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,970
and if there is a defense even if you

354
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,890
are going to voluntarily comply with the

355
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,070
request it's important to indicate that

356
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,810
yes well we will delete your data in 30

357
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,250
days but just we want to make it clear

358
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,050
we're not processing it on the basis of

359
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,280
consent or if there's if you know if a

360
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,430
valid erasure request has not been

361
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,460
asserted to make it a point even if you

362
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,170
are going to comply with it voluntarily

363
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,610
to make it a point that a valid request

364
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,700
has not been it has not been made by the

365
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,740
user very important to preserve defenses

366
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,100
for litigation risks

367
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,790
so that takes me to discuss you know the

368
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,509
CCPA

369
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,209
because the California consumer Privacy

370
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,529
Act does also you know provide a number

371
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,720
of data subject grades requests and just

372
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,490
as a brief premier I think most of you

373
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,160
will probably already know this but the

374
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,970
lot actually doesn't effect January 1st

375
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,029
2020 it gives California consumers a lot

376
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,610
of Rights that they did not have before

377
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,829
and germane to this discussion and why

378
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,930
we're talking about it now as it gives

379
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,540
California consumers the right to have a

380
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,990
12-month look back so January 1st in

381
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,380
2020 California consumers can reach out

382
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,360
to companies who collect their personal

383
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,029
information or sell it and ask for

384
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,120
information about those processes going

385
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,649
back twelve months prior

386
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,329
so what companies are doing today

387
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:24,209
literally this month in 2019 to be able

388
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:27,180
to track California data disclosures

389
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,610
will have a direct impact on their

390
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,440
ability to respond to these requests

391
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,680
come January 1st 2020 a year from now

392
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,190
the law applies to give these rights to

393
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,139
consumers and consumers are defined as

394
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,500
just any California resident who's in

395
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,470
California resident is defined in our

396
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,720
tax code and and that that definition is

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,180
tied into and the deffend in the CCPA

398
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,959
it means anybody that's in California on

399
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,240
a non temporary basis so that's just you

400
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,810
know kind of a very broad group it gives

401
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,670
California consumers or California

402
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,150
residents here these you know rights

403
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,609
against businesses and then not every

404
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,650
business is covered it's a business's

405
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,480
company that's doing business in

406
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,980
California and collects personal

407
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,650
information of California residents that

408
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,390
also has one of the three things here

409
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,159
below and they just need to have one of

410
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,829
them either the company has in excess of

411
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,909
twenty five million in revenue or it

412
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:29,520
buys or sells or shares personal

413
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,470
information of fifty thousand or more

414
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,429
California consumers or it derives fifty

415
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,169
percent or more of its revenues from

416
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,430
selling personal information

417
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,670
with respect to the the second prong for

418
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,590
businesses of collecting more than fifty

419
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,830
fifty thousand or more collecting

420
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,330
personal information from fifty thousand

421
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,980
or more California consumers that might

422
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,760
seem like a lot but if you are able to

423
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,230
if you have a website and you're able to

424
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,540
geolocate either through IP address or

425
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,860
otherwise the location of the of the

426
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,730
residents then that's going to be

427
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,870
sufficient so in terms of the new rights

428
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,660
let me just drill down very briefly and

429
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,460
then talk about some things more

430
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,740
specifically there is an abbreviated

431
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,590
right to know about data that has

432
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,780
collected the purposes and the

433
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,490
categories of data that are collected

434
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,830
under seventeen ninety eight point one

435
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,350
hundred a there's an expanded right to

436
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,530
know that California residents will get

437
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,950
to know about how their data is used

438
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,350
from companies that collect personal

439
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,090
information and that's under seventeen

440
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,880
ninety eight point one ten there is also

441
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,530
a right to know about the sale of

442
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,060
personal information and also

443
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,400
disclosures for a business purpose so I

444
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,110
wanted to emphasize that's under

445
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,700
seventeen ninety eight point one one

446
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,700
five I hear a lot about companies

447
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,170
attempting to make a distinction between

448
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,980
sale of data and whether something

449
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,780
should constitute a sale first of all

450
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,370
the definition of sale is very broad it

451
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,230
includes any exchange for valuable

452
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,000
consideration but even beyond that

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,160
seventeen ninety eight point one fifteen

454
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,470
does give California consumers the right

455
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,540
to know about disclosures for a business

456
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,270
purpose so just you know be aware that

457
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,180
there's that component there's a right

458
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,190
to opt out of the sale of personal

459
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,830
information for adults and a right to

460
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,750
opt in in other words you companies are

461
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,520
prohibited from collecting personal

462
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,100
information I mean from selling personal

463
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,430
information from kids without opt-in

464
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,800
content and the kids can provide that at

465
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,100
Ages you know between ages 13 and 16 and

466
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,020
under the age of thirteen parentals need

467
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,450
to provide that Bobtown consent there's

468
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,280
also a right to access and portability

469
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,770
under seventeen ninety eight 100 d

470
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,230
and then there's a right to deletion

471
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,360
which is similar to the erasure right

472
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,220
although there are a few more defenses

473
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,100
to deletion rights in California and

474
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,660
then there's also a right not to be

475
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,120
discriminated against for asserting any

476
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,330
of the rights that are one through seven

477
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,920
so um I'll be you know brief here but

478
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,100
just to go over some of the details of

479
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,320
these rights I just we put these slides

480
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,210
together to provide more specifics so

481
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,830
for the abbreviated right to know for

482
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,750
100 a seventeen ninety eight point one

483
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,430
hundred a a consumer can make a request

484
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,010
of a company a verifiable request to

485
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,710
know the categories of PII collected and

486
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,930
the specific pieces of P I collected

487
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,800
about the consumer and and of the

488
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,170
purposes of those of that collection

489
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,010
the second consumer right which has to

490
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,410
do with the expanded right to know the

491
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,100
consumers can issue a verifiable request

492
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,310
to a company to know the categories of P

493
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,070
I collected the categories of sources

494
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,110
from which the P is collected the

495
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,880
business or commercial purpose and the

496
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,530
categories of third parties within the

497
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,500
business shares in addition the specific

498
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,110
pieces of P I that the company has has

499
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,880
collected about that particular consumer

500
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,420
can be requested you know this the the

501
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,350
expanded right to know also includes a

502
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,370
requirement to include some of this

503
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,710
information in a privacy policy but I

504
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,930
want to focus on the specific request

505
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,730
the verifiable request that consumers

506
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,760
can assert because that requires a level

507
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,910
of granularity that may not that

508
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,040
companies may not be thinking about it

509
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,270
just just generally so then they're

510
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,830
going to go to the consumer right number

511
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,530
three the detailed right to know about

512
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,640
personal information that sold or

513
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,620
disclosed for a business purpose within

514
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,930
45 days the company is to identify the

515
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,340
category or categories of consumers PII

516
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,970
that's actually sold by the business and

517
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,800
also the categories of PII that are

518
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,990
disclosed for a business purpose and

519
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,730
they need to be provide

520
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,040
two separate lists and their specific

521
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,740
requirements about the format of how

522
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,679
that information is disclosed with the

523
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,559
right to opt out once a consumer an

524
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,690
adult asserts the right to opt out of

525
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,350
the sale of their personal information

526
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,600
then that opt-out must be respected and

527
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,940
you cannot attempt to change the

528
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,179
consumers mind or get them to you know

529
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,919
change their decision to opt out for at

530
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,320
least 12 months so there's backend

531
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,360
compliance that companies need to put

532
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
into place with respect to the right to

533
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,010
opt in as I said you can get consent

534
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,900
from children between the ages of 13 to

535
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,690
16 but you need their opt-in consent to

536
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,850
sell their data and for kids under the

537
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,549
age of 13 that you need to have a parent

538
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:51,049
or a guardian give you consent for their

539
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,460
for the sale of the data so this goes

540
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,480
beyond copper with respect to the the 13

541
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,809
to 16 year olds with respect to the

542
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:02,429
consumers right to access and

543
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:04,860
portability this is the sixth right and

544
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,130
this is under Section 17 98 point 100 D

545
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,650
as a consumer asked to access the data

546
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,780
you have to take steps to disclose it

547
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,450
and then you can if you're providing it

548
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,770
electronically it should be in a

549
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,840
portable fashion I want to pause here as

550
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,669
I've been describing all these rights I

551
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:21,990
just want to make it clear there are a

552
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,500
number of defenses to each of them that

553
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,299
are both general and specific but just

554
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,580
as a progressive just I'm giving you the

555
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,290
rights that I'm not giving you every

556
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,350
single defense that would go with them

557
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,080
then the seventh rights the right to

558
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,330
deletion once you receive a valid

559
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,210
deletion request then you should delete

560
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,669
the data on the basis of a verifiable

561
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,280
request and the what constitutes a

562
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,290
verifiable request will be forthcoming

563
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,210
and guidelines that are being

564
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,309
promulgated are being discussed and

565
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,990
created by the California Attorney

566
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,150
General's Office right now there are

567
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,220
public hearings on that topic as well as

568
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,130
various others that the California AG is

569
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,860
involved in developing they've

570
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,780
specifically asked and called for

571
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,150
comments from industry

572
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,490
- we have been covering the hearings the

573
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,340
public hearings on Aria I know I apt has

574
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,490
as well been really surprised at the few

575
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,410
number of comments that are coming

576
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,980
through and public hearings and so many

577
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,630
industry verticals that have not been

578
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,180
really represented in public comments so

579
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,000
just wanted to let you know that on our

580
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
portal at Perkins - we comm backslash ad

581
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,850
tech you can find a link where you can

582
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,890
provide comments specific comments that

583
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,230
relate to your industry that will be

584
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,090
provided to the AG's office in an

585
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,930
anonymized

586
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,180
format to at least get the business

587
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,550
perspective out and then the 8th

588
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,320
consumer right is the right not to be

589
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,000
discriminated against this means that

590
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,820
you cannot provide different you know

591
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,680
levels or quality of goods and services

592
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,230
for consumers exercising their right not

593
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,960
to be not to be you know not to have

594
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,230
their data either sold or or you know

595
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,450
any other right that they might have

596
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,640
asserted to request data under rights

597
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,820
numbers 1 through 7 you can however

598
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,010
provide financial incentives for data

599
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,800
and it has to be linked to the value of

600
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,280
the data so conversations right now to

601
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,870
be had with you know your marketing

602
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,540
teams and others to help figure out the

603
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,850
value of data for things like loyalty or

604
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,850
coupons or other sort of promotions that

605
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,670
you might want to give and they and

606
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,410
before I get to the independent business

607
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,780
obligations I'll just say it's kind of

608
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,740
interesting my old alma mater at Brown

609
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,070
University there's a cafe that literally

610
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,130
allows students to come in and provide

611
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,680
their personal information as the actual

612
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,580
consideration for the coffee or they can

613
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,770
they can decide to pay for a cup of

614
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,600
coffee so you might see more sort of

615
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,210
transparent things like that popping up

616
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,510
at posts ECPA the other thing so I

617
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,530
talked to you about all the business

618
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,150
obligations that go with the consumer

619
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,920
rights but there are three independent

620
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,330
business obligations I want to bring to

621
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,700
your attention number one and these are

622
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,040
not tied to any particular to consumer

623
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,420
right but they're required under the

624
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,740
statutes the companies must train those

625
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,210
employees that will be responsible for

626
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,850
answering questions about personal

627
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,640
information and and handling personal

628
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,559
information about the consumer rights

629
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,870
sets that California consumers do have

630
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,750
they must also create designated methods

631
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,730
for asserting rights under the statute

632
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,850
and there's some specific guidance in

633
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,059
the statute of some suggested ways for

634
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:48,550
giving methods for certain rights are an

635
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,410
800 number and if a company has a

636
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,520
website for a website you know icon or

637
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,130
notice so that company consumers to know

638
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,920
how to assert their right but the

639
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,200
California AG again is going to be

640
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,059
probably promulgating regulations on

641
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,800
this very topic and it's an opportunity

642
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,740
for business to get involved in if I

643
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,050
said we've we had a representative from

644
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,820
the California AG's office speak in our

645
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,650
office Ellie bloom and she's

646
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,050
specifically called for business comment

647
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,500
on these topics among other things and

648
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,679
then you can also obtain immunity a

649
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,059
company if they want to obtain immunity

650
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,179
for any violations of the CCPA by their

651
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,510
vendors then they must include certain

652
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,880
verbiage in their contracts and a lot of

653
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,660
this does match the verbiage that is in

654
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,580
article 28 in terms of the vendor not

655
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,740
selling the data or using it for any

656
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,250
purpose that's not authorized but then

657
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,630
they're there also should be a

658
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,809
certification that the data will be you

659
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:51,580
know that laws will be complied with and

660
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,160
that those working on working with the

661
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,740
data will maintain confidentiality and

662
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,100
integrity of the data okay and with that

663
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,980
I just we'll wrap up here really quickly

664
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,530
with the defenses so there's some

665
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,940
general defenses and their specific

666
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,590
defenses I'm just going to give you an

667
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,200
overview of some of the general ones

668
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,950
company could say that they're not a

669
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,300
business if they don't meet the

670
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,429
threshold that you're not dealing with

671
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,770
PII personal information is defined in

672
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,980
the statute under 17 98.1 40 oh and

673
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,370
there's some specific things in the P I

674
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,170
definitely you know inference data and

675
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,900
biometrics - which includes facial

676
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,550
recognition for you to pay attention to

677
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,650
but if you're not collecting the things

678
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,230
that are in 1790 8.1 4000 you can take

679
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,100
that

680
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,289
data select is collected for a single

681
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:41,320
one-time transaction you know or the

682
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,789
data would require a business - reaiiy

683
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,029
denta fie information if you're another

684
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:47,650
defense is if the information is

685
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,480
publicly available and you're you are

686
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,279
using it in a way that's consistent with

687
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,110
the way that it was made publicly

688
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,690
available by the user that is another

689
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,179
defense there are political exemptions

690
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:01,240
in the statute for things like data

691
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,970
that's collected pursuant to GL da but

692
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,500
keep in mind those are not a lot of

693
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,960
those defense exemptions have loopholes

694
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,340
in them so you need to really look

695
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,919
closely like you know what for like a

696
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,470
website for a financial institution they

697
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,820
might be collecting cookies for non

698
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,710
customers and they're you know you're

699
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,630
outside of GLBA at that point so just

700
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,179
really look closely at those objections

701
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,000
but you might have abilities to assert

702
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,700
of defense there and or you can't

703
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,230
respond to the request because you don't

704
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,370
have enough information to verify the

705
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,409
identity of the user and look out for

706
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:36,429
guidance from the attorney general's

707
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,539
office in may on that topic we have a

708
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:45,130
legal playbook and in our firm really

709
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,750
about how to preserve the defenses

710
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,419
similar to what we did with gdpr and

711
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:52,779
here's some you know examples of you

712
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,789
know the specific things that could be

713
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,720
included in an abbreviated response and

714
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,760
with that I'm going to turn it over to

715
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,570
Ben feet great thanks

716
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,720
Dominique and you know thanks for this

717
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,320
very easy dive into the different rights

718
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,970
that are available in HTTP a and JP are

719
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,140
for the background - at the beginning

720
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,299
that was very informative and very

721
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:23,020
helpful so I think with that kind of

722
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,899
first part it's first to say that I feel

723
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:28,570
free overwhelming probably especially

724
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,809
for companies is what that are maybe

725
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:34,000
only based in California and we're not

726
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,909
subject to GPR so having been looking in

727
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:39,460
the GDP our consideration for a while

728
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,549
and and there's definitely a lot in both

729
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,179
of these laws and now we're kind of in

730
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,520
that second part going to look at what

731
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:48,880
you can

732
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,390
and practice within your organization to

733
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,760
address all those requirements in the

734
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,440
most efficient way possible

735
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,440
first I'm gonna just take a bit of a

736
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,840
step back and look at the more bigger

737
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,570
pictures because you know today's topic

738
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,560
was with both book logs and that made

739
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,610
just the right step and if it's

740
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,760
definitely the most prominent part

741
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,270
especially to GPA but there is some

742
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,830
there is some other key overlaps in the

743
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,720
law that that we touched on a bit

744
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,050
already but that I will cover in a bit

745
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,410
more details right now so there's some

746
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,150
overlap on the type of data that's

747
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,580
concerned are the entities and the

748
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,500
individuals who are protected

749
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,990
the GTR defines personal data as any

750
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,050
information relating to an identified or

751
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,210
identifiable natural person that the

752
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,210
loss of data subject and and defines an

753
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,430
identifiable person as one who can be

754
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,680
identified directly or indirectly in

755
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,570
particular by reference to an other

756
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,720
identifier online identifier and gives

757
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,690
some other examples as well so bottom

758
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,820
line here is that it's a very very broad

759
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,690
definition and CCPA has an equally broad

760
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,550
definition of what it costs personal

761
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,040
information as information that

762
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,050
identifies really to describe it's

763
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,880
capable of being associated with or

764
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,010
could reasonably be linked directly or

765
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,190
indirectly with a particular consumer or

766
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,040
household important here to kind of

767
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,520
point out this household edition that

768
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,920
you know we don't we don't usually see

769
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,830
and that can add things up pretty

770
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,980
quickly so obvious identifiers and we

771
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,250
know such as name social security number

772
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,110
but also some more interesting ones as

773
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,540
the internet or other network activity

774
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,130
information that includes browsing

775
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:44,020
history search history and there's also

776
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,550
this interesting one that's any

777
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,250
insurance that is drawn from any of this

778
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,650
information it's being used to create a

779
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,030
profile about a consumer

780
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,060
so in CPP as well extremely broad

781
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,000
definition of personal information and

782
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,030
one difference though to note is that

783
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,429
personal information to date

784
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:05,830
include some exception Dominique mention

785
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,540
it a bit earlier and it excludes

786
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,110
publicly available information so it has

787
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,940
a definition of it too which is

788
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,260
information that is lawfully made

789
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,820
available in federal state or local

790
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,540
government records provided that data

791
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,160
used for a purpose compatible with the

792
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,170
ones for which it's maintained and made

793
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,050
available in the record quick note here

794
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,590
also is that TCPA has some exclusion

795
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,760
from its overall a scope of application

796
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,290
and for example medical information

797
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,370
governed by other laws such as any

798
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,720
medical information is governed by the

799
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,520
confidentiality of medical information

800
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,140
acts or another example of exclusion

801
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,610
would be personal information that's

802
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,910
collected process sold or disclose for

803
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,530
students to the gramm-leach-bliley Act

804
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,070
so those are just a few examples but

805
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,260
that can to a certain expand you know

806
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,970
narrow the definition of personal

807
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,880
information and regarding the entities

808
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,760
that are covered there is some of the

809
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,909
PCP a fairly narrower than GTR here

810
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,340
the GTR applies to national or legal

811
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,020
persons so that means people and

812
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,379
companies so that includes associations

813
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:20,739
or non-for-profit public bodies and

814
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,760
institutions whereas as again Dominic

815
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,699
explain a bit earlier CCPA covers only

816
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,489
for-profit entities that do business in

817
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:33,070
California and that meet one of the

818
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,730
threshold that she presented so a bit

819
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,730
narrower in that sense that said the you

820
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,800
know the threshold can be met pretty

821
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,830
easily especially the one in the you

822
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,899
know 50,000 or more consumer household

823
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:49,570
or devices I can add up pretty quickly

824
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,250
and finally so GTR covers data subjects

825
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,590
where it's identifiable natural persons

826
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,810
only so it doesn't include companies and

827
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,359
cgpa covers of consumers more a

828
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,710
California resident very quickly to was

829
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,359
kind of already touched on that but

830
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,940
another area of overlap sensors children

831
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,340
and it's just the you know interesting

832
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,109
point here so to make is that there's a

833
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:15,730
particular attention and

834
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,290
and a recognition that children's data

835
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,300
need a higher level of protection in

836
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,210
some circumstances so CCPA has a blanket

837
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,130
prohibition for the sale of children's

838
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,950
data for children under 16 requires up

839
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,200
in and the parents authorization if the

840
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,560
child is under 13 from the child himself

841
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,440
or herself is under 16 and junichi are

842
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,010
of only that the child consent

843
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,720
requirement only applies in relation to

844
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,130
the offer of information society

845
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,490
services directly to the child so that's

846
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,369
a bit narrower and it requires seeing

847
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,869
the parent consent or the child

848
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:52,420
depending on the age and and those can

849
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,160
vary per member state so there is

850
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,530
undoubtedly some overlap between the two

851
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,440
laws but there are also some important

852
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,350
difference in the GDP re is much broader

853
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,100
than CPP overall the law the European

854
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,300
law applies to the processing of

855
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,609
personal data holyoke certainly by

856
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:15,190
automated means or non automated means

857
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,430
if the data is part of the filing system

858
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,170
and the term processing itself which is

859
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,720
defining the regulation could hardly be

860
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,510
butter and it covers any operation or

861
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,400
set of operation that's performed on

862
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,710
personal data and it includes you

863
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,680
anything collecting using disclosing

864
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,600
that are you know the most obvious ones

865
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,460
but also structuring storing recording

866
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,090
making available and so on the CCPA on

867
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,130
the other hand is the bit narrower and

868
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,140
that obligations are imposed on

869
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,030
businesses that collect sell or disclose

870
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,890
personal information about a consumer

871
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,290
but not to all kinds of operations

872
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,680
performed on that personal information

873
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,950
the GTR is also principal based and

874
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,540
includes the requirement that any

875
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,820
processing performed on personal data be

876
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,490
based on one of the six legal bases that

877
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,980
are available so for example consent

878
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,540
such an interest performance of a

879
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,510
contract to name a few

880
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,310
CCTA does not have such requirement so

881
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,780
you know the main difference here is

882
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,180
TVPA regulate specific aspects of the

883
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,160
processing the cell is a good example

884
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,290
but not kind of the overall treatment

885
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,050
processing of data that the company

886
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,550
holds as GTR does so GDP are also has

887
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,670
many more requirements in comparison to

888
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,650
GDP a for example control of the

889
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,510
processor is must maintain a record of

890
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,880
their processing activities there is the

891
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,670
requirement to perform dpi is in some

892
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,290
circumstances having some type of

893
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,960
safeguards for any transfers personal

894
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,580
data outside of the EU breach

895
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,260
notification requirements appointing a

896
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,770
video etc so this piece EPA is more

897
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,960
focused on providing rights to consumer

898
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,230
to protect them from data misuse and to

899
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,510
acquire transparency from businesses

900
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,140
regarding their personal information so

901
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,900
a bit more focus in the Sun and there's

902
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,790
another main difference it has to do

903
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,980
with vendor management what we'll touch

904
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,590
on that a bit later when when am who

905
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:21,369
talk about that and so you know the CD

906
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,230
itself doesn't include all obligations

907
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,500
that exist in GDP are but you took with

908
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,270
no so that you know California has other

909
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,609
laws that cover some of these areas and

910
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,500
a good example being at the data breach

911
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,210
notification law

912
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,820
so while the goal of GTR was time to

913
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,800
take a broad overall approach to

914
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,750
regulating the processing of personal

915
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,290
data you know businesses that are

916
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,540
subjected to DBA or operating California

917
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,040
these don't may have more privacy or

918
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,230
security security related obligations

919
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,350
and then those strictly contained in 50

920
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,010
day only so finally if you close on the

921
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,960
subject of the overlap and differences

922
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,200
between the two I want to just give a

923
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,240
quick word of advice and reminded the

924
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,760
devil is in the details so even if there

925
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,940
are some apparent similarities it's very

926
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,640
important when it comes to new strict

927
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,060
compliance and implementation within

928
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,950
your organization to look at the

929
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,500
specifics of each

930
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,150
carefully when it comes to scope

931
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,910
definitions exceptions you Dominique

932
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,970
made a good point explained that the the

933
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,010
right of the erasure for GDP are only

934
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,130
apply the circumstances and gave a good

935
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,320
example of how that can kind of you know

936
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,730
come back to your face even if it was

937
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,410
not intended

938
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,190
so we're going to look at how to address

939
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,510
both laws in the most efficient way so

940
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,800
there are some practical steps that you

941
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,600
can take to implement both pieces of

942
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,900
legislation within your organization's

943
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,160
because again while there are some

944
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,520
differences in each in terms of the

945
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,380
specific requirements when it comes to

946
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,140
the processes that you can put in place

947
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,450
internally to comply those can be

948
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,540
leveraged to cover both laws the

949
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,030
facility things to the extent possible

950
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,370
it's good to work on compliance with a

951
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,340
holistic approach and ideally as part of

952
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,650
one kind of global privacy program and

953
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,710
as we're about to see in just a moment

954
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,420
there are lots of areas that can be

955
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,970
approached you know again globally and

956
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,800
then the actual process itself or

957
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,450
incorporates with the differences

958
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,650
between the two laws and now met Andrew

959
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,900
I start with that yes thank you for that

960
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,430
important to go over the key overlaps

961
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,130
and differences and now we'd like to

962
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,440
take a look at the you know the

963
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,590
operational steps that are important and

964
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,200
reaction to these rights and kind of get

965
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,210
get to the action that you can be taking

966
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,540
right now so a good place to start would

967
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,460
be to understand what your organization

968
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,220
does already and has in place and one of

969
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,320
the reasons for this format and thinking

970
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,300
about the the GTR in relations to the

971
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,790
CCPA is that we're trying to see where

972
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,010
you might be able to leverage work that

973
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,410
that's been well done or something that

974
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,740
you used before that can be tailored for

975
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,290
this is usually a good place to start

976
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,060
and our readiness assessment is a great

977
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,820
way for you to figure out where your

978
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,920
gaps are and make sure that you

979
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,240
understand the points that need to be

980
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,190
addressed and the measures and processes

981
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,440
that you need to put in place and order

982
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,110
should be ready some of these resources

983
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,020
will focus totally on the CCPA

984
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,390
other resources are more comprehensive

985
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,340
and will allow you to assess readiness

986
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,250
with one questionnaire again multiple

987
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,120
regime like the gdpr and the CCPA so

988
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,970
that that sometimes can be the best

989
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,890
approach because it will give you the

990
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,540
best

991
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,720
overall view to where the organization

992
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,210
is in its readiness and when do you

993
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:01,870
think about starting it's important to

994
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,200
think about starting now so there's

995
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,490
something that's referred to as the

996
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,750
look-back requirement the look-back

997
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,350
requirement like an example would be the

998
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,690
right to request access looks about 12

999
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,210
months of the previous 12 months and

1000
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,040
since the enforcement date is January

1001
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,120
1st 2020 you should be already trying to

1002
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,980
get your records in place make some

1003
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,780
accurate and findable in such a way that

1004
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,030
is going to be something that you can

1005
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,750
achieve that on the effective date and

1006
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,720
so perhaps the best way to make things

1007
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,570
findable is to start with updating or

1008
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,400
maybe to just beginning and data

1009
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,670
inventory and record-keeping process

1010
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,620
that your company so if you have

1011
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,910
experience with the gdpr

1012
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,780
you'll be familiar with these steps and

1013
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,610
you'll already have a great starting

1014
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,640
point so you shouldn't be reinventing

1015
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,380
the wheel here but as you've seen

1016
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,450
through previous presenters there are

1017
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,220
important details that are different

1018
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,370
here so you're not simply extending the

1019
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,760
same point in order to to cover this

1020
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,680
there are some new obligations that need

1021
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,690
to be captured and it's also worth

1022
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,880
pointing out that this this is an

1023
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,550
activity that in support of other

1024
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,980
activities right so this is something

1025
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,950
that needs to be done in order to carry

1026
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,910
out other requests it's not in itself

1027
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,110
you know the requirement that you're

1028
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,670
trying to be the thing that's supporting

1029
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,810
the requirements that you're trying to

1030
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,090
be so the first step here of creating a

1031
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,340
map a record of processing activities is

1032
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,760
so that when you are going to receive a

1033
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,870
data subject request you are able to do

1034
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,300
proper fulfillment of that request if

1035
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,400
there is a breach that you'd be able to

1036
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,690
map back where necessary and and learn

1037
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,380
as quickly as you can what's going on

1038
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,569
when we talk about risk assessments and

1039
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,049
CIA's later having good awareness of the

1040
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,630
processing that's happening within your

1041
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,959
company and if GE PR is not an area of

1042
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:16,529
overlap for you you may find that there

1043
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,209
are some things you can leverage on the

1044
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:21,299
security side of things many companies

1045
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:25,499
will have a program such as ISO 27001

1046
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,410
that at least had an asset map that can

1047
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,599
be a starting point that leads you down

1048
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,559
the road to collecting the right

1049
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,199
information that would be important for

1050
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,589
your records in this case so highlight a

1051
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:45,829
few we should be looking here

1052
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:48,749
understanding the categories of personal

1053
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:50,969
information collected but also

1054
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:53,549
importantly what is sold the specific

1055
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:56,309
pieces of was collected the categories

1056
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:59,339
of the sources the purpose for not only

1057
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,079
collecting but also selling and the

1058
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,049
categories of third parties with whom

1059
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:06,719
you share so you can think about this as

1060
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:08,670
in the context of the example of the

1061
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,400
right for information request and I

1062
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,549
think it becomes clear how this would be

1063
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:16,769
useful I should also point out from a

1064
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:20,640
practical point of view that this is

1065
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,890
another area where integrations with

1066
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,709
other processes and tools can be

1067
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:29,459
important the the obvious integration

1068
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,289
here being one with how it is that

1069
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:33,900
you're going to receive your dated

1070
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,509
subject requests may want to try to get

1071
00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:38,420
some integration in place there to make

1072
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,599
that more helpful so just look back

1073
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:45,809
across what's important we're talking

1074
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,839
about enabling the fulfillment of

1075
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,269
consumer rights request through through

1076
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:53,180
this data inventory we're identifying

1077
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,160
the flows and where and whether

1078
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,890
something is sold and again we're

1079
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,019
looking to get this done as soon as

1080
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:04,949
possible due to look this look-back

1081
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:07,910
requirement that that says stay here

1082
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,400
records need to be in order so I will

1083
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,549
hand this back

1084
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:15,249
you for a few additional tests one of

1085
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:17,109
these and then I'll pick it up again for

1086
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:19,410
you

1087
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,609
yes great thanks Andrew

1088
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:24,369
so our third step here is to look at the

1089
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:26,459
privacy notice and and policies

1090
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:30,279
generally so both TPPA and gdpr have

1091
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:32,439
requirements around the information that

1092
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:35,249
as a business you need to disclose to

1093
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:38,259
individual for the sake of time I won't

1094
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:42,579
give too much details on those but in

1095
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:45,400
CCPA businesses must disclose to

1096
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,739
consumers the calories of personal

1097
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,420
information we collected purposes of the

1098
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,779
use the right consumers have and that

1099
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:55,390
the business personal information and

1100
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,249
that consumers have a right to opt out

1101
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:00,189
there's some information to disclose in

1102
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:02,199
the online privacy policy if the

1103
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:05,140
business has one so this is you know all

1104
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,900
included in NC GPA and GPA are

1105
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,640
addressing the information to be

1106
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,920
provided to individuals in article 13

1107
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,130
and 14 it's a bit more broader than cgpa

1108
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,689
includes things like identity and

1109
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:21,670
contact details of the controller the

1110
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,529
purposes of processing as well as the

1111
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,989
legal basis and of course the rights

1112
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:27,999
that people have so you know main point

1113
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,539
here from and kind of operationalize

1114
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:33,339
operational I'm sorry standpoint it's to

1115
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:36,189
kind of you know take a bigger view of

1116
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:38,499
this look at your notice and see how you

1117
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:39,939
can kind of incorporate all the

1118
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:42,789
requirements from each and organize it

1119
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:45,339
in a you know a proper within the notice

1120
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:48,999
so it works for both your residents and

1121
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,189
and California residents as well so for

1122
00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:52,539
example how they use kind of a big

1123
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,630
you're right section and depending on on

1124
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,239
how as a company you know whether you

1125
00:47:58,239 --> 00:47:59,769
want to take the global approach grants

1126
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:01,479
rights to more people than you have to

1127
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,170
or not organized you're known as

1128
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,349
accordingly

1129
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,709
and one and of course you know we've

1130
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:11,469
talked about this extensively and and

1131
00:48:11,469 --> 00:48:13,479
rights are really at the heart of each

1132
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:17,949
of these laws so one you know crucial

1133
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,660
aspect here for whether it's for data

1134
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,929
subject request under GTR or consumer

1135
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:24,160
request

1136
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,980
under CGPA that it will be for your

1137
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,280
business to have a very solid process in

1138
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,420
place to kind of handle on manage though

1139
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,300
so there are several things to consider

1140
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,280
for that purpose so the first one is how

1141
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,980
as an organization you're labeling or

1142
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,340
facilitating those rights such requests

1143
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,040
from people so CPA does require at a

1144
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,930
minimum that you provide a toll-free

1145
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,300
telephone number and website address if

1146
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:57,220
your business has a website gzr you know

1147
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,140
only mentioned that you do need to

1148
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,450
facilitate and enable those it doesn't

1149
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,580
have specific requirements like CCPA

1150
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,890
does but you know you can think of

1151
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,270
different ways you can offer

1152
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,330
standardized web form on your website or

1153
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,880
other means of submission you can have

1154
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,680
the dedicated call centre customer

1155
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,860
support and person etc asset those are

1156
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,070
definitely aspects to think about the

1157
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,950
second kind of second aspect is what is

1158
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,420
expected of their employees will receive

1159
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,810
the request and how to handle them

1160
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:31,690
so that you know imply depending on the

1161
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,390
nature of your business to understand

1162
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,890
who within your organization with

1163
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,860
employee are likely to receive this

1164
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,960
request to make sure that you don't miss

1165
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,300
one again under you know both laws it's

1166
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,600
very high fines or or suspensions

1167
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,160
total it's very important not to miss

1168
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,260
one there are strict timelines to

1169
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,590
respond to individual so you know need

1170
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,960
to make sure that you capture those the

1171
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,660
review process for each request as well

1172
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,790
so what action should be taken what kind

1173
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,640
of you know workflow process you want to

1174
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,820
take to manage those under a GP are you

1175
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,250
I need to make sure called verifying the

1176
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,740
identity of the person so you basically

1177
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,540
just making sure of course this person

1178
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,820
that you receive the request from is you

1179
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,100
know the actual person that's making it

1180
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,890
and under CCPA is called a verifiable

1181
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,290
consumer request and this there will be

1182
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:27,460
more the AG is expected to take issue

1183
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,470
regulations to explain the details on

1184
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,600
how to verify those but there is kind of

1185
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,970
stuff

1186
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,060
verifying the identity of the person

1187
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,000
and also whether it is applicable so for

1188
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,100
you know both is supposed to be free of

1189
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,550
charge but then if you get manifestly

1190
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,130
Iranian or excessive request or to cover

1191
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,740
administrative costs if people ask for

1192
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,260
additional copies for example those are

1193
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,090
instances where you may request to see

1194
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,160
so that's another you know things to

1195
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,660
figure out

1196
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,070
and then how requests will be carried

1197
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,320
out internally so that's obviously the

1198
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,900
key and as you know Andrew explained a

1199
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,150
few minutes ago this is nice when you

1200
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,770
have proper data inventory so you know

1201
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,170
exactly where to look and who don't ask

1202
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,270
to obtain the data delete the data or

1203
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:17,030
rectify etc and finally you know the

1204
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,230
response fees and responding to data

1205
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,690
subjects so you need to make sure that

1206
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,950
you have a secure and effective process

1207
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,290
to respond and transmit data

1208
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,770
it's portable and as I mentioned for

1209
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,570
clean as well the the required time line

1210
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,890
so GPR the standard 30 days since BPA's

1211
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,630
45 days so you know again kind of

1212
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,900
approach this as a whole it would be

1213
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,550
it's good to think about creating

1214
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,280
different template responses so that you

1215
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,530
can standardize as much as possible

1216
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,070
those responses to people based on which

1217
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,160
regulation is fake and maybe also want

1218
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,490
to be putting this overall process or

1219
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,730
checklist into a company policy or SOP

1220
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,280
our stuff here is provide this off south

1221
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,340
a mechanism so this one is specific to

1222
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,640
CCP a which has a very size requirement

1223
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,950
that's the business provide a do not

1224
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,770
sell my personal information button to

1225
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,170
enable you know consumers to easily

1226
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,120
exercise this right to apply on the

1227
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,460
cells their personal information so if

1228
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,400
you're using a tool to manage your

1229
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,660
consumer or data subject requests you

1230
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,760
may think about a time that one to your

1231
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,720
standard workflow as well to capture it

1232
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,890
there and you know just a few very

1233
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,080
important consideration here will be to

1234
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,080
accurately track when that up south is

1235
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,530
made by a consumer and there's two main

1236
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,070
reasons

1237
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,770
here and one the business that needs to

1238
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,900
stop selling that information S or the

1239
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,860
requested me so that's pretty obvious

1240
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,140
and the second one is that there's the

1241
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,610
possibility of the business to reach out

1242
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,580
to the customer 12 months after as to

1243
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,170
ask if they would authorize the sale

1244
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,260
again but that you know implies knowing

1245
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,210
when when it's safe to do so

1246
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:16,460
so when the opt-out was made precisely

1247
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:26,760
Andrew Android on you okay yes thanks

1248
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,450
let me pick out the training so training

1249
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,210
is often dealt with something that would

1250
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,430
be good to have in this case it is a

1251
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,500
requirement Pat so we should definitely

1252
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,000
take a moment to make sure that we

1253
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,550
understand this teeth you look at 1798

1254
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,090
130 and 135 you'll see that the scope is

1255
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,220
not everyone in the entire company but

1256
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,840
the individual is responsible for

1257
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,360
handling the consumer inquiry so that's

1258
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,880
an important to note and those

1259
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,530
individuals need to be informed of all

1260
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,430
the requirements and how to direct to

1261
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,130
consumers to exercise their rights so in

1262
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,000
this case we're going to certainly focus

1263
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,010
on that that training aspect but there's

1264
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,070
a secondary piece here which implies

1265
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,810
that there's probably policies and

1266
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,460
processes that need to be updated in

1267
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,160
order to make these changes and also

1268
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,650
perhaps updating to marketing as well to

1269
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,320
make sure that that communication is

1270
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,930
happening additionally it's probably a

1271
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,870
best practice in this case to set up

1272
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,910
some sort of verification that the

1273
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,820
training is working you know quizzes

1274
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,830
could be collected there might be a

1275
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,840
regular schedule that's put in place and

1276
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,020
this is an area where because the GPR

1277
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,090
didn't have a specific requirement you

1278
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,840
might not be able to leverage some of

1279
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,260
you or your previous work and that said

1280
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,890
I do think that one of the things to

1281
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,440
focus on would be the recognition of the

1282
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,480
request already we've noted

1283
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,010
discussion about needing to have

1284
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:03,520
hundred-number or if you have a website

1285
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,010
a place to make a request via the web I

1286
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,599
think this is an area that we want to

1287
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,190
spend a little bit more time learning

1288
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,750
about once there is additional

1289
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,820
information and details on what this

1290
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:16,060
needs to look like but I think you know

1291
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,980
it's possible that there will be other

1292
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,560
means that these requests are coming in

1293
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,730
and you want to make sure that it's

1294
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,450
there

1295
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:26,320
they're not missing out all right few

1296
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,220
quick additional actions to be taken

1297
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,470
J'son privacy by design is not one of

1298
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,599
the required things but it's a piece

1299
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,089
that helps manage overall risk and is

1300
00:55:37,089 --> 00:55:40,329
going to assist with the overall program

1301
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:43,619
strength than responding to the CCPA so

1302
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,930
specifically you're probably going to be

1303
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,900
looking proactively inventing privacy

1304
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,460
throughout the business this is the goal

1305
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,130
of privacy by design but the task that

1306
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,910
you'll be carrying out are integrating

1307
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,589
probably tasks like privacy impact

1308
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,900
assessments throughout the business to

1309
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,280
make sure that you're taking care of

1310
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,560
these things and a way to map this back

1311
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,290
I think is that although there isn't a

1312
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,150
specific requirements for privacy by

1313
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:14,980
design it does show up within the CCPA

1314
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,990
that there are Fair Information practice

1315
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,750
principles and in order to react to

1316
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:23,550
those principles this is one of you were

1317
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,720
best approaches it's also a good time to

1318
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,460
remember that you are not alone in your

1319
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,329
obligations here this is a shared

1320
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:37,720
responsibility and take a moment to look

1321
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,569
out at your network of privacy champions

1322
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:43,089
if you have them you don't this would be

1323
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:45,099
a good time to start building them and

1324
00:56:45,099 --> 00:56:48,910
make sure that that your goal of

1325
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,950
speaking privacy into all the areas of

1326
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,109
the businesses is carried out by making

1327
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,490
sure that there are other people that

1328
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,500
are you know an extension of your team

1329
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,710
that are aware of that needs to be going

1330
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:03,040
on and possibly will be participating in

1331
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,359
that training that you just spoke about

1332
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:06,990
and then the final piece here is that

1333
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,700
vendor management is something that was

1334
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,250
very clear in the GPR to go to art

1335
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,619
twenty-eight the requirements were very

1336
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:16,869
precise the contract had to include

1337
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:19,210
specific septic matter talk about the

1338
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,950
duration of processing the nature and

1339
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,930
the purpose of the processing the types

1340
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,170
of personal data etc and the CCPA

1341
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:29,980
there's a little bit lighter detail on

1342
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,430
how this works but Dominique pointed out

1343
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,200
earlier it's an incredibly important

1344
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,450
piece of the puzzle so you're going to

1345
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,420
want to make sure that you know for

1346
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,770
example if there's a deletion request

1347
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,990
and you're going to be able to go to

1348
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,550
your vendor in there they're going to

1349
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,170
know how to work with you and have the

1350
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,690
obligation to work with you and I think

1351
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,349
that review is best carry that through a

1352
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:55,810
comprehensive process of vendor

1353
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,020
management two other quick items

1354
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,190
obviously once I've put together a full

1355
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,170
response solution for this but there are

1356
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,609
some tools that are made available

1357
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,800
specifically that I think would be nice

1358
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,170
to highlight you know one is our mobile

1359
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,660
app that quick search the full text and

1360
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,470
CTA can highlight bookmark thing and get

1361
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:20,440
news updates and hopefully get a chance

1362
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,089
to operationalize some of the things

1363
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:25,390
that we spoke about today and as you're

1364
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,960
working toward a lot of these new

1365
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,410
program objectives is sometimes helped

1366
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,420
to talk to others and we've announced

1367
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,570
our 2019 schedule for privacy connect

1368
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,330
which has 100 you know positive and 80

1369
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,270
cities and good coverage of the CCPA so

1370
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,099
hopefully we can share some practical

1371
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:48,190
tips there and you can also sign up to

1372
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,530
participate in monthly thought

1373
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,380
leadership webinars in in that case as

1374
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,720
well well I guess I'll hand this back to

1375
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,200

you were looking for we got a number of

1382
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:13,089

throughout the program we've answered

1384
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,080

1387
00:59:20,859 --> 00:59:22,390
export some of the questions and go

1388
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,349
through them and were going to try to

1389

1439
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:18,940

1453
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,740
continuing legal education or CME

1454
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,190
