1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,060
getting the PLS was important to me

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,509
because it comes with the backing of two

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,400
really globally recognized institutions

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,559
the American Bar Association and the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:10,910
International Association of privacy

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,710
professionals and so the fact that they

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,349
came together to join forces to offer

8
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,050
this specialist designation that is one

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,910
of only a handful of destinations that

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,190
the the ABA recognizes was really

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,289
special and the fact that I got to apply

12
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,000
for this designation in a field that I

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,769
really loved practicing law in privacy

14
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,699
law was really a made an easy decision

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,649
I would recommend it because of the

16
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,179
rigor that's involved in obtaining it

17
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,550
and and also how highly recognized it is

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,190
already because it has that infra mater

19
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,710
of the ABA and the IEP p2

20
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,269
internationally recognized organizations

21
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,639
that's really a special thing and I

22
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,799
think a lot of other privacy attorneys

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,989
and probably I would say legal

24
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:52,909
recruiters recognize this it's

25
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,769
definitely a competitive advantage over

26
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:57,589
others and something that I'm proud to

27
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,709
have and that's why I was proud to be in

28
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,269
the inaugural class to obtain it because

29
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:03,529
I knew from the start this is something

30
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:06,040
I wanted to have
