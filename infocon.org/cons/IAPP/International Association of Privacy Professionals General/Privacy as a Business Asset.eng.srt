00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,910
what value do you place on privacy I'm

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,490
sure your organization says that privacy

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,670
is important but how do you invest in it

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,429
how do you contribute to better privacy

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,320
for your customers and for your

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,990
organization in this video we're going

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,330
to hear from some global privacy leaders

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,150
as they talk about investing and the

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,570
value of privacy we are in a changing

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,890
time right now

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,430
the GD P R has brought about fines that

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,640
are significant any large multinational

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,760
company is going to feel some pain if

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860
they get caught in that I sometimes talk

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,539
about the sign that we see so often in

17
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,190
we go in in restrooms in restaurant

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,930
where it says employees must wash hands

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,390
before going back to work and every time

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,539
I see that sign I think to myself I

21
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,879
really hope they do that I really hope

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,010
they do that is kind of like where we

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,230
are today with many companies and their

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,049
corporate training for privacy it's like

25
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,270
you give them the training in exact well

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,640
I really hope they do that companies

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,460
today know that data protection is an

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,770
important issue in fact in a recent

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,270
survey seventy-five percent of

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,939
respondents said that data protection is

31
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,479
a top digital risk on the flip side

32
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,479
though those same respondents only 35

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,549
percent believed that their senior

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,030
management saw it as a serious issue

35
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,189
that's a major disconnect think of it as

36
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,930
you know the difference between talking

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,700
the talk and walking the walk if there's

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,829
a saying that the price of Liberty is

39
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,439
eternal vigilance I like to think of

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,479
that saying and swap it out and said the

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,659
price of privacy is eternal vigilance if

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,270
you think what works today is gonna save

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,520
you tomorrow

44
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,020
you're probably gonna find yourself in a

45
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,060
bad situation in the future and if you

46
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,870
don't think through how you're going to

47
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,570
manage that data and create consensus

48
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,840
for it and protect it and secure it in

49
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,630
your in your company you could end up

50
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,149
two years three years five years down

51
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,790
the line without a business quite

52
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,970
honestly certainly plans are necessary

53
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,850
but you can't just write a privacy

54
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,950
policy and put it in a file and think

55
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,620
that you are done it has to be a living

56
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,440
breathing program your business

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,800
imperatives employee education changes

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,320
in the marketplace all of them are going

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,720
to demand that you create a smart and

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,110
flexible program because when you become

61
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,380
complacent and aren't contemplating

62
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,200
emerging topics looking at trends of

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,730
issues that might have occurred in the

64
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,890
past making sure that they don't occur

65
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,440
again then you're really not being

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,690
strategic in your vision when there is a

67
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,459
breach as well when something goes wrong

68
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,920
the regulators are going to look much

69
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,380
more favorably on an organization that

70
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,110
has actually put in place policies

71
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,690
procedures that has got privacy officer

72
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,060
then organization who hasn't done

73
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,010
anything whatsoever I think part of the

74
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,290
brand of your your company your

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,790
organization is that you become known as

76
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,160
an organization that can be trusted with

77
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,500
privacy and that I think is only going

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,170
to create greater business opportunities

79
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,070
because data privacy is not a matter of

80
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,170
just complying with law it can be used

81
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,640
in a way that makes people comfortable

82
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,400
enough to allow them to be benefited

83
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,170
from it you probably should be paying

84
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,850
attention to the risk associated with

85
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,280
privacy but if you're forward-looking

86
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,959
if you're thinking about the digital

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,900
economy and how your customers use your

88
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,940
digital services you're going to be

89
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,040
using privacy in a proactive and

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,760
positive way
