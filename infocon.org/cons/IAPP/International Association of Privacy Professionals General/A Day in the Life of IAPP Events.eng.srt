1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,599
when you think about iapp in the context

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,200
of other events ipp is very unique

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
there's no other conference

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,640
that assembles as many people in

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
different sectors of the privacy

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,160
community and there's something very

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,960
collaborative and rewarding about people

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
coming together from their different

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
backgrounds for the common good of

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,479
solving challenges that impact the

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,040
entire society

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
i'm standing outside of the exhibit hall

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,239
where i'm getting ready to head into the

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,640
general session excited for my first

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
dose of inspiration

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,640
let's go

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
i'm here now at a five minute mixer

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,120
which is one of the networking

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,600
opportunities we got a lot of people

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
deep in conversation trying to make the

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,239
most out of a very limited time but

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,559
in that limited time it seems like a lot

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,120
of enduring connections are made the

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
content delivered through the lecture

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,680
series it's a fantastic way to

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,119
engage with your peers while you're

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,840
working through practical applications

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,799
of privacy challenges and there's

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
nothing like understanding how your

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
peers are solving some of the same

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,479
problems that you face day in and day

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
out at work

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
now getting ready to head to the next

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
event which is over at the exhibit hall

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
where the vendor showroom is located

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
[Music]

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,119
now that we've had an opportunity to

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
kind of survey the scene from up above

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,240
in the clouds

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
not the cloud where you store your data

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
but you know what i mean we are going to

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
go down we are going to

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,040
walk around

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
check out some of the latest and

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
greatest solutions and

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
you know here's some good pitches i've

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
attended multiple privacy lectures

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
caught up with some peers met some new

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,640
friends i'm feeling

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,399
positive happy i'm feeling encouraged

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,360
i'm feeling also a sense of you know

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
curiosity that

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
is is constantly being piqued by just

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
having the opportunity to be around

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
others that are similarly excited and

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
optimistic about contributing to the

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,150
field

58
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,880
