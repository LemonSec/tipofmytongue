00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,370
I've been working on user centered

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,500
design in the privacy space for a long

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,269
time now I think that often when we

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,259
develop privacy tools the user side is

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,859
the most often forgotten side you know

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,330
it's great that we have sophisticated

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,580
privacy controls but if they don't make

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,859
sense to users then users won't use them

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,560
they'll ignore them they may not even be

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,740
aware that they exist in the first place

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,040
and so the way to improve on that is to

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,800
actually do studies with users and find

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,469
out first of all what users are looking

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,980
for what their needs are from a privacy

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,030
tool and then and then to test your

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,980
prototypes with users and see what's

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,090
working what's not working and do it in

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,340
context so you can show somebody an

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,350
interface and point to it and say hey do

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,059
you know what this button is all right

21
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,219
can you this is wording makes sense and

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,230
they might you know give you a pretty

23
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,989
good answer but if instead you point

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,970
somebody in a privacy tool and ask them

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,439
how they would accomplish a specific

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,170
task or what do they think they could do

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,180
with this interface now in context it

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,820
may turn out that they have no idea and

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,700
it's actually need needs a lot of work

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,979
to be improved so that's the kind of

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,680
work that we've been doing in in our lab

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,380
at Carnegie Mellon working with users

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,869
and trying to find approaches to address

34
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,060
these sorts of problems so I think

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,450
companies need to loop users into the

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,479
process from the beginning so they need

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,740
to do surveys or focus groups with their

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,810
customers or the types of people who are

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,110
in their target audience find out what

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,020
their needs are related to privacy what

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,790
their preconceived notions are related

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,060
to privacy and make sure that their

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,770
privacy interfaces address those needs

44
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,049
once they have interfaces either

45
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,180
prototype or it is already existing in

46
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,159
their products they need to actually

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,560
test with users from that target

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,959
population to make sure that it's

49
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,879
actually working for users
