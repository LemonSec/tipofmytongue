2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,430
privacy is a complex and challenging

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,220
risk in today's world one of the

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,740
greatest sources of privacy risk are

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,440
your employees because every time they

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,660
touch data or make a decision about data

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,840
they can create privacy exposure for you

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,330
in this video we're going to hear from

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,119
global privacy experts on how to create

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,689
a culture of privacy to help address

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,170
those risks and help improve privacy for

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,780
your company the way to get people to

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,940
lead and believe in privacy is to make

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,620
it everybody's business to bring it to

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,320
their own why does it matter to you why

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
does it matter to what you do and then

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,280
to make it really a business issue why

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,860
is privacy critical for our business if

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,329
you don't create a culture of privacy

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,160
within an organization though what your

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,920
risk is the fact that you have a strong

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,449
legal department that really understands

23
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,789
the issue you may even have a really

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,050
strong engineering department that

25
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,309
understands the issue but there are

26
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,390
going to be gaps throughout your

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,820
organization where that awareness will

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,670
not exist you need smart people in the

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,820
right places making good decisions now

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,470
that doesn't mean that every person in

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,799
your organization has to be a PhD in

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,780
privacy it's not going to happen

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,000
what you need is role based

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,549
understanding so that someone has the

35
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,740
ability to understand that a privacy

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,869
issue is in front of them and either

37
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,689
resolve it or elevate it appropriately

38
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,970
that everybody understands that even

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,340
somebody who doesn't handle personal

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,220
information or data at all in their day

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,960
to day activities when they do stumble

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,670
upon it even by mistake they need to

43
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,829
understand how it imported it is to the

44
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,200
organization you have to make sure that

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,869
the workforce understands privacy is a

46
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,140
team sport everybody plays anytime they

47
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,170
touch a piece of personal information

48
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,930
they know they have to follow the

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,049
correct processes and procedures a

50
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,670
comprehensive privacy training program

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,159
can alter your corporate culture and

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,869
turn something that may have been a

53
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,810
weakness into a strength at the same

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,520
time if something bad does happen

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,070
a good privacy training program will

56
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,010
help shorten response times and improve

57
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,190
your overall results we all know that

58
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,620
there are going to be data breaches it's

59
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,020
the understanding of what a data breach

60
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,320
is it's how to try to prevent it it's

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,020
how to manage it when it occurs those

62
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,090
are the issues that are part of the

63
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,040
training and education and awareness

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,350
that needs to occur the front page of

65
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,180
the New York Times no institution wants

66
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,670
their name there aligned with the mishap

67
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,640
you need to have those people trained to

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,890
understand how your company's thinking

69
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,080
about the issue of privacy what the

70
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,360
guidelines are internally your company

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,910
for how data will be handled as well as

72
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,800
making it personal to every single

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,510
person at the company we all have

74
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,850
responsibility for treating each other's

75
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,590
data the way we'd want our own data

76
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,690
treated your customers have a lot of

77
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,450
expectations of your company when they

78
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,400
engage with you they expect that you're

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,740
going to manage their data in fact they

80
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,330
expect that you're gonna manage their

81
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,920
data well in today's world it is without

82
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,740
question that your customers expect you

83
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,530
are going to do right with their data I

84
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,680
think you just have to train over and

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,040
over again and you want to train to the

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,250
point where the workforce considers

87
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,220
privacy not to be something that they

88
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,780
have to do that they have to check the

89
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,230
box but you want to train to the point

90
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,030
where privacy becomes just this innate

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,060
value to the individual person in the

92
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,740
workforce

93
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,290
that they think of it almost like muscle

94
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,320
memory still a recent study showed that

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,840
less than half of organizations are

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,040
requiring privacy training in the end if

97
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,740
your employees can't make good decisions

98
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,020
about data if when they are presented

99
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,020
with a choice about privacy they don't

100
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,500
know how to make a good decision your

101
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,320
efforts aren't going to fail and so you

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,780
have to invest in employee training

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,600
without privacy we may not have trust we

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,610
may not be able to sell our products we

105
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,200
may not be able to engage with our

106
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,970
business partners because there's going

107
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,380
to be competitor who's going to be

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,690
better if we don't do this right it's

109
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,960
also understanding the lifeblood of your

110
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,140
organization in this digital economy is

111
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,860
data and that means getting privacy

112
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,560
right

113
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,649
