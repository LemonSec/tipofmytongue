1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,120
so at NIST we're working to develop the

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,279
privacy framework which we envision as a

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,830
voluntary tool for enterprise risk

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,960
management we've seen that it's a real

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,150
challenge for organizations to design

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,429
and operate technologies that are

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,310
mindful of diverse privacy needs and so

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,109
many of these technologies are fueled by

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,930
so much data so we think that the

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,789
privacy framework can help organizations

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,150
to consider how their systems products

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,570
and services affect individuals and

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,949
manage privacy risks so they can

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,840
optimize the beneficial uses of data

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,420
while minimizing adverse effects to

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,910
individuals privacy so we kicked off

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,550
this effort in October 2018 and it's

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,530
been a very collaborative approach with

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,989
stakeholders from across sectors there

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,539
are workshops public comment periods and

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,969
webinars everything is still in draft

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,370
form so we encourage feedback absolutely

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,320
as to where we work toward getting to

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,710
version 1.0 and so a few attributes of

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,940
the framework we've introduced that

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,100
we've heard a lot of support for the

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,260
framework is a risk-based its outcome

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,869
based and non-prescriptive which allows

29
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,310
it to be used by a variety of

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,409
organizations of different sizes in

31
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,450
different sectors with different mission

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,880
and business objectives the framework

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,890
has accessible language so it's usable

34
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,229
by not only privacy professionals but

35
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,390
non privacy professionals as well and

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,670
it's agnostic to any particular legal

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,770
regime so it can be used across

38
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,990
different jurisdictions the structure of

39
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,759
the privacy framework parallels that of

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,350
the cybersecurity framework because

41
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,430
we've heard from a lot of our

42
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,079
stakeholders they're interested in using

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,820
both in tandem and so this will

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,430
facilitate that process that said for

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,659
those who want to use the privacy

46
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,100
framework and don't intend to use a

47
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,689
cybersecurity framework it can

48
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,630
absolutely be used on its own too so

49
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,619
thanks to our engaging stakeholders

50
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,390
who've been giving us so much feedback

51
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,670
we're making good progress on developing

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,140
the framework and we're planning to

53
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,399
release it later this year
