1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,090
with respect to the California consumer

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,980
Privacy Act of 2018 the most important

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,210
thing that companies should focus on

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,550
right now is the decision whether they

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,450
will engage in selling of person

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,189
information as this is defined in the

7
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,890
law the definition is very

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,320
counterintuitive to many companies the

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,989
first reaction is we don't sell personal

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,940
information but if they closer review of

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,270
the situation usually results in a

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,280
finding that there are a lot of data

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,600
sharing arrangements that meet the

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,110
definition in companies in most spaces

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,920
can actually opt to stop selling

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,570
personal information the way this is

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,370
defined if that's what they choose to do

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,860
and they should have that discussion now

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,270
and think about where the California

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,159
consumer Privacy Act will take them if

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,729
they either continue on the current path

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,030
or they make changes so that they're not

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,930
engaged in selling

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,689
if they continue to do what they're

25
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,310
doing now they will have to put a

26
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,490
prominent link on every web and mobile

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,670
page where California residents can

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,970
access data and by necessity leave some

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,439
personal information snippets IP

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
addresses and other things that are just

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,560
required to respond to a query and this

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,330
link will have to say the words do not

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,570
sell my person information and it has to

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,810
be conspicuous invisible and it will be

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,140
utterly confusing and very irritating to

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,060
people in other states and other

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,130
countries where they're not familiar

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,289
with the history of this law and where

39
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,890
they thinking selling means you give my

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,830
named user information that what they

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,170
think about personal information for

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,420
cash payments or other transactions like

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,600
this what the statute covers as well but

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,480
the statute covers much more it even

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,250
covers exchanges with service providers

46
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,450
if they're not restricted to to the

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,610
letter of this law so if the company

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,470
puts that link up there and they get up

49
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,930
touts after January 1 2020 then they

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,680
will have to cut off the sharing with

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,829
any company where they didn't qualify

52
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,630
the relationship is not involving

53
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,410
selling and they will not be allowed to

54
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,329
discriminate against the user who opted

55
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,980
out so they will have to continue to

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,350
provide the service most companies have

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,299
extended enterprises with a whole suite

58
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:54,780
of software service providers and if

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,269
they start getting opt-outs that they

60
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,280
cannot use certain systems anymore they

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,230
would have to rebuild on-premise systems

62
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,750
or other things that would be quite

63
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,480
difficult to create so companies should

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,769
think about that they should think about

65
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,140
that if somebody has opted out they

66
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,299
cannot prompt them for an opt-in with

67
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,540
the next 12 month most companies with

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,190
different landing pages cannot really

69
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,890
control whether there are prompts to opt

70
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,530
in certain things with a different set

71
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,630
of privacy terms that easily because

72
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,130
they would have to identify people and

73
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,660
see that somebody's already opted out

74
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,910
and there would be a lot of

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,670
different systems to have to be built if

76
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,730
the company says we will continue to do

77
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,080
whatever we're doing now and doesn't

78
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,570
eliminate the selling on the other hand

79
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,880
if the company does eliminate the

80
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,700
selling it will be quite painful in some

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,860
areas where right now the whole

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,810
ecosystem involves sharing of

83
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,330
information for the benefit of their

84
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,180
customers and that are not ready to

85
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,490
support their customers without sharing

86
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,110
arrangements that could still qualify a

87
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,820
selling of person information so I'm not

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,800
saying that is necessarily the easier

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,730
way but it does avoid that ugly link on

90
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,480
every page and mobile page and website

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
that would be definitely have a negative

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
brand on brand impact on companies so

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,790
that's the big decision that companies

94
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,760
should do right now if they haven't

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,270
already done
