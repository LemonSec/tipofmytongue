1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
so I think that the privacy framework

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,350
highlights the need for a diverse and

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,720
well-trained workforce in the privacy

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,700
space we've heard from a lot of

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,650
stakeholders the need for a broad

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,110
variety of perspectives in terms of

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,570
identifying assessing and responding to

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,430
privacy risks so when the draft

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,350
framework that we've released we did

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,420
include language around the importance

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,730
of these collaborative diverse teams to

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,189
do privacy risk management and to that

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,750
end in our development of the framework

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,179
where we're crafting it in such a way

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,130
that it can be used by a wide variety of

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,559
rules so in the core of the framework we

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,020
have various levels of abstraction at

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,149
the highest level of abstraction we

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,620
intend for this to be used more by

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,030
senior level management as a

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,070
communication tool for privacy risk

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,200
management to really bring those privacy

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,270
discussions into parity with other

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,100
topics that are addressed as part of an

25
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,800
enterprise risk management program but

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,510
then we also introduce outcomes and

27
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,699
activities in the core an increasingly

28
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,070
granular level so that other roles like

29
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,140
engineers and lawyers and business teams

30
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,000
can work on celeb selecting and

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,860
implementing those outcomes and

32
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
activities so we're currently an ongoing

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,909
discussion with our stakeholders about

34
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,130
which aspects of the privacy framework

35
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,990
are most relevant to different roles and

36
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,520
what sort of digital guidance

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,290
organizations would like to see a

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,299
wrap-around roles in implementing the

39
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,930
privacy framework
