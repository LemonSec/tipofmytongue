2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,580
what is your organization's plan for

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,750
managing privacy and is that plan

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,780
eroding or contributing to your

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,059
organization's success in this short

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,650
video series you're going to hear from

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,590
global privacy leaders as they talk

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,340
about the imperative of privacy we'll

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,170
start with how to frame the issue and

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,510
then move on to how your organization

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,090
can be thinking about managing this

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,668
complex challenge the challenge with

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,110
privacy this this word is so loaded and

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,200
and it carries meanings to people well

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,980
beyond just the commercial aspect of it

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,690
or the business aspect of it this is a

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,110
very human issue it is not like

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,629
antitrust or corporate law where

19
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,610
people's individual emotions and

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,920
feelings don't tend to get in the way of

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,260
what the law should be this is a

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,219
something that people are very

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,199
passionate about and it is very driven

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,870
by culture you want to make sure that

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,500
you've got an understanding and a buy-in

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,680
from the leadership of your organization

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,850
however small however big and that they

28
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,799
put out the message that privacy is an

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,530
important value to the company here at

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,170
the ia pp we've worked with a fortune

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,990
100 financial services company that

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,810
really dedicates executive attention to

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,270
their training program so much so that

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,820
they have a c-level executive introduce

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,790
every privacy training class so that

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,520
employees understand the value that the

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,210
corporation places on privacy now if you

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,229
saying that you care about personal

39
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,720
information the data of your consumers

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,729
of your customers of your employees by

41
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,680
equation BEC is how does that compare to

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
how you treat money in your organization

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,149
and I think that in many cases you find

44
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,590
that there is a big gap between how we

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,649
control funds and how we control this

46
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,840
thing that we say we so care about make

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,909
no mistake

48
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,100
privacy is a valuable asset of your

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,350
organization now I know that your

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,500
organization values many things research

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,030
and development into

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,209
to property customers you need to add

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,080
privacy to that list I was a CEO I would

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,750
want to leverage my information my best

55
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,600
asset and how am I going to do that only

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,870
if I have privacy program that enables

57
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,120
me to use data if you're going to build

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,860
a culture within an organization that

59
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,000
respects the data that you are

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,590
collecting and using and making

61
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,230
decisions on you've got to start with

62
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,300
the ability to get everybody from the

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,920
beginning of your organization all the

64
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,600
way through mature companies to be

65
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,489
thinking about the issue of privacy and

66
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,930
see it as something that they own a

67
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,130
piece of and that they have

68
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,410
responsibility for not just the control

69
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,350
functions compliance of legal department

70
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,840
audit but the business functions as well

71
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,370
as the board and senior management

72
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,890
there's really no question that privacy

73
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,650
is a bottom-line issue for organizations

74
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,170
today there's an upside potential

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,290
certainly the better customer engagement

76
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,480
trust and stickiness for your products

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,060
and services you also have to be aware

78
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,269
of the downside loss of customer

79
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,430
engagement regulatory fines the

80
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,120
consequences of breach there's just no

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,989
getting around it privacy matters one of

82
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,579
the things that we're all going to have

83
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,329
to start doing is getting everybody on

84
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,120
the same page in a company to understand

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,820
how we handle data ties in with our

86
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,450
corporate values our ethics how we want

87
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,340
to approach this issue as an

88
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,800
organization both publicly and in

89
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,380
this is the moment for privacy moves

90
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,720
from back room to the boardroom and has

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
to absolutely be on everybody's mind and

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,190
if reading the business section of any

93
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,710
newspaper today doesn't tell you that

94
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,780
privacy is important then maybe nothing

95
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,090
else will but let me put it in terms

96
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,820
that most CEOs will probably like and

97
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,260
that is that privacy is not just a risk

98
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,590
privacy is not just a cost center

99
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,610
privacy is an opportunity

100
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,030
you
