we'll share a lot of news about what's

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,809

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,409
to engage going forward one of the

27
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,110
things that is clearly the case is that

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,320
the field of privacy is exploding around

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,250
the world today the ia PP has 25,000

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,729
members in 80 countries across our

31
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,770
membership we know from surveying our

32
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,560
members that over 40 percent of our

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,009
members are lawyers a bigger number than

34
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,630
that forty percent actually come from

35
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,030
law related professions more broadly and

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,259
those lawyers need services they need to

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,430
meet to engage to learn about privacy as

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,460
a legal topic and after some leadership

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,590
and prompting from Chris wolf in the

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,680
future of privacy forum which Chris

serves as the president of the of the

42
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,030

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,790

49
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,250
things off to Chris to talk a little bit

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
about why this is important and why the

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,200
moment is important for us to be

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,030
launching this new initiative Chris

53
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,700
Trevor Trevor thank you very much and

54
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,590
this truly is an exciting announcement I

55
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,769
think I thank the IPP for embracing the

56
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,440
idea and really running with it you know

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,280
36 years ago when I became a lawyer

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,440
privacy law meant basically the mall the

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
Fourth Amendment the underused processer

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,489
privacy towards the Privacy Act of 1974

61
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,459
and and not much else and you fast

62
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,790
forward to today and there are hundreds

63
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,799
of privacy and data security laws we

64
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,250
have the common law of FTC consent

65
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,280
decrees we have thousands of lawyers

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,319
across America who are practicing

67
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,049
privacy law as a distinct area of

68
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,599
practice as well as privacy academics

69
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,489
who are teaching privacy law in our law

70
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,260
schools with the advent of the Internet

71
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,540
as a principal means of communication

72
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,700
and commerce with electronic health

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,980
records with online banking with

74
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,920
educational privacy with the Internet of

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,459
Things with big data and I could go on

76
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,250
privacy law has become a specialty with

77
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,329
burgeoning subspecialties businesses

78
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,010
today are embracing privacy by design

79
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,560
and as they do that they know that

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,290
privacy law compliance is an integral

81
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,209
part of their planning and of doing

82
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,980
business and they realize that privacy

83
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,280
lawyers are indispensable and that

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,989
turning to generalist lawyers for

85
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,639
privacy law just doesn't cut it anymore

86
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,359
so at the same time individuals are

87
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,760
realizing that privacy law provides many

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,130
remedies and tools to vindicate their

89
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,739
rights and governments know that privacy

90
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,299
laws give citizens rights and that

91
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,549
privacy lawyers are needed in government

92
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,290
organizations to guarantee those rights

93
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,040
so in short or in some privacy law is

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,500
vitally important to society and its

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,720
importance is growing and so privacy law

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,470
as a separate discipline is here to stay

97
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,670
just as when antitrust law and

98
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,620
communications law emerged the separate

99
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,000
disciplines and developed their own

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,419
separate professional forums the time

101
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,450
has come as PP is recognized for privacy

102
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,210
lawyers to have their own separate

103
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,280
professional forum and I'm delighted

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,990
that IPP with the support and

105
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,550
cooperation of the future of privacy

106
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,960
forum is creating such a professional

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
privacy lawyers including practitioners

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,730
and law professors at judges now will

109
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,650
have their own place to contaminant

110
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,480
estas legal issues and legal

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,800
developments when the Supreme Court

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,620
issues a decision on privacy law when a

113
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,750
court of appeals issues a decision on

114
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,850
the scope and jurisdiction federal

115
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,100
enforcement when Congress considers

116
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,020
amendments to update existing privacy

117
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,410
laws contemplates new privacy law

118
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,410
remedies this new ia PP professional

119
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,229
forum for privacy lawyers will be the

120
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,970
place where the details of those

121
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,220
developments are discussed in depth

122
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,440
it'll be a place for providing

123
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,169
opportunities for legal scholarship

124
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,760
it'll be a place where privacy lawyers

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,010
can consider professional issues unique

126
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,650
to our discipline and I think the

127
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,690
potential for this new division is just

128
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,880
terrific you look at the Federal

129
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,100
Communications Bar Association as an

130
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,070
example of a robust organization

131
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,020
dedicated to specific to a specific

132
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,570
legal discipline and I think this new ia

133
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,000
PP lawyers division as the similar

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,039
similar potential to be a wonderful

135
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,840
professional home for those of us who

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,600
are lucky enough to practice privacy

137
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,840
laws so I encourage my fellow privacy

138
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,050
lawyers and privacy law professors and

139
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,620
those in the judiciary to engage in this

140
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,650
terrific new initiative you know just as

141
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,900
the ITP has provided amazing

142
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,020
opportunities for professional growth

143
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,030
for privacy professionals generally

144
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,610
lawyers and non-lawyers alike I think

145
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,250
this new focused division promises great

146
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,590
opportunities and it can only truly

147
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,720
succeed with critical mass so I

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,900
encourage everyone on this call to

149
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,180
engage and with that I will turn it back

150
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,020
to Trevor to explain how that will work

151

in the morning through lunch to allow

170
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,620
people to get back home on Thursday

171
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,099
afternoon after the summit so stay tuned

172
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,930
for that announcement watch for that

173
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,500
program and that event which will be the

174
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,690
inaugural event for the privacy bar

175
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,819
section we expect that program as Chris

176
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,639
mentioned to be heavily focused on the

177
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,039
needs of lawyers practicing in the field

178
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,620
of privacy and it will be an opportunity

179
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,009
for us to dive deeper to explore more

180
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,770
thoroughly many of the issues that

181
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,590
privacy lawyers are are encountering

182
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,279
today we are also launching an advisory

183
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,560
board this is an advisory board that

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,560
will advise is the IEP P on the needs of

185
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,039
the privacy bar sections will help us to

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,069
program content in the months and years

187
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,159
ahead and will also help to oversee the

188
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,229
development of the section with many

189
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,979
future services and and deliverables to

190
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,078
the to the privacy bar so I am today we

191
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:43,589
are today announcing that we are seeking

192
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,730
nominations for that Advisory Board the

193
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,190
ITP has many advisory boards that help

194
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,460
us

195
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,200
with many of the functions within the I

196
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,080
ATP this advisory board will serve in a

197
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,170
similar posture as I mentioned

198
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,590
previously Chris as really the the

199
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,530
person who led this effort and brought

200
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,710
it to the IEP P will be the inaugural

201
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,990
chair of this advisory board but we are

202
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,650
seeking 10 to 12 additional leaders to

203
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,660
help us guide the privacy bar session

204
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,580
you should see on the screen in front of

205
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,930
you a link to the nomination process and

206
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,850
just one note about that link

207
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,120
well that page is up right now we don't

208
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,190
have the field capture mechanism totally

209
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,590
locked down so if you are interested in

210
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,500
nominating I'd ask you to defer till the

211
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,730
end of the day today or first thing

212
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,410
tomorrow morning to nominate yourself

213
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,560
but that link is the place that you can

214
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,410
nominate understand that we will likely

215
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,440
get more interest than we probably have

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,650
capacity to support right now we think

217
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,510
that it's important for us to start

218
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,680
small and grow we will select people to

219
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,140
serve on this advisory board IEP staff

220
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,030
will select people to serve on this

221
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,530
advisory board based on a diversity of

222
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,610
representation we certainly want to have

223
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,940
outside counsel in-house counsel privacy

224
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,400
academics we want to have a broad range

225
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,280
of practitioners in the field of privacy

226
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,270
law represented on this advisory board

227
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,700
in the future though we expect that many

228
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,220
leadership opportunities will emerge for

229
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,620
many many people in the privacy bar

230
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,820
section so bear with us as we let this

231
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,980
this idea grow from from this this

232
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,010
rather humble beginning we expect lots

233
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,290
of great things to happen but we want

234
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,360
them to build on success after success

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,880
and it will take us some time to get all

236
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,550
of those things up to speed I do have

237
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,020
some other exciting news to share and I

238
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,750
want everyone to understand that this is

239
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,240
not completely locked down yet however

240
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,410
last week the IEP is submitted and

241
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,470
location to the American Bar Association

242
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,170
for recognition of our credentials for

243
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,019
the purpose of recognizing

244
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,670
specialization in the field of privacy

245
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,339
law this is important for lawyers across

246
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:19,009
the country because ABA recognition

247
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,040
carries reciprocity with a number of

248
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,529
states around the country and for

249
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,100
purposes of distinguishing or

250
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,209
demonstrating that you have a specialty

251
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,810
in a particular field you can think of

252
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,060
patent law or family law or other areas

253
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,540
of specialty in in in the privacy world

254
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,689
the ABA recognizes well-established and

255
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:47,420
credible certification programs for the

256
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,670
purposes of demonstrating that specialty

257
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,449
in the marketplace we submitted our

258
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:56,389
application last week as all of you

259
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,000
should know last year the IEP was

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
successful in receiving ISO

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,089
accreditation through ANSI for many of

262
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,959
our certification programs and that is

263
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,459
significantly influential in this ABA

264
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,579
process and we are hoping that at some

265
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,439
point this year we will be able to share

266
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,610
the great news with all of you that IEP

267
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,130
certifications are a path to

268
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,810
demonstrating to the marketplace

269
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,329
recognized by the ABA and therefore

270
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,550
recognized by many of the licensing

271
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,230
states that you are licensed in that it

272
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,060
is a mechanism to demonstrate to the

273
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,670
marketplace that you are specialized in

274
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,459
the field of privacy law we'll have more

275
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,639
news on that as developments occur as we

276
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,490
hear back from the ABA I can also share

277
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,860
with you that South Carolina

278
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,389
independently recognized our CI PP

279
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,579
designation for exactly this purpose

280
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:55,459
that lawyers in South Carolina who

281
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,889
carried a CI PP designation have the

282
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,079
ability to reference that designation as

283
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,089
an indicator of their specialization in

284
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,029
the field of information privacy all of

285
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,589
this is to suggest that Chris is

286
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,839
leadership and really provocation to the

287
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,649
IPP that we move forward with this idea

288
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,480
was very

289
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,519
very timely the American Bar Association

290
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,220
was very receptive to our application

291
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,490
because the moment is right to recognize

292
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,889
that those forty percent of our members

293
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,470
those many thousands of privacy lawyers

294
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,480
across the United States are doing

295
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,190
something unique doing something

296
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,470
different and doing something incredibly

297
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,529
important to today it's digital economy

298
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,070
and so we're very very happy about

299
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,420
today's announcement and we certainly

300
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,920
look forward to great things in the

301
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,930
future I do want to talk about the

302
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,690
future just a little bit in the future

303
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,490
we expect that the privacy bar section

304
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,079
will do many of the things that you

305
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,480
would expect a section of the ITP

306
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,360
focused on the privacy bar would do you

307
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,610
can expect unique content you can expect

308
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,339
unique events web conferences and other

309
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,800
things again we ask that you bear with

310
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,320
us as we allow this to grow organically

311
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,870
if you will we want this to grow slowly

312
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,560
based on success after success but we

313
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,050
are investing resources in supporting

314
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,810
this new section and and developing it

315
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,230
we will have lots more announcements in

316
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,170
the days and weeks ahead certainly stay

317
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,199
tuned for and watch for the announcement

318
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,899
of the event running immediately after

319
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,050
the global privacy summit and I think

320
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,260
for many of you how great would it be to

321
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,209
be able to say that you were there for

322
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:43,209
the very first event that created the

323
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,579
privacy bar section within the ia PP

324
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,430
that is a foundational moment for the

325
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,010
privacy bar and I think many decades

326
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,660
from now will look back at that moment

327
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,389
and say that's when it really started so

328
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,490
I hope that you'll be there with us but

329
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,980
watch also for other announcements from

330
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,470
the privacy bar section we certainly

331
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,300
have many great plans and you know that

332
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,920
many of you will have great ideas that

333
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,069
will help us guide this idea in the

334
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:12,010
future so there it is a big announcement
