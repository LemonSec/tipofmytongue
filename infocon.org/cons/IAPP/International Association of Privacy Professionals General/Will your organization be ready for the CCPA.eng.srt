1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,720
companies that have worked on compliance

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,920
with the general data protection

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,000
regulation of the European Union are

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,950
definitely better prepared to comply

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,809
with the California consumer privacy act

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,630
in companies who have not I feel sorry

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,570
for those of my clients who have a

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,509
domestic focus and who were spared by

9
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:26,660
the GDP are only to now find that they

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,960
have this much more rigid prescriptive

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,560
and intrusive law to comply with which

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,650
may come particularly if we get a right

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,810
of private action which much more harsh

14
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,580
enforcement and so I would say to all

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,560
the companies that have done a good job

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,270
on GDP our compliance you're in good

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,010
shape you're in better shape you're

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,890
ahead but they still work to be done
