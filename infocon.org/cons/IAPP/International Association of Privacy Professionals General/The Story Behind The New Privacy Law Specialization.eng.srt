00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm here in the Weston library at the iapp

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,679
And I'm delighted to be talking to you about something important and new that we have just launched at the iapp

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,279
this library was donated to us by Allen Westen Allen is one of the forefathers of our field and

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,899
When he passed away a few years ago. He donated his professional library to us now all of you should know Allen's name in

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,720
1967 he wrote this book

6
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:44,149
Privacy and freedom and in 1967 privacy and freedom was really one of the first times that an academic a legal scholar

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,430
Had articulated the idea that there was a privacy interest held within our data

8
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,919
Well in the 50 years since privacy and freedom was written by Alan Weston a lot has changed

9
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,819
And we've seen some tremendous growth in the privacy field

10
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,830
Significantly we now have hundreds if not thousands of lawyers working in this field across the United States in

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,489
recognition of that growth and also in recognition of the need for

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,419
advanced and more evolved solutions for those professionals

13
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,190
the iapp worked through the ABA accreditation process

14
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:25,720
And we are really delighted to announce that we have now achieved accreditation of a privacy law

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,860
specialization for lawyers and most states in the United States you'll find a lot more information about that program here on our website

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,620
And I encourage you to help us continue to move the privacy bar forward by exploring this new

17
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,780
specialization and

18
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,470
Following in Alan Weston's footsteps and helping us to build the privacy bar in the US
