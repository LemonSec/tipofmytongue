00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,890
share as I just shared with you in

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,810
person that I grabbed my copy of

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,140
inheritance this morning having just got

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,689
back from a week away where my mom was

26
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,479
helping out with my kids and I I found

27
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,070
this note tucked inside that I just

28
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,630
thought was so telling so had to share

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,159
it it just says loved it thank you mom

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,220
so just an awesome book

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,890
so before we kick off our discussion I

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,689
just wanted to ask for your help setting

33
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,990
the stage with regard to the book as you

34
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,969
know as we've you've talked to our

35
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,700
audience the IEP p membership is largely

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,219
made up of privacy professionals who are

37
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,560
tuning into our conversation working in

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,619
all areas of privacy for those who have

39
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,090
not yet had the pleasure of reading your

40
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,070
book can you help us set the stage give

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,950
us the elevator pitch what this is all

42
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,299
about what brings you here yeah

43
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,100
absolutely and and and before I do that

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,219
let me just say that inheritance in

45
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,869
hardcover was published a year ago

46
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:09,729
it comes out tomorrow in paperback which

47
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,340
is why I'm back on the road on tour but

48
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,239
in this year I've been on tour pretty

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
much full stop all the time

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,070
more than a hundred events and I've

51
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,540
noticed over the course of this year

52
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,260
that increasingly some of the questions

53
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,380
during the Q&A sessions more and more

54
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,300
have to do with privacy questions about

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,880
privacy so elevator pitch in the winter

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,410
of 2016

57
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,260
my husband was sending away for a DNA

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,040
kit as I think of it recreationally just

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,820
for fun to see maybe if there were some

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,050
distant relatives that he didn't know

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,410
about so that he'd be able to speak to

62
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,300
his elderly dad about that kind of thing

63
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,490
and he asked me if I wanted to do it too

64
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,400
and I had absolutely no interest I

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,990
wasn't curious I knew where I came from

66
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,330
I knew everything about my family that

67
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,120
there was to know but something made me

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,240
sort of just shrug and say sure as I'm

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,690
sure you all know these companies lower

70
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,010
their prices right before the holidays

71
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,800
make it very appealing make it be like

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,850
no big deal it's just fun and so a

73
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,620
couple of months later when my results

74
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,980
were returned in short order they

75
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,130
revealed to me that my dad who had

76
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,570
passed away when I was young and who I

77
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,880
had been very close to had not been my

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,700
biological father and that led me

79
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,290
without giving everything away but down

80
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,180
this rabbit hole into a big part of the

81
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,280
world that I think that interests

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,290
privacy professionals resides which is

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,010
that I came to discover that my parents

84
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,610
had had fertility issues that they had

85
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,310
gone to an institute that used donor

86
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,440
sperm anonymous donors and that my

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,709
biological father was an anonymous sperm

88
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,900
donor who I found within 36 hours of

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,160
discovering that my dad had not been my

90
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,589
biological father and that has plunged

91
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,950
me since then into this world of

92
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,510
questions and bioethics and all of the

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,740
issues I'm sure some of which we're

94
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,040
going to talk about

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,990
in terms of what is our responsibility

96
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,080
to each other in this world where

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,800
science has changed all everything all

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,630
the rules I was going to say but the

99
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,960
rules are changing because of these

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,620
unintended consequences of this

101
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,280
combination I think of the the one-two

102
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,980
punch of easy accessible inexpensive DNA

103
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,660
testing that has become the number one

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,900
holiday gift in America and the internet

105
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,630
which makes everything figure out a bowl

106
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,580
and discoverable thank you so much I

107
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,280
think for for privacy professionals your

108
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,470
your writing in this topic is so

109
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,010
intriguing in part because it's so

110
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,960
personal right you make these issues

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
that sometimes are the subject of

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,970
lengthy privacy notices so real and so

113
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,639
personal so yes let's let's talk about

114
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,520
some of those issues so in in your book

115
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,540
you write about privacy in and sometimes

116
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,400
you even you know touch specifically on

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,680
that more often I think you spoke of

118
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,650
secrets and surprise and so every time

119
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,320
you said the word surprise it made me

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,650
think about expectations and I think in

121
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,250
the the privacy world we think about

122
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,860
meeting her setting user expectations

123
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,539
and how to avoid shocking surprises so

124
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,240
you know when you did this you speak of

125
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,510
it as a bit of a whim but presumably

126
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,960
there were some kind of Terms of Service

127
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,410
I would love to hear your thoughts on

128
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,039
how prepared you felt for the

129
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,020
information that you were given about

130
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,680
your own genetics and if you had any

131
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,530
concerns about how your data you know

132
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,880
might be used without you knowing well

133
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,240
to start with I am certain I mean I know

134
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,180
for a fact that there are these terms of

135
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,440
use you know very tiny or at least that

136
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,270
as I recall you know you check the box

137
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,270
you can barely even see what you're what

138
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,680
you're signing away or what

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,630
you're you know either what rights are

140
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,949
you signing away or what you might be

141
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,350
letting yourself in for the marketing of

142
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,900
of these particular companies DNA

143
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,639
testing companies is really all about

144
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,520
you know ancestry.com it's Kelly Ripa

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,050
waving the Italian flag saying I just

146
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,669
found out I'm one-eighth Italian it's

147
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,240
all all good fun it's all you know fun

148
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,900
facts and very little is made of the

149
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,759
approximately two percent of people who

150
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,400
take these tests but in the way that I

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,130
did unsuspectingly and discover what in

152
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,440
that world is known as as an NP II which

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,389
stands for not parent expected so there

154
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,699
was no part of me that was prepared for

155
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:32,940
that

156
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,099
partly because I had no suspicion that

157
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,750
that was the case I think today people

158
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,580
are becoming a little bit more aware

159
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,979
partly because of my book and partly

160
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,570
because of a lot of news stories that

161
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,320
this is kind of epidemic with how many

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,460
people are discovering things about

163
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,740
their things that were not that they

164
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,419
that they hadn't signed on for that they

165
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,210
had no idea it's not always not parent

166
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,860
expected sometimes it's not child

167
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,070
expected sometimes it's not half

168
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,699
siblings expected it's lots of different

169
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,960
kinds of discoveries but they're all

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,550
they're all happening and in my

171
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,159
experience as the person who I think has

172
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,990
probably met more of these people than I

173
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,020
would say anyone because they all come

174
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,849
to my events and in my book tours there

175
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,750
is there is a sense of people aren't

176
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,800
taking these tests because they think

177
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,030
they're going to find out that kind of

178
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,409
thing they're taking these tests because

179
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,659
in the same way that I did for the most

180
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:33,328
part and making these discoveries in

181
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,828
terms of privacy I honestly didn't think

182
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,229
about it I think I would today four

183
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,529
years later because again it's much more

184
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:48,810
understood that how how many how many

185
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,880
doors and windows and pathways our DNA

186
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,730
leak can lead to and you know the

187
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,530
question of what happens to it

188
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,780
and and who can see it and what what's

189
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,270
that gonna mean and has that horse fled

190
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,800
the barn or is there still anything to

191
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,230
do about it I you're speaking that makes

192
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,820
me wonder if some of these issues are

193
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,960
too big to to prepare yourself for or if

194
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,600
I guess the question is do you think

195
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,270
there would have been a way or there is

196
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,330
a way to kind of prepare the users for

197
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,910
these types of surprises or privacy

198
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,310
issues I don't think anybody thinks that

199
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,110
it's going to be them yeah after I speak

200
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,940
now people either say I'm never taking

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,640
one of those tests or they immediately

202
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,430
order one of those tests or they reset

203
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,700
their privacy function in the tests that

204
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,740
they've already done

205
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,620
people have different responses based on

206
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,320
their own conscience I mean I've had I

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,960
have someone a friend of mine who said I

208
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,480
think that probably my father wasn't my

209
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,740
biological father and I'm never gonna

210
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,190
take one of those tests because it's a

211
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,440
family business you know the family has

212
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,560
a business and he would be terrified of

213
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,450
what would happen if it got out that

214
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,640
that was the case but for the most part

215
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,380
most of the people making these

216
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,470
discoveries aren't they're just I mean

217
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,020
in retrospect when I think of my story

218
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,080
it was in the light of retrospect very

219
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,150
clear that in all likelihood my father

220
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,640
wasn't my biological father but there's

221
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,970
a term that I that I came across in my

222
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,290
research as I was writing the book and

223
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,480
it's a psychoanalytic term and it's the

224
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,770
unthought known hmm what we know in our

225
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,050
bones in our sin you and our marrow in

226
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,450
our gut but we it's too dangerous to

227
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,390
think so we don't think it and I find

228
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,320
that such a powerful painful poetic

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,600
human you know I think we all have

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,040
elements of it and it's a question of

231
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,710
how much or how big and in my case the

232
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,980
unthought known I mean even as a writer

233
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,420
when I go back and I read my early work

234
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,700
you know when I was a 25 year old baby

235
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,540
writer

236
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,510
it's there in my work I knew but I

237
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,170
couldn't think it so when I went ahead

238
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,440
and said sure what's you know I'll spit

239
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,560
into the plastic vial it was with no

240
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,790
nothing in my body was saying oh and I

241
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,800
think that that's really true fur for

242
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,529
most people and which is why I don't

243
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,269
have the latest statistics about this at

244
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,760
my fingertips but I heard maybe six

245
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,589
months ago that ancestry know that that

246
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,300
23andme was fielding between four and

247
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,149
six thousand phone calls a week from

248
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:47,800
people saying like I don't understand my

249
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,199
results and they're training more people

250
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,839
to answer the phone lines and have a

251
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,339
little bit but but they're also really

252
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:00,310
trying to keep it really out of out of

253
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,720
the public sphere as much as they

254
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,620
possibly can the the CEO 23andme was

255
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,570
asked on a podcast I was on Freakonomics

256
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,089
if she had read my book and or heard of

257
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,010
my books and she said no and I know that

258
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,199
there's no way that's true Wow yeah

259
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,480
she's like what what are you speaking

260
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,440
this book you know and and actually as

261
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,579
far as I'm concerned it's kind of missed

262
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,620
a mistake on their part because I have a

263
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,290
good story it was a painful and shocking

264
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,389
story but it was a good story I loved my

265
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,060
dad I still you know he was he's my dad

266
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,519
you know and and I met my biological

267
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,459
father and he's a really good guy who's

268
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,920
not my dad but who I come from

269
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,470
everybody's been kind everybody's been

270
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,569
good everyone has embraced everybody

271
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:49,569
else it doesn't get better than this

272
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm so like if you're gonna if you were

273
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,709
ever gonna say this is the kind of thing

274
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,480
that can happen as an unintended

275
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,360
consequence I'm a good story I hear so

276
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,959
many bad stories painful stories so I

277
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,350
want to turn to to your dad you know

278
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,300
it's helpful to understand how you think

279
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,240
about you know your privacy and your own

280
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,269
genetics but kind of turning to him and

281
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:16,420
I you speak to this in the book you

282
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,519
speak about your search for him

283
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,190
and your outreach to him oh you need my

284
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,990
biological I'm sorry that's okay your

285
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,069
biological father

286
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,100
so can you can you share with us

287
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,170
how you think about your biological

288
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,590
father's privacy you know either where

289
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,450
you began with that or where you ended

290
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,620
up with this let's start with where I

291
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:45,070
began okay when I first discovered my

292
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,800
biological father which took very few

293
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,670
keystrokes and a hunch and educated

294
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,470
guess I first saw him on a YouTube video

295
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,060
giving a lecture and it was unmistakable

296
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,900
that he was my biological father he I

297
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,570
mean he gestured the way I'm gesturing

298
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:16,510
right now within hours I had written to

299
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,780
him but and I don't know how I knew to

300
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,930
do this but I was able to put myself in

301
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,750
his shoes I have heard stories since

302
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,840
then of people who make this discovery

303
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,640
and in their shock or their sense of

304
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,430
betrayal or their rages I'll send a

305
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,600
registered letter or hmm a half a dozen

306
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,160
newly discovered half siblings will

307
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,030
write a letter together or and and you

308
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,980
know not thinking about what it's gonna

309
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,050
be to be this elderly person on the

310
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,570
other end of that who's opening his

311
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,940
email and thinking that he's gonna you

312
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,590
know have his golf club

313
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,310
you know dues to pay and you know some

314
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,870
political contributions to make and

315
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,700
instead there's an email saying I think

316
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,220
maybe you're my biological father I was

317
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,350
very aware of how shocking that might be

318
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,340
and so I wrote a very careful letter and

319
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,710
I may even I don't know that I use

320
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,870
privacy as a word in that first letter

321
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,270
but it came up very quickly between us

322
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:21,100
when we started exchanging emails I was

323
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,480
aware that this could potentially be uh

324
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,100
pending somebody's life as it turns out

325
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,010
and when he wrote back to me the first

326
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,830
time which I also was very conscious

327
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,030
that he didn't have to do

328
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,360
he could have ghosted me he

329
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,089
could have gasps let me he could have

330
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,320
said I have no idea what you're talking

331
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,140
about I was never a sperm donor you're

332
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,910
out of your mind

333
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,850
please don't contact me again he could

334
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,290
have done what one young woman came up

335
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,140
to me at an event and said she found her

336
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,760
biological father and she got two words

337
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,690
back from him not interested right so I

338
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,540
was aware that he was kind in his in

339
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,700
replying to me at all and in making it

340
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,279
clear that I wasn't barking up the wrong

341
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:12,790
tree

342
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,170
he spoke of living a quiet life with his

343
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,760
family his children and grandchildren

344
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,220
living nearby living in a retirement

345
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,399
community I mean if you parsed what he

346
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,019
was saying it really was leave us alone

347
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,950
or don't don't just don't intrude

348
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,310
don't upend my really lovely life that

349
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,019
I've built for myself over all of these

350
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:42,990
years as we see also looked me up and

351
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,760
the good news because I've seen many

352
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,540
people in the situation donors or other

353
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,779
members of a family who are contacted by

354
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,180
someone who has discovered that they are

355
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,699
related and universally the response of

356
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:04,449
the family is if you'll threatened

357
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:07,329
I think it's hardwired I think it's it's

358
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,559
a primitive primal kind of what do you

359
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,150
want and it's usually you you're looking

360
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,250
for money it kind of just goes straight

361
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,750
to the financial because I think that's

362
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,020
where people feel most easily like feel

363
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,760
it most easily while normal vulnerable

364
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,329
and and i think i intuited all that but

365
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,679
so when he went on my website i think he

366
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,200
saw that i was had a successful career

367
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,940
and a contented life and you could glean

368
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,520
a lot from my website but it also showed

369
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,590
that I was a writer mm-hmm it showed a

370
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,390
picture at that time on the homepage of

371
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,429
my website of Oprah with her arm around

372
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,950
me you know which is like good news and

373
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,470
bad news in the situation and I think he

374
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,300
was terrified that he was going to be

375
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,770
somehow revealed and so as

376
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,920
we progressed another reason why I say

377
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,630
that our story is such a good story is

378
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,730
that I think everyone tried to do the

379
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,310
right thing by each other I really

380
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,320
wanted to respect his privacy I also

381
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,560
really wanted to write a book and I had

382
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,600
to find a way to not to not make but

383
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,740
those two things you know mutually

384
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,350
exclusive or impossible or in conflict

385
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,960
with each other and so I took great

386
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,390
pains while I was researching reporting

387
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,540
writing inheritance to protect his

388
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,130
privacy it wasn't just changing his

389
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,410
names there are a lot of details in the

390
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,730
book minor details that changed his

391
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,380
identity enough that I didn't want

392
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,680
anyone who knew him to be able to read

393
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,880
the book and say that sounds an awful

394
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,160
lot like Ben Walden I didn't you know

395
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,260
like I didn't want that to me at that

396
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,060
level like gosh I wonder if that could

397
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,570
be Ben Walden I then when I finished the

398
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,930
book sent it to him for his input I

399
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,300
wanted him to feel that his privacy was

400
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,940
protected and as a memoirist it is like

401
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,460
memoirist 101 that you do not send a

402
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,330
manuscript

403
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,070
to people that you've written about it's

404
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,420
like sending them like a hunk of wet

405
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,950
clay and going here like would you like

406
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,490
to reshape this but I got his blessing

407
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,900
and he did feel like his privacy was

408
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,480
protected but in terms of how am I

409
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,690
thinking about this has evolved we're

410
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,510
living in this time that no one could

411
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,140
have imagined the promises I don't have

412
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,590
a lot of patience for the promises of

413
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,830
anonymity that were given to people at a

414
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,690
time when the idea that there could be

415
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,520
these kinds of discoveries would have

416
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,590
been the stuff of science fiction it was

417
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,320
never gonna happen right and when I

418
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,110
encounter people who get I mean I was at

419
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,640
dinner just the other night with a woman

420
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,260
who just folded her arms and she said I

421
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,480
know two families who have been ruined

422
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,610
by being contacted by by doing her

423
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,560
offspring and I just I just know I just

424
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,840
don't believe in that she also said to

425
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,130
me and your father still your father

426
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,590
like thank you it have you walked for a

427
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,760
second in my shoes just wondering

428
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,840
and I do believe I do feel that the

429
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,130
father who raised me is still my father

430
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,470
but I had to get there right it wasn't

431
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,680
it wasn't like that

432
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,390
regarding the contact I what I said to

433
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,260
her was the children who or the grown

434
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,550
children who discover this they didn't

435
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,220
ask to be conceived this way they didn't

436
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,930
ask to live a life where their

437
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,980
identities were hidden from them where

438
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,570
they were giving incorrect medical

439
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,120
information for their whole lives where

440
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,400
there was something about them that

441
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,110
didn't add up and it didn't make sense

442
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,380
and that just felt like something isn't

443
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,950
quite right and then they didn't ask to

444
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,440
make a sort of seismic world rocking

445
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,270
discovery when it comes to identity at

446
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,940
some point well into their lives they

447
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,640
didn't ask for any of that and so

448
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,390
they're walking around kind of reeling

449
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,830
donors I mean I see this at my events

450
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,320
all the time now I from the first night

451
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,650
I saw it not when I speak it's something

452
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,210
like the I AP people and I'm just I'm

453
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,070
doing in November people are coming from

454
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,230
all over the place I would see elderly

455
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,970
men and I would think firm donors and

456
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,410
then I would see all of these other

457
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,870
people who looked literally like they

458
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,810
were radiating like hunger and intensity

459
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,150
and pain and I was like you just found

460
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,340
out and then there would be couples

461
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,440
sitting there looking kind of stricken

462
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,640
and I found out very often that they

463
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,220
were parents who had never disclosed to

464
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,830
their children who were trying to figure

465
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,180
out and this is heartbreaking to me but

466
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,790
this is happening all the time now

467
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,810
they're realizing that their children

468
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,960
are going to find out and they always

469
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,580
plan to go to the grave with a secret

470
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,110
are they going to do that or are they

471
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,880
going to do what I would think of as the

472
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,950
last great act of parenting that they

473
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,650
can do and have an incredibly painful

474
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,170
difficult reckoning with their kids but

475
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,260
tell them the truth so I'm getting a

476
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,880
little off the subject privacy here but

477
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,060
it feels to me like the rules that would

478
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,720
seem simple don't necessarily apply

479
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,580
there's a lot of gray area and there's a

480
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,140
lot of

481
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,840
I mean I have a relationship with my

482
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,820
biological father I respected his

483
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,250
privacy he's been very kind to me we

484
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,140
like each other what if I had been one

485
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,769
of forty-seven I guarantee you we

486
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,419
wouldn't have this relationship what

487
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,149
does it mean - and that happens all the

488
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,419
time

489
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,610
yeah it's happening constantly I

490
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,340
actually didn't you say these aren't

491
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,470
privacy issues necessarily but actually

492
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,029
where I wanted to go with this

493
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:47,460
conversation is touching on many of the

494
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,409
things that that you've now raised and

495
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,049
the different groups that you have

496
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,570
outlined you know as as being there and

497
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,019
how you think about the impact and and

498
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,820
the privacy implications for each of

499
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,090
them so you know you touched on on sperm

500
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,630
donors and you touched on adoptions you

501
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,460
know I think obviously the prevailing

502
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,440
wisdom 50 years ago was that anonymity

503
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,960
was possible and it was possible with

504
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,909
sperm donation it was possible with

505
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:17,490
adoption it was possible with affairs

506
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,870
and so I you know you wrote in your book

507
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,510
at some point I think someone told you

508
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,820
or said to you you know there are no

509
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,320
more secrets and I'd love to get your

510
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,049
thoughts you know if you have any kind

511
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,510
of further thoughts on that issue and

512
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,380
and how that changes the nature of

513
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,039
privacy in society you know have we lost

514
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,090
something

515
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,539
if choices made sometimes at a very

516
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,809
young age cannot be forgotten you know

517
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,970
and the reinvention that maybe was

518
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,399
possible when they could be is not

519
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:58,980
possible today and strains a little from

520
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,279
privacy but for the Idol it's so complex

521
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,330
right because in the case of sperm

522
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,510
donation or egg donation I had an

523
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,580
interesting conversation at Harvard not

524
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,200
that long ago where one of the

525
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
bioethicists was saying that that they

526
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,029
don't feel that the that the donor has

527
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,309
any responsibility at all to offspring

528
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:22,559
any I mean every responsibility to be in

529
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,450
contact responsibility to say I see you

530
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,399
you exist responsibility to supply

531
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,889
medical information and I said you know

532
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:31,049
that's so interesting so here's another

533
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:32,430
scenario um

534
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,170
a couple a man and a woman have a

535
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,220
one-night stand they don't know each

536
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,260
other they're strangers yeah they have

537
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,530
sex she goes off she's pregnant she has

538
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,800
the child it's 25 years later and that

539
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,020
child contacts that man finds him

540
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,330
through DNA does that man have any

541
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,400
responsibility to that child and this

542
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,770
bioethics student said yes I think he

543
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,480
does I said well that's really

544
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,190
interesting because he was not trying to

545
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,580
procreate that night in the back of that

546
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,840
car or whatever donors are right they're

547
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,610
not trying to have their own offspring

548
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,250
but they are aware that if all things go

549
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,590
well that is in fact what they are doing

550
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,560
what they're being paid to do so it's

551
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,120
interesting to sort of separate out

552
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,670
completely the idea of I mean I think

553
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,720
our thinking has evolved and has

554
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,660
continued to evolve I mean it wasn't

555
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,380
just that anonymity was possible back

556
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,350
then it was that it was desirable it was

557
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,560
that it was considered for the good of

558
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,780
the child the idea that what we don't

559
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,720
know doesn't hurt us was prevalent so so

560
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,220
there all of these different kinds of

561
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,130
questions and issues there's something

562
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,360
further I wanted to say about that what

563
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,330
was it

564
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:00,780
it had to do with like the the now you

565
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,730
you all probably know this but both

566
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,650
France and I think Spain have I know

567
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,040
France just voted like this week that

568
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,490
there be no more anonymity in in in in

569
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,540
donation that anonymous donation is now

570
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:27,570
not legal we're now at a time where it

571
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,100
would seem to me and one of the reasons

572
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,880
why I continue to want to talk about all

573
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,150
this is where you have I mean there's

574
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,460
there's the question of there's the

575
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,220
question of privacy but we proceed the

576
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,580
question of privacy with the question of

577
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,900
secrecy and non-disclosed

578
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,440
so let's take a situation in which

579
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,059
everybody does to what my mind is the

580
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,760
right thing which most families today

581
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,730
are doing not all there are still people

582
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,100
coming up to me regularly saying my my

583
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,460
teenage son doesn't know or I just had a

584
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,790
baby using a donor egg and but you know

585
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,440
I gave birth so what difference does it

586
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,420
make like lots of stuff like that it's

587
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,370
like all I say is they're gonna find out

588
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,470
they're gonna find out right gonna find

589
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,730
out that's all I can say I don't want it

590
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,920
like ascribe any moral anything to it

591
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,350
they're just they're gonna find out but

592
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,830
for the most part people are disclosing

593
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,770
and then I also have an awareness that

594
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,559
in some cases the donor becomes part of

595
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,429
the family system everybody knows there

596
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,470
is a sense in the larger extended family

597
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,090
that this is the way that this child was

598
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,960
conceived and so in those situations

599
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,490
that I'm talking about family systems

600
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,620
not like DNA to solve crimes and things

601
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,290
like that but in family systems then

602
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,370
that sort of starts to mitigate the

603
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,710
questions of privacy because everybody's

604
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,080
kind of on the same page about this the

605
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,650
I would say the intersection of privacy

606
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,740
and secrecy here is when some people

607
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,510
want to keep something a secret and then

608
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,490
they don't get to and because it's

609
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,309
because it's not private and I mean I

610
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,559
think we can pretty much safely say or I

611
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,210
can I think secrets are toxic I think

612
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,970
you know Carl Jung once said until you

613
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,710
make the unconscious conscious it will

614
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,570
direct your life and you will call it

615
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,480
fate I think we would like to be

616
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,590
conscious of the things that are

617
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,660
directing our life and not have it be

618
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,179
based on secrecy but privacy is

619
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,090
important and how do we live in this

620
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,800
time where there are secrets pouring out

621
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,400
and yet at the same time they they they

622
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,980
impact the privacy of individuals and

623
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,650
and so I think in part perhaps you've

624
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,320
answered this question but it would be

625
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,680
interesting to me to

626
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,770
understand if if transparency and

627
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,350
openness is your answer or not you know

628
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,840
your genes are perhaps the most intimate

629
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,790
thing about you but they can be inferred

630
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,530
as was the case with your biological

631
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,800
father even if you don't take these

632
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,170
tests you know as we begin to think

633
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,560
about giving people agency over their

634
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,130
own genetic data and their own their own

635
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,090
genes is openness and transparency

636
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,190
there's or is there something else we

637
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,580
can do to to provide that agency I would

638
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,930
love to think that there's something

639
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,610
else that we can do what would that be I

640
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:54,630
mean I but that's I do think that

641
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,100
openness and transparency is the first

642
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,480
step but it's probably not the last step

643
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,760
it's probably not the only step does

644
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,250
that make sense yeah yeah no and it's I

645
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,980
mean I feel like it's a issue that you

646
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,850
you raised

647
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,420
other issues beyond this realm whether

648
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,770
it's you know solving crimes or the like

649
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,300
your your data is out there pretty

650
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,810
publicly now and so I don't understand

651
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,580
that yeah and that's interesting too I

652
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,200
mean the number of educated educated

653
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,910
people who come up to me and say well

654
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,650
I'm never taking that test because I

655
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,090
don't want my information out there and

656
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,980
they don't understand that their

657
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,130
information is already out there their

658
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,960
third cousin took it that's right I find

659
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,670
but really I would say that in my

660
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,620
experience in my travels for the last

661
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,110
few years I'm for the last year that

662
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,410
feels like a few years that it's that

663
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,720
many many people are operating under

664
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,050
kind of miss miss miss apprehensions

665
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,300
misunderstanding about what that is so I

666
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,420
I guess kind of thinking back to the you

667
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,550
know maybe we can't we can't solve this

668
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,850
agency problem here but having lived

669
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,160
through this experience yourself now are

670
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,179
there any

671
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,320
tools or resources that you think would

672
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,739
have made your path easier that you

673
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:24,669
would like to see out there to help

674
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:26,950
other people in these situations yeah

675
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,169
and some of them I think are starting to

676
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:33,580
be developed but I would begin in I mean

677
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,099
in in in the world of DNA testing with

678
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:41,559
much greater transparency and support on

679
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,669
the part of the companies who are doing

680
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:45,669
that this this testing and an awareness

681
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:50,200
of the of these unintended consequences

682
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,669
and how many hundreds of thousands of

683
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:53,710
people are being affected by this and to

684
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,269
not be trying to sweep it under the road

685
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:59,710
to actually be I've yet to see any of

686
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,989
these companies do anything other than

687
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:05,999
try to kind of minimize that and

688
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,499
maximize all the other you know

689
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:10,179
marvelous and fun things that they're

690
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,739
doing that were you know important

691
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:14,589
medical data but also like you know

692
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:16,389
that's not how they market it it's all

693
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:22,210
fun facts yeah there are more people

694
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,879
going into sort of dual fields of

695
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:32,589
bioethics and and psychology because

696
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:37,450
there's just such a it's never the

697
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,679
effects of the secrecy both of late

698
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,979
discovery adoptees and and donor can see

699
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:47,440
if people have never been studied and

700
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,239
the reason they've never been studied is

701
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:52,119
because it was a secret so now there's

702
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,320
just starting to be a little bit of data

703
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,070
and and and and surveys and making a

704
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,669
discovery like this is initially a very

705
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:09,969
self alienating feeling like this person

706
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:13,119
who I thought I was I'm not made up of

707
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,960
who I thought I was it's very different

708
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,330
and I really like to make this

709
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,320
distinction it's very different from

710
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,749
growing up adopted and always knowing

711
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:26,930
yeah

712
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,180
because our identities are formed by the

713
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,410
stories that were told from the time

714
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,140
were very small and if and our

715
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,240
narratives are created out of what we're

716
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,520
told and our our identities are built

717
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,770
that way and if if someone is adopted

718
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,940
and they know they're adopted then they

719
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,250
know why they don't resemble their

720
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,210
biological their their their their

721
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,300
social parents they they they can

722
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,270
account for their feeling of other Ness

723
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:53,270
they can supply reasons for this

724
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,740
beautiful term that I write about an

725
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,780
inheritance genealogical bewilderment

726
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,180
there's like there's they know why

727
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,010
they're feeling what they're feeling but

728
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,860
the world of people whose identities are

729
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,270
withheld from them which includes some

730
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,940
adoptees fewer and fewer many donor

731
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,060
conceive people were they were they were

732
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,670
deceived you know there was a huge

733
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,560
omission and it's more than omission I

734
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,270
mean they were the stories that that

735
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,070
that we were told from the time we were

736
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,199
very small were simply not true so

737
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,489
you're building your identity around

738
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:29,830
something that's not solid and there are

739
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,880
literally hundreds of thousands of

740
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,949
people who who need some sort of help I

741
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,449
mean they're turning to my book I mean

742
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,469
that's the only help there is out there

743
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,409
it's people are reading inheritance and

744
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,409
parents are telling their children or or

745
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,199
you know the the donor can see people

746
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,900
are feeling less alienated from

747
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,210
themselves but I think anything that can

748
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,280
I mean in bioethics programs this is a

749
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,100
huge field of study I think it's gonna

750
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,050
keep bioethicists psychologists

751
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,490
sociologists and honestly attorney is

752
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,130
too busy you know for the next couple of

753
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,230
decades until it's over and it will be

754
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,060
over this particular thing will be over

755
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,740
because the world of people who who had

756
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,020
this kind of secret regarding identity

757
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,740
kept from them that's that's coming to

758
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,700
an end because it has to it has to not

759
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,410
because it's bad or wrong it has to

760
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,560
because it's all coming out so I really

761
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,320
think 2025 years from now the idea that

762
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,490
there were ever these kinds of secrets

763
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,740
it's just gonna be like like what do you

764
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,480
mean that's so crazy why would anybody

765
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,940
do that

766
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,359
it's interesting you you say that I

767
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,220
think in part because I think the

768
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,609
broader privacy field is kind of going

769
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:51,460
down the line of privacy ethics and and

770
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,900
realizing that and if the notice

771
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,760
tick-box consent that you described at

772
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,859
the beginning is is just not doing

773
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:02,349
enough and we need to think about ethics

774
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,280
and Trust and I think maybe with that I

775
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,060
will thank you so much for for joining

776
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,030
us here this was incredible really

777
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,310
appreciate your time and wish you luck

778
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,500
at the Music Hall tonight I'm sure it

779
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,990
will be wonderful and so thank you and

780
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,040
thank you to all of you
