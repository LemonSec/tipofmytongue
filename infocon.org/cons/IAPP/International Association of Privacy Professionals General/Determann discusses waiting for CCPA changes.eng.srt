1
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,390
I think companies should see whether

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,070
there are changes what

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,330
to do and whether this federal

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,640
legislation which i think is imminent

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,619
and I expect it within the next 10 to 15

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,640
years but they should not wait to

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,860
prepare for this my sense is that the

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,200
California consumer privacy acts

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,900
restrictions on selling are not going to

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,870
be eliminated by January 1 2020 in

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,730
California they will more likely be

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,750
popping up in other states and if there

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,610
is a federal law it would be quite

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,580
likely that any company is now working

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,360
on identifying selling eliminating it

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,090
where it's not necessary or qualifying

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,730
at the bolster user control and company

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,230
control quite frankly over where the

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,320
data goes will not regret that later and

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,879
say oh my god I wish I hadn't done this

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,530
work I think they will need to do that

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,460
so I would say yes to the see no to the

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,920
wait and therefore ultimately no to the

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,410
wait-and-see approach I think companies

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,590
should act now to prepare for the

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,899
January 1 2020 deadline I want to say

27
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,090
one other thing on that and this is only

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,310
for any viewers who happen to be in the

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,830
California Legislature if you keep

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,570
changing this law throughout 2019 which

31
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,150
i think is a good idea and I made a

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,970
number of requests in my open letter to

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,030
you that we should have some Corrections

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,759
of errors in the bill but if you

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,799
changing it also substantively which

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,680
both sides are requesting then I think

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,110
you should strongly consider the impact

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,119
of retroactivity on companies and

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,070
whether it wouldn't be appropriate to

40
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,689
give everybody another year to prepare

41
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,649
for this and maybe move the effective

42
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,360
day not just the enforcement day but the

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,799
effective date to January 1 20 21

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,600
companies are already working on this

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,019
and they could benefit from another year

46
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,120
after the legislative process is

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,160
finalized we have more than 40 bills

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,549
right now floating in Sacramento many of

49
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,620
them have very good points some of them

50
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,200
are very controversial and if there are

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,370
about to be passed either this spring or

52
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,829
maybe in the fall I think companies

53
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,610
should have a little

54
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,500
extra time to prepare for that and I

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,260
think it would also reduce the risk from

56
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,180
the government's perspective that cases

57
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,650
would be brought that raised the

58
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,250
constitutional concerns regarding

59
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,010
retroactive changes of the legal

60
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,810
environment given that the law has and

61
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,190
probably will continue to have a

62
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,080
one-year look-back which right now is to

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,110
January 1 2019 and so if companies are

64
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,380
now looking at the current version of

65
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,060
the law to prepare for January 1 2020

66
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,250
with the 12-month look back and we're

67
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,400
changing the law throughout 2019 and

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,630
then we're expecting the Attorney

69
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,520
General to come up with regulations to

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,239
reflect the changed law I think it is

71
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,420
unnecessarily

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,450
rushed and we should give another year

73
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,430
to everyone to adapt to whatever the

74
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,830
final version of this law will say by

75
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,200
the end of this year this is not a

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,570
wait-and-see to companies I think they

77
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,630
should see and start working on it and I

78
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,730
definitely don't recommend to get their

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,080
hopes up but I think from the

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
legislators perspective it would be a

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,470
wise consideration to give another year

82
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,840
after the dust settles on what the final

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,610
wording of this statute is
