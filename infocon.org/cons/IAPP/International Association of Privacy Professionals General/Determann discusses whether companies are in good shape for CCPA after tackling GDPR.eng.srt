1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,250
companies that have worked on compliance

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,450
with the general data protection

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,529
regulation of the European Union are

4
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:23,480
definitely better prepared to comply

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,340
with the California consumer Privacy Act

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,189
and companies who have not I feel sorry

7
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,130
for those of my clients who have a

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,040
domestic focus and who were spared by

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,219
the GDP are only to now find that they

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,489
have this much more rigid prescriptive

11
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,090
and intrusive law to comply with which

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,180
may come particularly if we get a right

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,340
of private action which much more harsh

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,130
enforcement and companies who have

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,680
already worked on GDP are typically have

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,600
a better sense of what systems they're

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
using what vendors they have they can

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,680
send out communications to vendors more

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,170
quickly they can find what data they

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,269
have better to update the data privacy

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,130
notices they have probably some

22
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,189
experience with data subject access

23
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,630
deletion and portability requests which

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,570
are also going to be coming forward

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,430
under the California consumer Privacy

26
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,159
Act and therefore they are generally in

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,600
better shape they typically have a

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,850
governance program accountability they

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,469
have people in their company who are in

30
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,630
charge of privacy and this will make

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,130
things easier but the CCPA the

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,109
California consumer Privacy Act is not

33
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:39,979
anywhere close to being a mini gdpr as

34
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,700
some have called it it has nearly as

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,659
many words the GPR weighs in with 30,000

36
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,319
words but it has a lot of stuff that is

37
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,090
not in the California consumer privacy

38
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,249
acts such as Data Protection Authority

39
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,810
organization coordination within Europe

40
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,749
filing requirements consultations

41
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,420
produce accountability documentation

42
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,419
under five to 24 and 32 under the GD P R

43
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,010
we have various paperwork and

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,290
formalistic requirements that the GPR

45
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,810
imposes on companies which California

46
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,970
companies also have to grapple with but

47
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,720
under many other laws the California

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,090
consumer Privacy Act is not an omnibus

49
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,730
it's one of literally hundreds of laws

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,530
that we already have in California on a

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,970
federal level that companies have to

52
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,120
comply with on top of all these other

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,940
laws so companies that sometimes come to

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,260
me that say well we're already doing

55
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,959
gdpr so we don't have to do that much is

56
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,069
not probably an accurate assessment of

57
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:46,970
the situation

58
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,880
the California consumer Privacy Act is

59
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,709
in the tradition of California and us

60
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,510
privacy laws that focus on a particular

61
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,200
problem harm situation sector it is

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,660
broader than many privacy laws that

63
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,850
we've seen before but it is trying to

64
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,150
address perceived harms and threats

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,769
associated with sharing of personal data

66
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,680
by anybody in the industry it is broader

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,110
it's not a sectoral law but it is

68
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,110
focused on data sharing with 10,000

69
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,000
words and these super constrictive

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,980
requirements whereas the gdpr

71
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,319
tries to govern everything else relating

72
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,500
to data and is really a data processing

73
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,670
regulation rather than a privacy law

74
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,440
because it is not that focused on

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,000
individual privacy harms it just

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,730
generally tries to limit the amount of

77
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,530
data that is being processed how long it

78
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,420
is processed for what purposes companies

79
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,970
have to justify to process personal data

80
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,130
all that is not the case under the

81
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,109
California law the California law just

82
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,819
put some rigid restrictions and

83
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,790
individual rights into effect that will

84
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,920
limit the amount of data that companies

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,350
can share and use and collect and that

86
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,989
is a different focus and so I would say

87
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:55,910
to all the companies that have done a

88
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,799
good job on GDP our compliance you're in

89
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,690
good shape you're in better shape you're

90
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,569
ahead but they still work to be done

91
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,550
you
