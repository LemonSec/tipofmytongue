1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,269
welcome to the demo for the US federal

2
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:09,430
agency privacy threshold analysis and

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,980
privacy impact assessment in this demo

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,360
these two templates will be linked

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,009
together to demonstrate how they can be

6
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,779
used to first gather preliminary

7
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,700
information about a project or system

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,559
and determine whether a full privacy

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,169
impact assessment is required and second

10
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:24,790
to conduct the full privacy impact

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,460
assessment if necessary these templates

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,899
are based on the Department of Homeland

13
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,969
Security's privacy threshold analysis

14
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,309
and privacy impact assessment templates

15
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,489
which are publicly available at DHS gov

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,400
to begin the workflow the project

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,810
approver would assign the privacy

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,120
threshold analysis to a respondent who

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
typically would be someone at a

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,110
component office of the agency the

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,820
respondent would then fill out the PTA

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,320
and submit it back to the approver the

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,780
PTA includes a variety of question types

24
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,899
including freeform text multi-select

25
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:11,700
questions as well as yes/no responses

26
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:23,570
the threshold also includes a section

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,549
where the respondent can provide their

28
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,409
own recommendation as to whether or not

29
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:32,229
the PIAA or other steps are required

30
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,729
after the respondent has completed the

31
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,740
threshold and submitted it back to the

32
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,869
approver the approver can then review

33
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,189
the answers that were provided by the

34
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:59,409
respondent here they can flag risks add

35
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,280
recommendations for how to mitigate the

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,539
risk as well as request more information

37
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:10,519
is needed the approver can then add

38
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,769
their determination of whether or not a

39
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:16,870
P ia or other next steps are required

40
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,020
if the approver determines that a PIAA

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,510
is needed it can then be sent to the

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,800
respondent who will be greeted with

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,900
welcome text explaining what a PIAA is

44
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,760
what it should accomplish and its

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
purposes the respondent can then begin

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,230
to move through the various sections and

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,380
answer the PIAA questions the questions

48
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,040
are a combination of freeform text

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,329
multi-select and yes/no questions

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,599
each question also includes a text box

51
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,190
where the respondent can provide

52
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,099
additional information or context where

53
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,680
necessary this allows the federal agency

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,959
to provide the narrative based PIAA in

55
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,030
order to tell the story to the executive

56
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,190
branch or to the public at large in

57
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,530
accordance with the Privacy Act any

58
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,129
Government Act

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,510
when the respondent is finished they can

60
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,040
then submit the PIAA back to the

61
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,320
approver so that they can review the

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,970
answers once again the approver will

63
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,710
have the opportunity to review the

64
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,880
answers that were provided by the

65
00:03:48,880 --> 00:04:02,500
respondent flag risks provide any

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,630
recommendations on how to mitigate the

67
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,959
risk and request additional information

68
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,000
if needed

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,500
once the approver is satisfied with the

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,040
PIAA

71
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,050
they can continue to risk tracking

72
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,329
here the approver can review all of the

73
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,250
risk that was flagged by the PIAA add

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,960
additional descriptions or

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,670
recommendations on how to mitigate the

76
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,770
risk as well as provide additional

77
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,560
internal notes once the approver is

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,750
satisfied they can complete risk

79
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,410
tracking and complete the project this

80
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,000
concludes the demo for the US federal

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,280
agency privacy threshold analysis and

82
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
privacy impact assessment templates
