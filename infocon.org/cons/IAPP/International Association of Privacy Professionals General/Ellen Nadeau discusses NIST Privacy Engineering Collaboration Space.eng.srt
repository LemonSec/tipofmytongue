1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,100
the privacy engineering collaboration

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,170
space NIST launched earlier this year

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,180
it's a place where practitioners can

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,790
share and discuss open source solutions

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,590
for privacy engineering and risk

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,280
management

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,710
so our two initial focus areas are D

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,509
identification and privacy risk

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,730
assessments in they did on vacation

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,680
space under this broad umbrella we've

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,390
received a variety of great submissions

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,880
from both educational institutions

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,949
private sector really across the board

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,529
sector wise and so a lot of these

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,939
submissions have been focused on

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,189
differential privacy at its most basic

17
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,230
level differential privacy is about

18
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,200
managing privacy risks by introducing

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
noise into datasets and so we really

20
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,640
hope that more folks will you know begin

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,469
to engage with the collaboration space

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,600
to try out this these techniques and

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,969
provide feedback and also offer abuse

24
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,980
cases so that you know other people can

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,600
introduce tools that might help them

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,010
resolve problems they're currently

27
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,620
having so we encourage people to sign on

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,339
and try it out
