1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I started writing about privacy about 20

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,370
years ago and no one taught me more

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,280
about what privacy is and why we should

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,599
care about it than Allen Weston as early

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,410
as the early 1960s Allen was thinking

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,439
and writing about privacy in a way that

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,420
would make a difference for the decades

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,090
to come he was the first to understand

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,470
the implications that computer

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,110
technology had as well as other kinds of

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,530
automated technology or personal privacy

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,870
he saw the tensions that today exists

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,190
between privacy and freedom and

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,660
individualization and all sorts of

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,140
things and control surveillance he saw

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,840
that all coming together well before

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,550
almost anybody else did his seminal book

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,760
privacy and freedom defined privacy as

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,280
the ability to control how much about

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,799
ourselves we will deal to others Allen

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,350
Weston early on understood the value of

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,659
bringing together a community of people

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,509
to work on privacy issues whether it was

24
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,000
from business government or advocacy

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,820
groups and some of that early work he

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,070
did in bringing groups together really

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,530
inspired the formation of the

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,630
International Association of privacy

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,390
professionals I can't think of a more

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,939
appropriate tribute to Allen's legacy

31
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,090
than the Western fellowships organized

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,520
by the ia PP to identify young promising

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,229
scholars and thinkers in the field of

34
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,960
privacy to support them to allow them to

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,320
do their work it marries two of his

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,979
great interest one of course privacy

37
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,149
research privacy writing the academic

38
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,259
side of his life's work with the other

39
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,770
side which is making it practical making

40
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,550
it meaning

41
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,030
well embedding it in America's

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,130
corporations we need people who are able

43
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,670
to look beyond just the immediate

44
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,200
problem to be solved beyond the

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,690
immediate profit to be made these

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,160
fellows I hope will be men and women of

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,410
not only great confidence in this but

48
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,590
also great foresight and

49
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,970
multidisciplinary because we're

50
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,280
realizing more and more it takes many

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,740
disciplines to attack these kind of

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,050
problems it will cultivate young

53
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,820
scholars and thinkers at precisely the

54
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,170
moment that they need the most support

55
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,110
and intellectual freedom and in that

56
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,690
sense it's just a perfect tribute to

57
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,350
Allen's legacy this has been such an

58
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,870
honor for Allen he's had lots of honors

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,790
as you can well imagine during his

60
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,430
professional life but he's been really

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,420
touched by this and he feels that this

62
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,920
program will be extraordinarily with his

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,510
fellowship and with other programs and

64
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,209
actions I think we're all taking to help

65
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,510
grow the ia PP and the professions I

66
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,760
hope that we will be and I know we're

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,160
going to be worthy stewards of Alan's

68
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,330
legacy privacy issues now permeate many

69
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,950
facets of our individual and family

70
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,250
lives our social and cultural minus our

71
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,130
state and national politics and key

72
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,320
relationships of us all with employers

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,110
businesses and government we have come

74
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,090
to realize that how well democracies

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,550
balance the competing demands of privacy

76
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,160
disclosure and surveillance will exert a

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,470
major influence on the quality of civic

78
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,500
life in the 21st century and that

79
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,420
shaping this balance will now have to be

80
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,670
done in the context of continuing

81
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,580
terrorist threats and actions in short

82
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,580
privacy is a quality of life topic worth

83
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,370
the best scholarship thoughtful advocacy

84
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,880
and continuing attention of us all thank

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,170
you very much for coming this evening

86
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,580
and we should all get to work

87
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,640
you

88
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,349
