1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,069
how do you learn best classrooms are
great but there are times when it is

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,080
impossible for you to get to one if your
schedule budget or other factors make

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,580
travel difficult you can still get the
benefit of learning and sharing the live

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,310
instructor and classmates live online
privacy training from the iapp right

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,960
let's get started then live online
programs let you participate from

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,239
anywhere in any place with an internet
connection but instead of learning alone

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,440
you are part of an interactive classroom
where you can connect with your

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,690
instructor and classmates see if your
classmates from around the world face

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,039
the same challenge as you do answer
prompts and quizzes from your instructor

10
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,410
and talk to your instructor one-on-one
you can even raise your hand to be

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,089
recognized just like in the live
classroom but unlike a live classroom

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,250
you can review the recording of your
live online experience over and over to

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,069
help you retain the information all this
without the concerns of travelling to

14
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,020
and from classes it's a great way to
begin your training journey without

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,280
having to journey at all hope to see you
at the meditation thank you very much
