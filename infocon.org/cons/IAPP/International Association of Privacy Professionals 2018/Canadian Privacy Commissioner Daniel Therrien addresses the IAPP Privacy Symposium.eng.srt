1
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,670
I want to now take the time to introduce

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,849
our first keynote speaker and we call it

3
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,279
the keynote speaker because every year

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,529
during his mandate he's always agreed

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,500
even in difficult times and when it

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,750
conflicts with his schedule he always

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,380
somehow manages to make it work and and

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,540
it's to hear from the Privacy

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,739
Commissioner of Canada

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,930
Daniel Terry and his annual address to

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,879
the profession Commissioner Terry a was

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:49,170
appointed in in June of 2014 after three

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,269
decades serving Canadians as a lawyer

14
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,999
with various federal departments and

15
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,710
human rights issues were we're we're

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,489
human rights issues were important he

17
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,679
said that the overarching goal of his

18
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,479
mandate is to increase the control of

19
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,760
Canadians have over their personal

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,240
information and I think his remarks this

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,340
morning will probably touch on this

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,430
overarching goal since his appointment

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,770
he is champion privacy rights in the

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,259
public debate over national security and

25
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:19,950
public safety

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,350
he's led research and investigations

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,600
into privacy issues that go to the heart

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,869
of consumer trust and confidence and and

29
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,619
I'm sure we will have a lot to learn

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,039
from his remarks this morning please

31
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,600
join me in welcoming Commissioner Daniel

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,500
Terry to the stage

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,260
[Applause]

34
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,750
good morning I'd like to be here in

35
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,229
Toronto to for this annual address like

36
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,310
to see all of you and we have a few

37
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,459
announcements to make today that may not

38
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,889
be as riveting as the gdpr

39
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:16,400
but we'll try our best at this midway

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,040
point of my mandate as Privacy

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,690
Commissioner it has become increasingly

42
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,660
clear to me that to have a more positive

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,819
impact on the privacy rights of a

44
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,340
greater number of Canadians we at the

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,829
OPC need to change our approach to

51
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,209
here I am NOT referring to the need to

52
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,970
modernize our laws although that remain

53
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,060
that remains in ssed

54
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,000
even more so in my view after the

legislation is of course not within the

58
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,989
OPC remit but we are not waiting for

59
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,130
government to act what we're trying to

60
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,769
do is to breathe new life into old laws

61
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,480
with a vision of a more proactive

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,840
approach to privacy protection you may

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,099
recall that this is something I

64
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,579
discussed at this conference last year

65
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,310
but since then we have fine-tuned this

66
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,000
new approach we've set some ambitious

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,709
goals for our work we've made some

68
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,950
important structural changes at the OPC

69
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,780
and we are putting our vision into

70
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,620
concrete action so these are the themes

71
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,900
that I want to focus on most in my

72
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,669
remarks today the context that all of

73
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,709
you are aware of is that the scale and

74
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,990
pace of technological advances and

75
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,790
use in business and government

76
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,340
organizations are significantly

77
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,500
straining the ability of individuals to

78
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,560
protect their privacy innovation in the

79
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,080
areas of data analytics artificial

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,450
intelligence genetic profiling and the

81
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,540
Internet of Things raises novel and

82
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,130
highly complex privacy risks now we

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,988
realize that these technologies are

84
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,660
necessary for economic growth and to

85
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,150
improve government services but they

86
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,130
must be used in a manner that respects

87
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,980
the privacy of Canadians people want

88
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,010
both we also believe that many

89
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,960
organizations want to do the right thing

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,300
and we want to help them with that and I

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,800
have a few announcements on that point

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,180
this morning as such and to address some

93
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,700
of the challenges we face we've made

94
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,050
significant changes to our

95
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,900
organizational structure that we believe

96
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,120
will help us achieve better results for

97
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,000
privacy

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,070
we have streamline our operations by

99
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,680
clarifying program functions and

100
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,650
reporting relationships and B and we've

101
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,230
become more forward-looking by shifting

102
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,320
the balance of our activities towards

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,740
greater proactive efforts our objective

104
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,350
as I descend is to have a broader and

105
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,420
more positive impact on the privacy

106
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,140
rights of a greater number of Canadians

107
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,880
which is not always possible when

108
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,220
focusing most of our attention on the

109
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,690
investigation of individual complaints

110
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,790
with that in mind our work will now fall

111
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,150
into one of two program areas promotion

112
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,660
or compliance activities aimed at

113
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,450
bringing departments and organizations

114
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,970
towards compliance with the law will

115
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,850
fall under the promotion program while

116
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,010
those related to addressing existing

117
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,680
compliance issues will fall under the

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,860
compliance program in the coming weeks I

119
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,480
will be announcing the two deputy

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,760
commissioners who will oversee these two

121
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,440
new sectors now we know that a

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,870
successful regulator is not one that

123
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,140
uses enforcement as a first or primary

124
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,870
strategy to seek compliance

125
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,270
thus our first strategy will be under

126
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,700
the promotion program to inform

127
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,350
Canadians of their rights and how to

128
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,410
exercise them and to guide and engage

129
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,040
with organizations on how to comply with

130
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,190
our privacy obligations guidance and

131
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,230
information will be issued on most key

132
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,140
privacy issues starting with how to

133
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,270
achieve meaningful consent in today's

134
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,210
complex digital environment which I will

135
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,630
discuss in greater detail in a moment so

136
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,660
I notice Chris that your recent book

137
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,670
speaks of law and policy maybe you'll

138
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,910
need to update your book given the

139
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,730
amount of guidance we intend to publish

140
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,320
we will also work with industry

141
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,690
proactively and collaboratively in an

142
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,890
advisory capacity

143
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,620
that's a bit newer to the extent our

144
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,980
limited resources allow we will seek to

145
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,230
better understand privacy impacts of new

146
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,840
technologies and provide practical

147
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,510
advice on how to use them in a Privacy

148
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,170
compliant way addressing privacy issues

149
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,090
upfront and resolving matters

150
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,150
cooperatively outside formal enforcement

151
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,750
is our preferred approach it avoids

152
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,200
time-consuming and costly investigations

153
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,000
helps mitigate against future privacy

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,420
risks offers organizations a measure of

155
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,330
consistency and predictability in their

156
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,610
dealings with our office and I'm open to

157
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,820
questions on that point after and allows

158
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,840
everyone to benefit from innovation it

159
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,340
is for these reasons that we will

160
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,440
primarily consider our promotion tools

161
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,160
before engaging our second strategy

162
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,830
proactive enforcement under the

163
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,510
compliance program our proactive

164
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,000
enforcement actions will target systemic

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,880
chronic or sector specific privacy

166
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,410
issues that are not being addressed

167
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,740
through our complaint system and that we

168
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,930
believe may inflict significant diamonds

169
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,730
to the damage to the privacy rights of

170
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,310
Canadians

171
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,290
so by delineating our activities more

172
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,720
clearly under two programs compliance

173
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,250
and promotion by being more proactive

174
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,920
and by ensuring that we are citizen

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,560
focused giving practical actionable

176
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,230
advice both to Canadians and to

177
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,220
organizations

178
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,830
I hope Canadians may begin to feel more

179
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,659
empowered and in control of their

180
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,630
personal information and generally safer

181
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,549
in a knowledge that their rights will be

182
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,240
respected now I'd like to elaborate on

183
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,160
some of the work we will be doing in the

184
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,500
coming year under this new approach and

185
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,220
this new structure through our

186
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,010
restructuring the new business advisory

187
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,520
Directorate formerly the Toronto office

188
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,470
that will continue to be in Toronto but

189
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,120
will have slightly amended mandate that

190
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,310
Directorate will aim to provide advice

191
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,640
to businesses subject to pivot on in

192
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,340
part we want to proactively engage with

193
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,800
organizations on a voluntary basis on

194
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,010
privacy risks at a high-impact nature

195
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,190
either upon request or based on our own

196
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,270
intelligence the aim of this to gain a

197
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,250
better understanding of innovative new

198
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,740
business models and practices and to

199
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,660
address and potentially resolve any

200
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,430
privacy concerns before they materialize

201
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,160
we also want to explore the possibility

202
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,100
through pilots because resources will be

203
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,800
an issue we have too few resources for

204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,310
this of responding to advice requests

205
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,260
for smaller businesses who are not

206
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,940
necessarily at the cutting edge of

207
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,220
technology but who nevertheless have a

208
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,080
significant impact on the privacy of

209
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,290
Canadians given resource pressures as I

210
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,150
said we will need to be selective at

211
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,400
least for the moment in deciding which

212
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,300
projects we are going to take on by the

213
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,640
way the Toronto office will no longer

214
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,790
perform investigations this is because

215
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,170
we want to make a clear delineation

216
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,030
between compliance and promotion

217
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,580
functions the business advisory

218
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,089
Directorate is part of promotion it is

219
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,620
when you get a call from PIPA de

220
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,900
investigations and compliance that you

221
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,829
should start to worry

222
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,240
so this year on the engagement front I'm

223
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,339
pleased to announce the first advisory

224
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,130
project initiated by my office which is

225
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,190
now underway it relates to sidewalk

226
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,279
Toronto a smart city and ever between

227
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,350
Waterfront Toronto and sidewalk lands

228
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,540
owned by Google's parent company

229
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,950
alphabet the initiative which I expect

230
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,810
most of you are familiar with involves

231
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,520
building a technology driven

232
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,830
neighborhood on the city's eastern

233
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,860
waterfront that includes sensors aimed

234
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,930
at helping city planners find

235
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,190
efficiencies understandably this

236
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,900
initiative is raising many questions

237
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,390
about data collection privacy where the

238
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,670
information will be stored how it might

239
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,770
be used including whether it will be

240
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,520
sold or used for marketing purposes last

241
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,970
month

242
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,920
members of our business advisory

243
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,440
Directorate along with a colleague from

244
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,500
the Ontario IPC met with those behind

245
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,990
the project to learn more about it and

246
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,610
how they were addressing some of these

247
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,060
privacy concerns overall we were

248
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,740
encouraged by their efforts to

249
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,420
proactively address privacy and data

250
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,730
security and the design and

251
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,790
implementation of the initiative we

252
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,250
reminded officials of key privacy

253
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,380
principles including purpose

254
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,170
specification of course with some degree

255
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,540
of granularity ensuring individuals

256
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,970
could access their own personal

257
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,250
information and being accountable for

258
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,650
protecting that the data and being fear

259
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,850
about who owns it we also emphasized as

260
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,589
you might imagine the importance of high

261
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,300
standards and techniques when it comes

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,570
to di notification of data to mitigate

263
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,450
the risk of re-identification and that

264
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,310
any open that a component to the

265
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,320
initiative would be done in a privacy

266
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,760
protective manner given that the project

267
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,470
is still in its early stages we will

268
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,300
continue to monitor developments and

269
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,490
proactively engage with sidewalk auto

270
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,140
officials as it progresses the

271
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,600
government sign our government advisory

272
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,550
Directorate is also in the business of

273
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,130
giving advice to federal departments and

274
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,300
institutions

275
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,940
and we plan to do more of this going

276
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,610
forward again with the philosophy of

277
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,410
bringing departments towards compliance

278
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,110
with the law as they deliver services to

279
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,040
Canadians we were we recently concluded

280
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,019
a series of stakeholder engagement

281
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,870
sessions with federal departments to

282
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,329
help inform our efforts as we realign

283
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:07,670
our advisory services we are

284
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,620
consistently asked to provide more

285
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,209
guidance to individuals on how to

286
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,190
exercise their privacy rights and to

287
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,019
organizations on how to respect their

288
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,110
obligations resources permitting we have

289
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,790
committed to doing just that and have

290
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,600
identified 30 topics on which to get

291
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,940
started these are found in our annual

292
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,610
report the consent report of the fall of

293
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,720
2017 at the top of the list our consent

294
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,649
and no-go zones I'm pleased to announce

295
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,110
today that our final guidelines for

296
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,240
organizations on obtaining meaningful

297
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,310
consent and inappropriate data practices

298
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,550
are available it should be on our site

299
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,570
as we speak as I speak the consent

300
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,270
guidelines are in fact a joint effort

301
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,600
with our Alberta and British Columbia

302
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,690
counterparts because we share the no

303
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,910
signaling direct risk so that national

304
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,270
morality in accept I'm I'm at Celtic at

305
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,020
Maddy Denis

306
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,209
so on this podium I can't eat noodle

307
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:14,060
jure among other important advice in the

308
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,160
meaningful consent guidance we outline

309
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,829
four elements that must be emphasised in

310
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,440
privacy notices and explained in a

311
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
user-friendly way first what personal

312
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,500
information is being collected second

313
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,940
with which parties it's personal

314
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,940
information being shared third for what

315
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,040
purposes is being collected used or

316
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
disclosed and fourth what are the risks

317
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,290
of harm or other consequences that might

318
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,630
come from any collection use or

319
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,890
disclosure of the information some have

320
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,959
expressed concerns about our decision to

321
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,730
include risk of harm among the four

322
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,970
elements to be emphasized this decision

323
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,400
that were making as a

324
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,220
flows from the definition of valid

325
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,660
consent in the act in Pepita the Act

326
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,700
requires that an individual understand

327
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,220
the nature purposes and importantly the

328
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,830
consequences of the collection use or

329
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,620
disclosure to which they're consenting

330
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,300
among the consequences might be harmful

331
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,680
consequences but what we're talking

332
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,380
about is not any and all risks of any

333
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,290
and all harms what we're talking about

334
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,660
are those residual risks that might

335
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,210
remain despite an organization's best

336
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,790
efforts to apply mitigation measures

337
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,730
designed to minimize risk and impact of

338
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,000
potential harms in the end only

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,050
meaningful residual risks of significant

340
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,850
harm must be included in notifications

341
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,350
risks such as bodily harm

342
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,779
humiliation loss of employment and

343
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,000
identity theft

344
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,650
that fall below the balance of

345
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,410
probabilities but are more than a

346
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,230
minimal or mere possibility that's what

347
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,440
we mean by meaningful risk below the

348
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,080
balance of probabilities but more than a

349
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,300
minimal or mere possibility I know I

350
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,040
know that there may also have been some

351
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,110
concern about binding language in the

352
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,020
guidance while it is clear that we

353
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,089
cannot use guidance to establish new

354
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,000
legal standards we think are all as a

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,279
regulator includes giving guidance that

356
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,529
clarifies fit better requirements and

357
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,959
sets expectations as to how the law

358
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,050
should generally be interpreted and

359
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,400
applied given that PIPA is so broad in

360
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,500
nature individuals and organizations

361
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,630
need an adequate level of certainty

362
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,290
now let me give you a few some examples

363
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,720
of what we mean by guidance that

364
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,150
distinguishes between requirements and

365
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,200
best practices or recommendations the

366
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,579
four elements that I've just mentioned

367
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,369
that according to our guidance needs to

368
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,640
be highlighted or given emphasis in our

369
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,750
view are a requirement because it is not

370
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,150
possible in our view to have meaningful

371
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,790
consent a legal term without giving

372
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,420
emphasis to these four elements now

373
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,920
there's an issue about the level of

374
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,710
detail that each of these elements needs

375
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,050
to have in order to constitute proper

376
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,960
notice but there needs to be emphasis of

377
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,800
the four elements at some level of

378
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,820
specificity but the level of detail will

379
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,970
will depend for instance one of the four

380
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,010
elements is that individuals need to be

381
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,740
informed of the third party's with which

382
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,260
the organization collecting the

383
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,220
information will share the information

384
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,100
the requirement that we for which we see

385
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,440
a clear and direct connection in the act

386
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,740
itself is that these third parties need

387
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,190
to be described in sufficient detail for

388
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,550
the individual to understand what it is

389
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,120
that they're being asked to consent to

390
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,450
we also say in the guidelines as it was

391
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,440
in the draft that ideally all third

392
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,970
parties should be described that is a

393
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,740
recommendation that is not a legal

394
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,550
requirement so third parties need to be

395
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,800
informed need to be in the individuals

396
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,360
need to be informed of the third parties

397
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,440
with which information will be shared

398
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,180
these third parties need to be described

399
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,210
in sufficient detail for individuals

400
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,220
giving consent to understand what

401
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,280
they're giving consent to how many of

402
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,560
them are there how you do that the level

403
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
of specificity the advice that we give

404
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,660
in the guidelines is a recommendation

405
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,019
it's a best practice

406
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:03,679
similarly we speak about layering in the

407
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,690
guidelines and that clearly is a best

408
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,059
practice that's not a legal requirement

409
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,049
so in order to describe for consumers

410
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:15,049
the third parties with which you will

411
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,620
share information that needs to be done

412
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,190
in sufficient details ideally all of

413
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,899
them all of the third parties and

414
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:26,510
layering is a recommended best practice

415
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,659
to get to that point without burdening

416
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,179
the individual getting consent with too

417
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:36,860
much information a very important change

418
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,409
that was made very useful I think point

419
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,389
that the change that was made between

420
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,269
the guidelines that were issued in draft

421
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,779
form in September and what appears today

422
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,350
on our site is that we were we were

423
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,389
asked during the later set of

424
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,679
submissions and discussion with

425
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,320
stakeholders that we had to make the

426
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,389
distinction between what we feel is a

427
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:02,149
legal requirement and what we feel is a

428
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,880
recommendation or a best practice so

429
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,590
that should should be clear through the

430
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,230
words using a guidelines musts insured's

431
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,710
but also at the end there's a checklist

432
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,570
to serve as as a reminder of the

433
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,159
distinction where we see the the advice

434
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,409
that we give as flowing directly from

435
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,740
the act and therefore a requirement

436
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,250
versus best practices as I mentioned we

437
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,139
also launched new guidance on no-go

438
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:37,820
zones and I see that time will go by

439
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,399
pretty quickly so I will just say that

440
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:45,289
the guidelines are also up in final form

441
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:51,289
on 5:3 and in appropriate practices when

442
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:55,159
will these guidelines be applicable the

443
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:57,139
five three guidelines I do not think

444
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,519
there's any reason to delay the

445
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,049
application of them these are

446
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,279
appropriate practice isms so we propose

447
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,870
that they would become applicable very

448
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,649
shortly that is on July 1st however

449
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:11,840
because the consent guidelines may be

450
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,880
our organizations to implement changes

451
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,520
to their systems and practices their

452
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,190
application will begin on January 1st

453
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,740
2019 bar Bucknall our director of policy

454
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,679
will speak more fully to these

455
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,020
guidelines later at the conference I

456
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,720
spoken at length about promotion and

457
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,760
guidance we will continue to of course

458
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,340
undertake investigations and enforcement

459
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,710
in part responding to complaints as you

460
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,350
know we have an obligation to

461
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,279
investigate complaints that are

462
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,080
presented to us subject to very few

463
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,630
exceptions but we will also undertake

464
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,149
proactive investigations as I mentioned

465
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,370
particularly in areas that are more

466
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,149
opaque or less obvious for individual

467
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,230
consumers and on that front I'm

468
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,330
announcing today that we're proceeding

469
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,669
with our first proactive industry-wide

470
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,820
Commissioner initiated investigation

471
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,679
into the privacy management practices of

472
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,850
data and list brokers organizations that

473
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,130
deal in lists are responsible for how

474
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,289
the information is compiled which

475
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,570
includes obtaining consent from those on

476
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,630
the lists preliminary inquiries with

477
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,370
industry practices have raised a number

478
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,679
of concerns about how databases of

479
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,169
Canadians detail personal information

480
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:38,600
are being compiled and then subsequently

481
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,630
disclosed to marketers detailed profiles

482
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,850
about individuals may be inaccurate and

483
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,190
could be accessed and used for purposes

484
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,110
that individuals may know nothing about

485
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,620
as such our investigation will look at

486
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,779
accountability openness and transparency

487
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,330
in the management of personal

488
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,220
information collected used and disclosed

489
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,950
as well as the means of consent obtained

490
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,289
for the personal information collected

491
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,950
used or disclosed in total will we will

492
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,080
be investigating the practices of six

493
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,390
different data brokers this would

494
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,850
include a consideration of castle and

495
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,520
the address harvesting provisions and

496
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,990
force by my office we believe that this

497
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,549
industry can benefit from an

498
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:23,830
investigation of this nature

499
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,290
and that Canadian consumers will welcome

500
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,860
it

501
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,110
I understand Brent Holman will be

502
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,400
speaking more to our proactive

503
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,690
compliance efforts in another panel so

504
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,190
in closing I think you will agree that

505
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,350
we have set an ambitious agenda

506
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,160
not to mention homework for Chris by

507
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,190
