1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,119
I must say when I got the call from the

2
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,759
IDP about you award I was speechless

3
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,640
there are a great deal of very fine

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,969
privacy lawyers all over the world and

5
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,410
to be chosen by them and amongst them

6
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,649
for this work is more than anyone can

7
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,789
dream of so we are very grateful and

8
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,410
very honored

9
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,550

10
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,430
now you may notice that that's it we

11
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,640
rather than up wait we are grateful and

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,840
we in the resistance for the 60 other

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,500
privacy lawyers at Covington and Burling

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,210
as I said I'm sitting here in Brussels

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,580
and we have a privacy team here in

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,460
Brussels but we also have a privacy team

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,250
in our London office in our Washington

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,180
DC office in our New York office in San

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,119
Francisco in Silicon Valley and last but

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,960
not least in Beijing so group of 16

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,860
lawyers all in total during privacy

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,780
working with one another and making this

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,689
award possible so the award is very much

24
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,880
for all of them every single one of them

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,070
rather than just me I'm just a lucky

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,280
recipient of it in person but I speak on

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,820
behalf of

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,820
I remember as if it was yesterday and

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,920
this some 15 years ago when I started

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,540
doing privacy I got very offering them

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,729
apply but interesting what do you

32
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,190
actually do what does the privacy lawyer

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,450
do I don't get that question anymore

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,430
privacy has entered into everydays life

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,850
it entered into newspapers it entered in

36
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,569
on the political agenda and probably the

37
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,959
most important of all it ended into the

38
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,819
boardrooms there's a very great demand

39
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,640
for privacy lawyers obviously in Europe

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,190
with the GDP arm and the requirement for

41
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,840
many companies to have a data protection

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,900
office but from anything that I can see

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,790
sitting here in Brussels the demand is

44
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,630
also outside of the EU but it also has

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,519
something to do with developments in

46
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,290
other parts of the world I'm thinking

47
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,230
China I think in Asia where many of

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,269
these countries have interesting new

49
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,980
rules that require specialized expertise

50
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,720
so if you want to become that privacy

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,120
lawyer or continue on your path to be a

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,280
privacy law you will obviously be doing

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,989
privacy and you will find this party

54
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,549
intellectually rewarding but also

55
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:21,160
ever-expanding thank you again to the

56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,150
IPP thank you 260 colleagues comment on

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,100
a burden and thank you to you all for

58
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,700
listening

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,629
