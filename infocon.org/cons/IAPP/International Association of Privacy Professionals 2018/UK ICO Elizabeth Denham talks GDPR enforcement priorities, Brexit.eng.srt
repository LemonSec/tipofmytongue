2
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:18,270
and I think intensive is a very good

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,039
word to describe this event because the

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,670
expectation and the scrutiny on all of

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,590
us to step up and make change is intense

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,230
it's clear the data protection is

7
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:45,120
essential for our democracy and that's

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,970
why last spring my office launched

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,250
comprehensive inquiry into the use of

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,350
data protection in political campaigns

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,540
the Cambridge analytic Facebook

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,170
allegations is only one line of inquiry

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,400
in our broader investigation but of

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,160
course that line of inquiry was

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,010
heightened in February when

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,370
whistleblowers came forward with their

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,900
stories in all in our inquiry we're

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,410
looking at 30 organizations social media

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,650
platforms data companies political

20
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,520
campaigns political parties to pull back

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,310
the curtain and to be able to understand

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,900
how the use of personal data takes place

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,570
in modern political campaigns so our

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,970
report is going to describe the

25
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,000
realities of the data driven campaign

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,380
are the rules clear how is personal data

27
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,290
use enabling the micro targeting of

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,010
adverts and campaigns what public policy

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,240
changes can we recommend one thing I

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,170
will say is that I've never been

31
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,260
involved in an

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,900
investigation that is playing out so

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,349
publicly with witnesses giving evidence

34
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,500
on YouTube with witnesses coming forward

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,439
to Congress coming forward to Parliament

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:32,069
and so many details published online

37
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,940
speculation is rife but our

38
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,489
investigation will be thorough

39
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,790
it'll be independent it'll be focused

40
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,690
and we will make our findings and our

41
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,120
conclusions public if we find that the

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,840
law has been breached we will take the

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,650
necessary enforcement action but as I've

44
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,459
mentioned this investigation is ongoing

45
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,639
this investigation is live and it

46
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,769
wouldn't be appropriate for me to give

47
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,540
you a running commentary but I do want

48
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,810
to use this case to comment on our

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,530
powers and also on the unique nature of

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,120
data protection regulation has a

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,500
regulator we need to investigate systems

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,030
in six you to see how personal data are

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,340
actually being used and being managed

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,440
the unique nature of modern data

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,319
protection regulation is that our role

56
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,269
means understanding the effect that

57
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,430
algorithms and analytics has on

58
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,660
decision-making we have to look at the

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,260
interrelatedness of data and the effect

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,669
that they have on decisions and we also

61
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,709
may have to look at these effects in

62
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,829
very short time periods and in the

63
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,530
context of a fast-moving investigation

64
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,858
so under the gdpr I will have the power

65
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,659
to audit all of those who hold and use

66
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:26,260
and share personal data so in other

67
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,340
words

68
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,980
soon I'll be able to look behind the

69
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,699
curtain and see what those who hold our

70
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,889
personal data are doing with it but in

71
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,280
the context of this investigation the

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,430
GDP our audit power is already being

73
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,790
outpaced by technological advances in

74
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,800
data analytics and I need I want to see

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,020
that addressed I'm in intense discussion

76
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,470
with government to ensure that as part

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,010
of the data protection bill the ICO has

78
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,070
the ability to move more quickly to

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,979
obtain the information that we need to

80
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,710
carry out our investigations in the

81
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,330
public interest of course we need to

82
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,610
respect the rights of companies but we

83
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,880
also need streamlined warrant processes

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,669
with a lower threshold than we currently

85
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,910
have in the law we need the regime to

86
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,180
reflect the reality that data crimes are

87
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,550
real crimes and as society moves

88
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,300
increasingly online data protection law

89
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,590
needs to have the comprehensive reach

90
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,020
that people would expect of laws in the

91
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:04,150
physical world I wanted to tell you this

92
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,900
morning about how I'm reshaping my

93
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,080
organization so that we can be the

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,389
relevant and the future focused

95
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,419
regulator that all of you expect us to

96
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:24,010
be DP Day is only 27 working days away

97
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,010
by my calculation but the 25th of May

98
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,620
will merely mark the end of the

99
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,159
beginning of a very long journey for

100
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,689
data prefer the data protection

101
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,309
immunity as the regulator of the GDP are

102
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:48,679
we support we educate we consult we

103
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:54,709
audit and we enforce and from my seat

104
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,959
where I sit we're expecting more of

105
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,819
everything

106
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,429
more breach reports because the law

107
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,619
requires it in certain high-risk

108
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,619
situations more complaints because

109
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:09,499
people are becoming more aware of their

110
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,649
data protection rights and greater

111
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,499
engagement with all of you as you turn

112
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:18,469
to us for advice at the outset of your

113
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:23,739
projects and submit your dpi A's to us

114
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,229
I'm leading an ICO that's made up of

115
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,629
incredibly committed people who are

116
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,300
equipped to meet the challenges and the

117
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,789
opportunities that lie ahead for us

118
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,829
they've all given their consent for

119
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,259
their photograph to be shared with you

120
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,969
they really have so what am i doing I'm

121
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,610
strengthening my team in both numbers

122
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,659
and in expertise we'll be ready to

123
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,819
deliver on our responsibilities and

124
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,860
obligations to organizations but also

125
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,869
more importantly to the public the ICO s

126
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,959
future funding model has also been

127
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,050
agreed by Parliament taking our current

128
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,449
budget of twenty four million pounds a

129
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:21,709
year to 38 million in 2018 2019 we're

130
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,199
recruiting at all levels of the

131
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,289
organization for our offices in

132
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,249
Edinburgh and Cardiff Belfast Wilmslow

133
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,708
and London I hope I didn't miss anyone

134
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,129
out to give us the capacity and the

135
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,458
capability and the resilience to be able

136
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,160
to tackle our growing regulatory brief

137
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,350
we have a current headcount of about

138
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,990
five hundred and twenty and we

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,149
expect our numbers to increase to 700 by

140
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,260
2020 and to give you a sense we have

141
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,620
right now 200 caseworkers that are

142
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,860
taking in the complaints from the public

143
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,190
we have a 60 strong enforcement group

144
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,980
that are taking forward investigations

145
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,070
and we have a similar number that are

146
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,920
charged with policy and guidance and

147
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,330
assistance to the community the ICO has

148
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,580
provided a whole suite of resources on

149
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,360
our website including the guide to the

150
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,649
gdpr which has been accessed 2.5 million

151
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,880
times we have interactive checklists we

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,360
have industry specific fa Q's we have a

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,760
special SME helpline which gets 2,500

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,600
calls a week and we're going to be

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,240
assessing our demand for our services as

156
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,140
the gdpr goes live and beyond and adjust

157
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,450
accordingly and I think all of you in

158
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,700
the in the room are in the same place as

159
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,160
I am there's nothing like taking

160
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,640
advantage of a comprehensive change in

161
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,209
the law to develop and to grow and in a

162
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,079
sense to reinvent ourselves so over the

163
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,149
past 18 months the ICO has undergone a

164
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,560
phenomenal internal change program we

165
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,670
know that we need to be the tech savvy

166
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,130
relevant regulator which is why I've

167
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,529
recently published the ICO s

168
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,480
first technology strategy we've

169
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,899
identified three areas of focus cyber

170
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,120
security artificial intelligence and

171
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,020
device tracking and those three areas

172
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,620
will inform our guidance our proactive

173
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,529
work our audits and our advisory

174
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,160
services

175
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,460
and taking proactivity further we want

176
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,290
to recognize that innovation is

177
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,150
absolutely essential in this space we're

178
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,300
working to establish a regulatory

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,810
sandbox for you to beta test your new

180
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,300
initiatives so that we can support

181
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,270
innovative new project new products

182
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,580
digital products and services whilst

183
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,460
ensuring that the right safeguards are

184
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,330
in place we intend to focus our sandbox

185
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,800
on AI applications and will launch this

186
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,850
new program in 2019 after we finish the

187
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,250
consultation that will take place this

188
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,580
year and I I hope that you'll engage

189
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,310
with us fully with our consultation and

190
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,279
bring the benefit of your industry

191
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,470
experience to the IC o----

192
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,640
so our technology strategy is based on

193
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,460
the strong belief that privacy and

194
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,020
innovation go hand-in-hand it also

195
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,710
allows us to build our own technical

196
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,180
skills recruiting and retaining

197
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,700
technology expertise and establishing

198
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,700
partnerships on tech issues with outside

199
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,310
experts with other regulators and

200
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,440
certainly with international networks

201
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,140
we've launched an active secondo

202
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,310
which so far has brought in an influx of

203
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,360
new talent into the office in the form

204
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,080
of legal staff and auditors forensic

205
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,440
digital forensic expertise and

206
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,770
international liaison experts and our

207
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,170
seconded program is over it is

208
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,560
open-ended so will we'd be delighted to

209
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,410
hear from you if you believe your skills

210
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,160
and experience would complement the IC

211
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:16,800
o---- digital regulation has become the

212
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,459
spy

213
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,509
or the backbone that runs through our

214
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,069
entire organization we're also taking

215
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,459
this opportunity to relaunch our

216
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,759
regulatory action policy which sets out

217
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,720
the pragmatic and the policy approach

218
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,939
that we're going to take in discharging

219
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,209
our duty as the UK's data protection

220
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,959
regulator and there'll be more detail on

221
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,389
our regulatory action policy from our

222
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,459
Deputy Commissioner James Dibble

223
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:57,059
Johnston tomorrow I've spent a lot of

224
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,410
time busting myths in this area and I

225
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,160
think particularly misinformation that

226
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,610
massive fines are going to be the ico

227
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,279
default position after the 25th of May I

228
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,050
have no intention of changing our

229
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,610
proportionate and pragmatic approach

230
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,379
after the 25th of May the aim of our

231
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,899
office is to prevent harm and we place

232
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,369
support and compliance at the heart of

233
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:39,059
our regulatory action voluntary

234
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,490
compliance is still the preferred route

235
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,519
but we will back that up with tough

236
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,139
action where it's necessary hefty fines

237
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,809
can and will be levied on those are

238
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:58,110
organizations that persistently that

239
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,439
deliberately and negligently flout the

240
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:09,269
law report to us engage with us show us

241
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,999
your effective accountability measures

242
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,389
and if you do that's going to be a

243
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,509
really important factor when we consider

244
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:24,629
any regulatory action and now we have a

245
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,740
whole new set of tools for compliance

246
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,170
privacy by default design

247
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,709
to protection officers accountability

248
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:38,380
mechanisms all of these things and more

249
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,519
form an integrated package and when we

250
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,730
do apply a sanction fines will not

251
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,600
always be the most appropriate or the

252
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,370
most effective choice compulsory data

253
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,110
protection audits reprimands warnings

254
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,260
enforcement notices and stop processing

255
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,990
orders are often going to be the most

256
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,230
appropriate tools and none of those

257
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,139
tools involves writing a check to the

258
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,410
Treasury but they will have a

259
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,290
significant impact on a company's body

260
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,560
and thought them line another of the

261
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,660
myths that I've worked really hard to

262
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,510
dispel is around data breach reporting

263
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,079
under the gdpr

264
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,730
and I know we've said it many times but

265
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,040
it's worth repeating that you will not

266
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,279
need to report all personal data

267
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:46,820
breaches to the ICO please don't but

268
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,180
where you do need to report we've tried

269
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,240
to make the reporting process simple and

270
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,390
effective and part of our change

271
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,760
management program has included

272
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,480
researching the best ways to manage the

273
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,299
new volumes of work created by the GDP

274
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,959
ours reporting regime and so looking

275
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,809
across the continent has really helped

276
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,640
us plan in an informed way we

277
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,049
extrapolated from the work of our Dutch

278
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,919
colleagues and we plan to put in place a

279
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,970
breach reporting service that can handle

280
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,690
30,000 reports a year so quite a

281
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,850
challenge to resource so we've built a

282
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,980
telephone based reporting service that

283
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,210
ensures fast direct entry to the ICO

284
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,679
but if you call our breach reporting

285
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,600
line you will get a human response and

286
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,659
our focus will be on identifying whether

287
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,480
your breach is a reportable one working

288
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,870
with you bringing in whoever we need to

289
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,429
be able to help you with your response

290
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,549
in those first very critical few days

291
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:10,179
we've built a dedicated team around

292
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,700
breach reporting and we'll be extending

293
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,620
the hours of our office to manage

294
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,799
reporting under both the gdpr but also

295
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:25,510
the MS directive when I accepted the

296
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,460
role of information commissioner of the

297
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,350
UK I expected challenged enough to bring

298
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,370
in the new data protection laws and

299
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,190
representing the ICO at the article 29

300
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,730
working party as it morphs into the

301
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,659
European Data Protection Board what I

302
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,590
hadn't anticipated was the result of the

303
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:57,010
referendum on June 23rd 2016 and the

304
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,220
referendum results impact on our legal

305
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,640
and policy relationship with Europe has

306
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,940
occupied much of the time that I have

307
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,210
been commissioner as commissioner one of

308
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,409
the most important jobs that I do is the

309
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:19,120
independently advised government and

310
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,070
Parliament on law reform that ensures

311
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,250
high standards of data protection for UK

312
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,890
citizens and consumers no matter where

313
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,909
their data is processed uninterrupted

314
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:37,899
data flows to Europe and the rest of the

315
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:42,850
world and legal certainty for business

316
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,520
and law enforcement government has

317
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,220
explicitly said that it values data

318
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,730
protection as fundamental to the digital

319
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,050
economy

320
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,520
and security cooperation data protection

321
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,210
is a priority area for the brexit

322
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,220
settlement right now and these are the

323
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,660
questions I get all the time are you

324
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,600
still sitting on article 29 right now

325
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,950
the ICO is playing a full role in EU

326
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,390
institutions article 29 Europol euro

327
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,230
just and we're fully immersed in

328
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,150
creating guidance for the GDP are the

329
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,450
ICO is also preparing for the post

330
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,750
brexit environment in order to ensure

331
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,080
that the information rights of UK

332
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,990
citizens are not adversely affected

333
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,770
unfortunately the most significant

334
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,100
unknown from my point of view is the

335
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,770
exact nature of the relationship that we

336
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,470
will have with our DPA colleagues across

337
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,750
Europe during two recent speeches the

338
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,270
Prime Minister has made the case for an

339
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,620
ongoing role for the ICO whether that's

340
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,560
a seat at the table of the European Data

341
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,720
Protection Board with voting rights or

342
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
some other form of relationship that is

343
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,600
acceptable to the UK and the EU the ICO

344
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,740
is deeply embedded and committed to the

345
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,390
EU regulatory community and that's the

346
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,860
message that I've been giving to

347
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,530
parliamentarians when I give evidence to

348
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,230
committees looking at the implications

349
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,260
of brexit so the government has thus

350
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,810
thus far made good on its commitments to

351
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,670
fully implement the gdpr and it clearly

352
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,490
accepts the importance of high standards

353
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,790
of data protection I think the

354
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,220
government should be commended for their

355
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,620
commitment and their effort in this

356
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,000
river

357
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,179
and through our expert advice to the

358
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,490
government and through our strong

359
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,320
engagement with the article 29 working

360
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,429
party we are striving to ensure that the

361
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,520
priorities that I identified become a

362
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,690
reality that's heavy

363
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,700
so further to our focus at this

364
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,210
conference let's step back for a moment

365
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,510
and remember why we're all doing this

366
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,200
it's about people and it's about

367
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,580
increasing the public's trust in

368
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,730
confidence in the way that their data is

369
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,230
handled and this is a very high priority

370
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,659
for me it's a very high priority for our

371
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:03,580
office and I know it is for you too I

372
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,559
think that the recent revelations in the

373
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,480
media have fired up the data protection

374
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,429
debate and so they should I think across

375
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,070
the world people are beginning to wake

376
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,590
up to the importance of personal data

377
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,520
and it's up to us it's up to us as

378
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,360
regulator and those that are striving to

379
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,149
comply with the law to keep that fire

380
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,399
burning I think that might be Burning

381
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:37,490
Man I don't know what that is if we if

382
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,169
we fearlessly

383
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,490
and tirelessly apply the principles that

384
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,230
the ICO and the ia pp hold dear then we

385
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,210
can build the public's trust and

386
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,270
confidence because their data matters

387
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,289
there has never been a better time to be

388
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:04,720
in data protection thank you

389
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,670
