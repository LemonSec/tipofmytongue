1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,139
well good evening imagine a world where

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,580
five low resolution images of your face

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,369
can determine with 91% accuracy if

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,029
you're a man

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,099
slightly less if you're a woman whether

6
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,460
you're gay or not and before you say you

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,249
don't care you don't judge and if you

8
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:30,929
were gay you don't care all that stuff

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,400
just remember that there are 10

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,940
countries in the world today where it's

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,720
a crime punishable by death to be gay so

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,360
think about the implications of that

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,050
technology imagine a world where Google

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,390
has a patent on an in-home device that

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,060
can detect whether alcohol is being

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,680
consumed in the house where their

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,570
smoking is going on where the curse

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,940
words are being used what the emotional

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,310
state of the occupants is they do that

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,470
by looking at your facial expression and

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,019
analyzing your voice tone where their

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,459
teeth are being brushed and if so for

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,710
how long and if so whether the water is

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,970
being left to run during the teeth

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,970
brushing and before you say you know

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,409
that's just a great way of helping me

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,800
monitor my kids remember that if they're

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,159
monitoring your kids I'm monitoring you

29
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,920
now I'm sure you get this all the time

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,479
why do I care about privacy I got

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,350
nothing to hide

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,420
I don't care if people see what I buy I

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,670
live this boring life and when people

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,000
say that to me I say to them well the

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,610
point is it's not just about you it's

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,659
about society and I apologize you're a

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,340
group of professionals but I'm just

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,630
gonna go through a couple these examples

39
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,390
cuz I find them interesting so we all

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,229
know about geofencing but there was a

41
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,700
case last year in Massachusetts in April

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,770
2017 has settled with the Massachusetts

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,360
AG and a firm that was putting geo

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,710
fences around reproductive health

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,930
centers around the country and targeting

46
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,580
women not just any women but abortion

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,380
minded women who went into those clinics

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,450
and giving them live chat offers right

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,000
to life live chat offers and no matter

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,439
where you stand on the pro-life

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,389
pro-choice spectrum many people find

52
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,830
that's a pretty invasive use of the

53
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,050
technology in home devices they know for

54
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,650
example where your phones sleep and so

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,390
your phones normally see you and your

56
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,310
partner in one place and all of a sudden

57
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,590
one phone sleeping downstairs and the

58
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,849
algorithm knows before you've told

59
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,230
anybody else in your life that your

60
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,069
relationships in trouble wearables are

61
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,099
we all like to make sure we get our

62
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,709
number of steps in but just remember

63
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,250
speaking of couples they know everything

64
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,579
that you're doing and before you say no

65
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,250
no we my partner I would take our

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,480
fitbit's off before we did anything just

67
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,950
remember by definition they know when

68
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,239
you're wearing them and when you're not

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,370
and when two people take them off

70
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,090
together they know that these people are

71
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,870
not stupid this value this information

72
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,010
has value and by the way it's not

73
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,810
covered by HIPAA autos they know how

74
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,120
much you weigh how fast you drive how

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,459
hard you brake that's a good one for

76
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,139
your risk tolerance and then people are

77
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,569
lending to you when you go to work if

78
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,079
you get fired

79
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,750
voting is for me the most alarming one

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,790
if less than a hundred thousand votes

81
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,099
separated the last two candidates in the

82
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,959
last presidential election in three

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,769
states this is not a boil the ocean

84
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,209
problem this is not a very difficult

85
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,430
problem they're talking about convincing

86
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,919
a relatively tiny fraction of the voters

87
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,470
in a very in a handful of states to

88
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,480
either come out and vote or stay home

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,639
and remember these companies know

90
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,889
everybody intimately they know who's a

91
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:47,519
racist

92
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,470
who's a misogynist who's a homophobe

93
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,060
who's a conspiracy theorist they know

94
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,319
the lazy people in the gullible people

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,389
they have access to the greatest trove

96
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,129
of personal information that's ever been

97
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,629
assembled they have the world's best

98
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,030
data scientists and they have

99
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,949
essentially a frictionless way of

100
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,190
communicating with you this is a trivial

101
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,530
problem it's also power and as I always

102
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,540
say you know Standard Oil was a powerful

103
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,639
corporation but it didn't know

104
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,180
everything about you so that's why I got

105
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,250
involved in 2015 I kind of got

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,150
interested in this and a friend of mine

107
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,250
and I his name is Rick Arnie and he's a

108
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,979
dad at my son's school and so we that

109
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,870
dads together and we started talking

110
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,490
about this decided I decided to do an

111
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,880
initiative

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,520
and after about a year and a half of

113
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,560
research we ended up on these three

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,010
things

115
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,570
transparencies for the right to know

116
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,980
what information has been collected

117
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,180
about you the right to say no control

118
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,890
tell the company's allowing you to tell

119
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,090
the companies to stop selling your

120
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,520
information and then just accountability

121
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,330
please keep my information safe and so

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,070
we spend a year and a half

123
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,870
researching it we spent you know six

124
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,100
months writing it at the end of 2017

125
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,690
everybody says it came together in like

126
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,320
two days

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,090
it's not true we spent six months

128
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,410
writing it we went through multiple

129
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,740
drafts with the Attorney General and

130
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,170
this is what you do you literally it's

131
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,790
not an e thing around he actually put a

132
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,470
hard copy across the desk in Sacramento

133
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,180
that's not my hand that's a couriers

134
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,000
hand but and then that was right before

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,180
Thanksgiving last last last year and

136
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,130
then you wait no no about a month and

137
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,360
you get the what's called the title in

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,190
summary from the Attorney General and

139
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,770
then you're legally allowed to go start

140
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,010
gathering signatures so January this

141
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,540
year we started gathering signatures and

142
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,420
on the left that's the actual petition

143
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,660
that you've got to go get people to sign

144
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,910
now legally we needed three hundred and

145
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,380
sixty six thousand signatures that's a

146
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,480
percentage of the last vote in the last

147
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,080
gubernatorial election we decided to try

148
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,370
to aim for five hundred seventy seven

149
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,020
thousand there's a you want to go over

150
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,200
because there's a random random count

151
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,490
method this is when it started to get a

152
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,340
little more real and not quite so much

153
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,490
kind of fun every week you'd get this

154
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,810
thing from this on the right was a

155
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,390
spreadsheet I would get from the

156
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,440
signature gathering firm you have to

157
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,790
hire a firm you can't do this by

158
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,770
yourself and it would be sort of this

159
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,940
list of how many signatures they'd

160
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,470
gotten and that's literally all I ever

161
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,300
saw I never saw ballots and never saw

162
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,400
you know petitions so you sort of have

163
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,930
to take them on their word and you have

164
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,190
to wire the money once a week now it's

165
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,380
publicly disclosed at that point so

166
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,030
you're starting to get I was trying to

167
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,040
get press and you can get some kind of a

168
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,510
private person I don't really want that

169
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,310
you know the parents in my kids school

170
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,240
kind of wondering what I was doing and

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,740
the other thing is it's just kind of

172
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,170
binary like you're not like getting half

173
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,550
a house you're either this works or it

174
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,449
doesn't this could all just

175
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,120
the you know big waste of time so so

176
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,150
that was sort of not so much fun then

177
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,270
the opposition committee got formed and

178
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,860
this was also not so much fun and you

179
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,080
know I'm I'm not a billionaire and and

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,930
and this was a still kind of when I

181
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,430
think about the list of companies

182
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,900
arrayed against us that was it that was

183
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,879
not not great

184
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,559
my personal low moment came early this

185
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,860
year I'd always thought that what would

186
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,229
happen is a billionaire would come along

187
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,330
and kind of adopt the initiative what

188
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,529
happens in California a lot of the time

189
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,509
as someone comes up an idea they put a

190
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:26,740
ballot measure together and then someone

191
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,969
comes along and says all put the money

192
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,349
and it becomes their initiative soars it

193
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,759
sort of so like the marijuana initiative

194
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,129
that everybody says is Sean Parker's it

195
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,870
was he wasn't the proponent but he gave

196
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,550
all the money and it became his so I

197
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,460
thought that's what would happen and I

198
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,060
actively tried to pursue that and so I

199
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,960
you know the Bayer had being what it is

200
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,669
I called someone and you know finally

201
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,020
got ahold of somebody and got an

202
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,729
appointment and went is he a very

203
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,180
wealthy billionaire not Sean Parker and

204
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,889
I had my little meeting and I gave my

205
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,539
pitch and at the end of it he was like

206
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,289
this is great and I never forget what he

207
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,189
said he said you're gonna be proud of

208
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,599
for the rest of your life you did this

209
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,819
and I thought great this is going well

210
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,009
and I said so you know will you support

211
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,310
me and he looked at me as like oh I

212
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,909
couldn't support you why and you say

213
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,899
well these companies are really powerful

214
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,649
they could really hurt my business and I

215
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,659
thought your business and then he looks

216
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,279
at me on cue and he says how's your

217
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,180
business doing Elster and I and I looked

218
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,969
at him I said how should it be doing and

219
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,459
he said you know these companies are not

220
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,349
run by nice people

221
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,729
he used a little more colorful phrase

222
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,089
than that and I on the way down the

223
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,539
elevator from that meeting I remember I

224
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,620
literally I kind of wanted to throw up I

225
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,880
just thought what have I done to my life

226
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,589
I had this idea and it was a good idea

227
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,019
and I'm a tiny little businessperson and

228
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,660
there's a little thought exercise here

229
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,480
if you're a business person how many

230
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,579
other businesses can unilaterally put

231
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,199
you out of business let's say you need

232
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,569
customers coming in the door so the

233
00:08:58,569 --> 00:08:59,860
utility could but

234
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,329
can't really because you can go the

235
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:02,829
regulator and say he turned my gas back

236
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,029
on or turn my electricity back on

237
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,620
they're there they're targeting me

238
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,029
because they don't like my political

239
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,000
stance but there's one business who can

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,730
do that and there's no fingerprints

241
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,760
right so that kind of freaked me out I

242
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,170
didn't think it would happen I think we

243
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,490
have the free press I think you know any

244
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,620
these big search businesses or social

245
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,779
media companies would not do that but it

246
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,720
still is a possibility so I stopped

247
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,500
sleeping for the next couple of months

248
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,040
this happened and you know it wasn't

249
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
good for the people whose data was

250
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
leaked but at the same time it stopped

251
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,589
people asking me what I was doing with

252
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:39,970
my life people kind of like oh I get it

253
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,700
now and so we got our signatures in May

254
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,410
and California has a process where it's

255
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,850
a relatively new process didn't used to

256
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,160
be like this where if you a proponent

257
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,190
like me you can get your signatures but

258
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,829
you have a time until when you can

259
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,980
actually withdraw your ballot so for me

260
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,420
is a statutory time based on when your

261
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,899
ballot qualified but so for me it was

262
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,570
June 28th at 5:00 p.m.

263
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,959
and up till then I could withdraw the

264
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,339
ballot now presumably the reason they do

265
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:17,320
this this law is that the Legislature

266
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,720
will stent to step in pass a law and

267
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,029
convince the proponent to withdraw their

268
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,860
ballot the idea being that then you get

269
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,600
one more expensive ballot fight off the

270
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,920
ballot and people don't hate the

271
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,089
legislature as much so I started getting

272
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,029
calls from the legislature and this on

273
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,320
the left hand slide they're the person

274
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,209
on the left is Assemblymember Chao but

275
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,920
behind him his glasses on his head

276
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,839
that's Senator Bob Hertzberg and if any

277
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,279
of you know him he's a force of nature

278
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,990
he this is the craziest small world

279
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,970
story he knew my college roommate and my

280
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,120
best man just because he used to go on

281
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,890
some business retreat weekend with the

282
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,470
guy so I guess he you know called me to

283
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,310
call and figured out that I was

284
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,899
reasonable person so he starts calling

285
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,820
me and that was May I didn't honestly

286
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,610
think very much of it because the first

287
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,350
couple of conversations didn't really go

288
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,180
anywhere and I've got a couple of drafts

289
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,319
and they were sort of meaningless and

290
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,550
they didn't have any enforcement they

291
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,170
had no not

292
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,019
just sort of like words on paper so I

293
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,850
was of course as the senator turns calls

294
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,970
it was flight but but I got to know him

295
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,589
a little bit and he's a good guy

296
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,070
and so a week before the deadline eight

297
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,040
days before the deadline on Wednesday

298
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,120
before the Thursday deadline that's not

299
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,380
okay this is crazy if we're gonna do

300
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,260
this listen please try and I went to

301
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,690
that office in the middle picture

302
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,310
full disclosure that's a totally fake

303
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,269
picture we took it last week but but I

304
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,500
did sit in that seat and that's my

305
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,089
attorney right there James Harrison who

306
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,010
sat beside me so other than those shirts

307
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,600
it's probably the same expressions on

308
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,699
our face and we sat there for 10 hours

309
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,980
on a Wednesday going back and forth with

310
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,820
Sacramento talking and we basically came

311
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,980
up with a deal where we took away

312
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,449
certain things but we got certain things

313
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:01,769
we got the right to see all your

314
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:02,970
information we got the right to Felicia

315
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,720
and we got the right to changed it's a

316
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,459
kid opt-in from 13 to 16 and then we

317
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,029
pared back the writer private action so

318
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,070
that was Thursday when we spent a

319
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,690
weekend negotiating it was a crazy

320
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,300
weekend up till all hours with you know

321
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,190
different elected members on the phone

322
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,440
it was but on Monday morning on the 25th

323
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,010
we had a deal that tech would accept

324
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,390
that was always there was Technol one

325
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,430
side these guys in the middle and us on

326
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,019
the other

327
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,040
at which point my wife kicked me on the

328
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,240
house and said go to Sacramento you've

329
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,019
been working this for two and a half

330
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,360
years don't come back without a vote you

331
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,730
know a positive vote so I went up there

332
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,019
and I walked up and down the halls and

333
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,190
just kind of walked into offices and

334
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,410
said hey this is who I am I think you

335
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,420
should vote for this deal and that's an

336
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,010
on the right-hand side that's the night

337
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,510
before the vote and that's us code

338
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,610
counting just hoping that we had enough

339
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:00,690
votes so the next day is June 28th our

340
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,000
deadlines 5:00 p.m. to withdraw or not

341
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
but actually we had less than that

342
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,600
because we'd heard from the governor

343
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,149
that he was leaving for a fundraiser at

344
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,269
2:30 and Jerry doesn't you know he

345
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,399
marches to his own drummer he wasn't he

346
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,470
sent no messages that he was going to

347
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,510
stick around for this so we knew okay

348
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,920
that's 2:30 and then because the law

349
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,819
hadn't been agreed to

350
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,559
our deal hadn't been agreed to till

351
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,529
Monday morning there's a there's a rule

352
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,059
in California you can't vote on a bill

353
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,639
until it's been in print for 72 hours so

354
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,589
legally we couldn't actually start but

355
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:38,699
they couldn't start debating it on the

356
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,119
floor of the Senate until 10:40 7:00

357
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,109
so we had this little window to get this

358
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:45,089
thing done so on the left is a picture

359
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,470
that's Rick Renee was telling about he's

360
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,389
a fellow who helped me all the way

361
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,549
through and that's my wife and I and

362
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:53,039
then the middle picture is my wife and I

363
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,649
and some of you may know him Ashkan

364
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,689
Soltani he's a former chief technologist

365
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:00,119
at the FTC and he helped us all the way

366
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,039
through with a technological side of

367
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,410
things and on the right very small is

368
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,629
Bob Hertzberg waiting around on a Senate

369
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:10,289
floor for the time to go so we can

370
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,299
introduce this and of course 10:47 comes

371
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,129
along and we're nowhere near it because

372
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,539
we're in the middle of this huge fight

373
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:16,949
between the Republicans and the

374
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,049
Democrats over some soda tax and I mean

375
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,720
it was epic the Republicans storm off

376
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,850
the floor they call emergency caucuses

377
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,799
there everybody's texting me being like

378
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,179
we've never seen this before I mean

379
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,919
they're just hurling insults at each

380
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,139
other on the floor like you know madam

381
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,129
Speaker I've never seen anything like

382
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,039
this in all my years so I think okay

383
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,409
this is not going well and I don't

384
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,419
actually think they took it up till noon

385
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,819
so at this point I think I mean I you

386
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,169
know I I didn't know what's the thing

387
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:45,659
and then I will say when government does

388
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,879
act it acted quickly and the next thing

389
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,409
that happened which I had never really

390
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:55,139
expected if this works there we go is it

391
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,259
passed unanimously out of both houses

392
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,959
which I had not really expected to see

393
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,859
and it was kind of one of those moments

394
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,029
that we sort of send chills down your

395
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:04,919
spine as you watch the boat you know

396
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,869
read the name I and then after that we

397
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,919
went down to the governor's office and

398
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,689
went in and asked if we could watch him

399
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,029
sign ish and they looked at us knows the

400
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:18,959
actual were nice and they were like

401
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,790
we'll go ask like

402
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,449
they came back like now

403
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,680
so anyway went then we went back

404
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,020
upstairs and there's Chow in his office

405
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,000
finding out that was me I was sitting on

406
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
some stairs trying to write something

407
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,670
for the press conference but I realized

408
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,620
I hadn't done that and I was there when

409
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,930
the when the governor's office called me

410
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,910
to say that he'd signed it and that was

411
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,860
a moment I won't forget that's a real

412
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,010
picture my wife took that picture and on

413
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,510
the right with Hertzberg and you know

414
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,770
when that passed and realizing that you

415
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,970
know 40 million people wanted 8

416
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,980
Americans had had protections that they

417
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,870
hadn't had before that was a I was a

418
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,340
moment that I won't soon forget either

419
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,560
so the thing about this journey is it's

420
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,050
it's I feel I still feel very privileged

421
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,510
and and grateful to have taken and it's

422
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,060
an amazing journey and I'm still blown

423
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,770
away about how much power this country

424
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,610
is willing to give its citizens

425
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,780
you know it's an only in America story

426
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,970
and for those of you who are depressed

427
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,380
about the current state of affairs just

428
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,480
think - this summer in Sacramento when

429
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,510
the two sides came together and acted as

430
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,640
one and I you know the cynical side of

431
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,530
view says well they did it so they come

432
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,140
back next spring and got the law but I'm

433
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,600
an optimist and I tend to think it's

434
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,840
because they recognized that privacy is

435
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,290
not partisan and this is a moment in

436
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,580
time they wanted to not be on the wrong

437
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,680
side of history and this leads me I want

438
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,960
to just talk about two things privacy

439
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,900
and prosperity and closing the first

440
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,030
thing is that I think our great

441
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,310
experiment is still alive and well and

442
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,849
by that of course I mean democracy

443
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,190
because democracy is not the human

444
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,200
history it's not the norm right the norm

445
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,430
is power going to individuals and

446
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,000
dynasties and our democracy depends on

447
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,339
all of us every day trying to build it

448
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,260
and one of those essential building

449
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,890
blocks is privacy

450
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,990
without privacy there really isn't any

451
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,179
democracy and it's so essential that our

452
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,700
founders recognize this and so the right

453
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,440
to be left alone in your home and to

454
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,440
keep your papers to yourself and keep

455
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,760
your opinions and your thoughts and even

456
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,190
the right to keep what you know you've

457
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,890
done to yourself all those rights are

458
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,780
enshrined in the Bill of Rights because

459
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,070
again without that there isn't any

460
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,090
democracy but also without prosperity

461
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,770
there's no democracy we all know that

462
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,360
given the choice between food and

463
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,040
freedom we know where everybody's gonna

464
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,230
vote so you have these two things

465
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,419
prosperity and privacy the things that

466
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,950
be kind of me driving me quite crazy

467
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,440
recently is that somehow there's this

468
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,720
emerge this narrative that they're not

469
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,850
compatible that you got to have privacy

470
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,890
you gotta have prosperity and if you

471
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,970
have too much privacy I mean how many

472
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,100
times that people told me don't kill the

473
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,220
innovation engine of America we know

474
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,730
best

475
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,169
don't let the civilians come in don't I

476
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,610
don't let the government people come in

477
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,630
because they're gonna ruin our business

478
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,520
just leave us alone we're really smart

479
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,960
computer scientists and we know how to

480
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,240
do this and this is much too complicated

481
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,080
for you well I'm here to say I'm not a

482
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,020
buyer of that narrative I'm a

483
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,980
businessperson

484
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,840
I feel like I'm as Pro commerce as they

485
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,410
come and I just don't see how good

486
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,940
privacy isn't good business I think it

487
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,890
is good business and I think so the

488
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,030
companies that get it will do well

489
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,890
because I think there's a sea change

490
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,470
going on and I think this is where you

491
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,679
all come in you've chosen to devote your

492
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,580
lives to this area and on your shoulders

493
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,679
rests making sure that this essential

494
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,850
building block of democracy stays intact

495
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,990
so when you go back to work next week

496
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,040
remember it's not just a job

497
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,020
and when the complaints roll in about

498
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,000
you being a cost center or about the

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,620
fact that you know it's hard to comply

500
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,770
with these laws push back ask these

501
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,799
people what kind of a society they want

502
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,270
to live in what kind of a society they

503
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,140
want to leave for their kids because

504
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,220
remember you're not just working for

505
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,250
your company companies come and go but

506
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,070
you have an amazing responsibili

507
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,160
so much rests on your shoulders and I

508
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,510
just want to remind you it's not just a

509
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,160
job because if you're protecting privacy

510
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,650
you're protecting democracy if you're a

511
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,300
guardian of privacy you're a guardian of

512
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,030
democracy and that is the worthy estas

513
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,890
thank you so much
