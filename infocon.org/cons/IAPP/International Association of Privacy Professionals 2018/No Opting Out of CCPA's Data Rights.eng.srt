been doing primarily gdpr

82
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,989
presently moving heavily into CCPA prior

83
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,660
to joining to white I was she privacy

84
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,150

85
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,790
to that and have been in privacy since

86
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,819
about 2003 prior to that was a

87

healthcare CIO and spent 24 years in the

88
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,680
Navy so we've watched the world of

89
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,840
privacy evolve and this is a

90
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,239
continuation of that of evolution as

91
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,209

92
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,220
and I look forward to providing my

93
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,549
section of the presentation today

and with that let's go ahead and get

96
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,630
started with the program and for that

97
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,769
I'm going to hand it off to Deborah

98
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,130
Deborah the floor is yours

99
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,599
wonderful thank you so we see CPA we've

100
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,120
got a new privacy sheriff in town right

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,790
compared to in the past where we've had

102
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,359
other regulators some of them sectoral

103
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,480
in the u.s. some of them global and

104
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,510
regional but in other countries here

105
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,150
we've got something that's very GDP our

106
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,680
life happening in the United States

107
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,010
there are new consumer data protection

108
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,890
rights and with data protection rights

109
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,350
that becomes obligations that for

110
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,850
companies so there's this consumers in

111
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,680
California or residents of California

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,250
have a right to know information that a

113
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,040
company is collect a personal

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,270
information that a company is collecting

115
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,700
about them right to access that

116
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,580
information a right to disclosure a

117
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,400
right to opt-out of sale of that

118
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,380
information and a right to have their

119
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,030
information deleted I'm going to go

120
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,950
through these briefly in the following

121
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,970
slides but what I want to you know for

122
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,530
each of these points here what I want

123
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,050
you to take away is that each of these

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,260
rights has obligations on the company so

125
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,470
now an organization needs to establish

126
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,110
and build and maintain a data inventory

127
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,630
in order to effectuate any of these

128
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,270
rights within the CCPA is an expanded

129
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,070
definition within the united states of

130
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,470
personal information it's very similar

131
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,950
to the GDP our definition and we'll

132
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,200
unpack that but personal information is

133
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,410
data that's linked or label to a

134
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,810
California consumer or household not

135
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,090
just identifiable or personally

136
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,080
identifiable information which most

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,190
[Music]

138
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,510
privacy laws in the United States had

139
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,280
had referred to in the past the world

140
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,450
will unpack what personal information

141
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,570
means and in the following fun

142
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,520
and so this establishes and you need to

143
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,500
determine and monitor the

144
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,610
identifiability

145
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,190
of all the data that an organization has

146
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,880
collected in addition there's actual

147
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,190
real enforcement here that this law has

148
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,480
teeth there are state attorney general

149
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,750
fine or violations and data breach

150
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,560
notification lapses per incident

151
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,610
beginning July 1st 2020 and even earlier

152
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,350
six months earlier from that is when

153
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,020
California consumers have the ability to

154
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,640
sue they have a private right of action

155
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,390
to see for privacy violations and

156
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,680
inadequate protection against breaches

157
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
so

158
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,900
that's coming up quickly January 1st

159
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,370
2020 and then lastly you know there

160
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,720
needs to be accountability and data

161
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,479
processing you know as we'll go through

162
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
this you'll see that it you need to

163
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
operationalize opt-out decisions and

164
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,320
then delineate between what information

165
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,419
is sold transferred and and just

166
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,620
generally process data

167
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,160
the first the right to know the CCPA

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,620
grants consumers the right to request

169
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,750
that businesses disclose the categories

170
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,190
and specific pieces of personal

171
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,600
information in the business have

172
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,590
collected about them so again with the

173
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,540
right to know comes a company's

174
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,180
obligation to disclose and you know

175
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,170
consumer has the ability to send a

176
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,030
request to say I'd like to know all the

177
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,050
information that he sent about me that

178
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,930
verifiable consumer request means that a

179
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,150
business must put processes in place to

180
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,770
be able to you know discuss what

181
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,420
categories of personal information that

182
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,000
is collected about him or her the

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,700
categories of the sources from which the

184
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,330
personal information was collected the

185
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,150
business purposes behind collecting that

186
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,910
personal information the categories of

187
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,880
third parties within the businesses has

188
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,740
shared that information and then the

189
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,630
specific pieces of personal information

190
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,050
and collected about the consumer so for

191
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,000
compliance it like information must be

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
updated at least every 12 months and

193
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,110
what that practically means is then when

194
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,060
this law goes into effect that I'm you

195
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,760
know January well when it goes into

196
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,730
effect would be regulators as of July

197
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,230
1st 2020 will say you know you you must

198
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,230
be able to upon when a consumer comes to

199
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,140
you with a request to exercise a right

200
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,840
to know request that you must have a

201
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,360
look that period of 12 months where

202
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,130
you're able to provide all that data

203
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,169
from the preceding 12 months that that

204
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,080
has been you know kept up to date in

205
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,330
your systems and so what that

206
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,740
practically means is that you don't have

207
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,090
that much time to get your house in

208
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,950
order to be able to provide this

209
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,320
information for this 12 month look-back

210
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,800
period in addition you know any

211
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,370
additional secondary uses of personal

212
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,220
data that are different from from which

213
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,550
you originally told them that you were

214
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,290
going to use the data at the point of

215
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,970
collecting that information and within

216
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,410
your privacy policy at the

217
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,470
collection you know you would now need

218
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,560
to provide notice to the consumer of

219
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,940
their rights and their right to know and

220
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,990
their right to you know request

221
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,910
information about them so you'll also

222
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,310
have to part of the right to know update

223
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,259
your privacy policies to explain the

224
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:30,379
rights of the individual or near this

225
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,519
meeting today um in addition there's a

226
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,800
right to access so in those consumer

227
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,170
requests you know kind of flows from the

228
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,160
previous slide but consumer requests a

229
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,339
copy of the specific personal

230
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,870
information that businesses retain about

231
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,269
him or her so the right to access isn't

232
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,069
just one of the categories

233
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,449
now it's okay you've got these

234
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:58,339
categories I'd like to know what

235
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,350
specific data you you hold about me

236
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,560
so the good thing is that you you know

237
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,910
consumers are only 11 if this request

238
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,639
twice in a year so it's not like they

239
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,230
can fill you with denial of service

240
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,040
attack level of request constantly

241
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,839
coming in over and over and over again

242
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,029
they're only allowed to legally you know

243
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,699
make these requests you know twice a

244
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,310
year however practically that means that

245
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,779
you'll need to have processes in place

246
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,630
to govern those requests to make sure

247
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,690
that those that the right to access is

248
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,610
being is actionable and so that you can

249
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,980
comply with the regulations businesses

250
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,990
must provide a California consumer with

251
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,579
access to personal information that's

252
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,440
held by the business and deliver it to

253
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,740
in a readily usable format that allows

254
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,360
porting the data to another entity

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,319
without vendors and so the what this

256
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,360
really is here within the right to

257
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,759
access there is this kind of implied

258
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,470
right to portability that's similar to

259
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,769
GE PR that allows me it allows you to be

260
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,420
able to receive that data in a way

261
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,449
that's readily usable that you can bring

262
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,949
and pour it over to another organization

263
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:15,660
information must be provided free of

264
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,290
charge

265
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,600
yeah that's pretty clear you can't

266
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,310
charge exorbitant fees to you know

267
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,600
deflate the cost of providing this

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,430
governance in the first place and Andy's

269
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,550
right there is an exception to that

270
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,040
right that your it's not applicable to

271
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,329
information that's collected for a

272
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,490
single transaction as long as the

273
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,920
information is not sold or retain for

274
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,870
the purpose of linking it to personal

275
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,000
information so for instance a great

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,920
example of this is a guest checkout

277
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,670
capability right you want to let's see I

278
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,100
want I don't want to login to a an

279
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,870
e-commerce company

280
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,199
I just want to one-time buy buy

281
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,519
something for it maybe it's a baby

282
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,870
registry and I don't have children so I

283
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,459
never really need to go back to this

284
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,380
particular website but I do want to buy

285
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,139
something in that one moment in time so

286
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,389
because I've never logged in I'm never

287
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,760
really maybe I'm never not fully

288
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,660
identified

289
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,650
I the business and it's just a one-time

290
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,140
transaction there's no need under the

291
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,840
law to maintain a record of that

292
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,060
particular transaction where they

293
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,420
couldn't identify me in the first place

294
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,860
what's also interesting to note about

295
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,170
the right to access is that unlike the

296
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,800
GDP RR there isn't a right to amend your

297
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,130
data if it's incorrect or right to you

298
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,810
know write of rectification which means

299
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,000
pretty much the right to amend your data

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,140
but that's what it's referred to in GPR

301
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,700
yeah it's not such a big deal since you

302
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,260
know one would assume it with all the

303
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,090
other requirements that a company has to

304
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,290
adhere to that you're not you know it

305
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,170
you wouldn't want to keep incorrect

306
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,120
information because you know Clint the

307
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,400
consumer would just leave and wouldn't

308
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,320
trust you anymore so the if you have to

309
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,850
provide the access and the ability to

310
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,980
delete the data in the first place you

311
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,900
might as well give incentivize people to

312
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,380
to you know be able to amend incorrect

313
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,990
data so that they don't request to have

314
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,850
it deleted to instill that trust but it

315
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,410
is it is important to note that that's

316
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,670
not a separate right under CPK um the

317
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,640
right to access also has so we talked

318
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,510
about the inside right of portability so

319
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,010
a business must provide a California

320
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,420
consumer with access to personal

321
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,280
information that's held by the business

322
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,710
and to obtain it in a readily usable

323
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,110
format that allows porting the data to

324
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,300
another entity the time traders without

325
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,410
hindrance so you can't spend you know

326
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,940
months and months this needs to be

327
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,130
something that's done without delay and

328
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,930
and you know without hindrances kind of

329
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,490
a legal term and that would be

330
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,180
determined by by other factors such as

331
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,130
case law and perhaps clarification from

332
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,280
the attorney attorney general and future

333
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,630
they make this request to business

334
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,670
emergent right here okay we already went

335
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,630
over that and the business was not

336
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,240
required to include data that are

337
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,960
obtained in a one-time transaction or

338
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,160
this was kind of flowing from the other

339
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
slide is a little redundant but they're

340
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,570
also not required to re-identify or link

341
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,100
information that is not already an

342
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,110
identifiable form so you know the big

343
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,260
takeaway is here that you know prepare

344
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,760
don't panic if you've already been

345
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,550
working on gdpr compliance you've gotten

346
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,370
a lot of the way there in terms of

347
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,080
operationalizing and data protection

348
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,900
right within your enterprise because it

349
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,680
was really where we need the privacy

350
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,670
office the attorneys the policy folks

351
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,500
within the organization to work hand and

352
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,550
hand with the more technical folks in

353
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,740
the organization to you make your

354
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,240
private engineers or your IT team to

355
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,730
make all the required governance changes

356
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,090
and you know basically to operations you

357
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,010
to make sure you have the capabilities

358
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,960
on our opt-outs the ability to address

359
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,970
the access and deletion request that

360
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,130
scale and with minimal impact to the

361
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,760
business and to collect the so I can

362
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
operationalize all off that request for

363
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,690
the sales consumers so one of the things

364
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,610
I didn't have a slide key but I was like

365
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,930
because out here is that for that

366
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,240
consumers have the right to opt out of

367
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,150
the sale of consumers personal

368
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,730
information and so as part of that it's

369
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,530
similar to GDP ours right to withdraw

370
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,900
consent except that it only applies to

371
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,420
the sale of information you don't have a

372
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,130
right to opt out of all things with

373
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,320
under CCPA but what you do for the sale

374
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,720
of consumer information so let's unpack

375
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,960
that a little bit when an organization

376
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,570
size rents or stones personal

377
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,250
information of other companies the Act

378
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,020
requires them to keep a record of all

379
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,960
sales for 12 months and to provide a

380
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,910
clear and conspicuous link on its

381
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,490
website with the call to action do not

382
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,140
sell my personal information

383
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,329
so that people may easily opt out of

384
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,610
that practice if they want to and then

385
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,100
CS requires even more of those that sell

386
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,660
the personal information of children who

387
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,390
are 16 years old or younger and then

388
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,829
this link or button you know other you

389
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,200
know permission requests that that you

390
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,529
kind of baked into your user experience

391
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,110
which surely you raised privacy concerns

392
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,140
for many potential clients and prospects

393
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,930
and that could you know result in a loss

394
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,240
of their trust so as you would imagine

395
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,899
as the passage of CCPA is kind of

396
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,179
shining a light on the practice ism

397
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,720
data brokers and advertisers you know

398
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,470
there's there's going to be a great many

399
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,059
California consumers that will make

400
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,829
request that their data and not be sold

401
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,530
and then maybe reevaluate the business

402
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,040
model or I should say company should

403
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,490
really Eights their business model now

404
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,740
prepare and implement changes before the

405
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,210
2020 enforcement date because the act

406
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,880
appears to also undercut our current

407
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,460
self regulatory advertising framework in

408
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,890
the u.s. there aren't laws in the United

409
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,630
States that really regulate advertising

410
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,110
and privacy so much as it was a self

411
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,600
regulatory model and now the California

412
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,860
law is kind of appending that and so

413
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,960
it'll it'll be interesting to watch how

414
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,790
the industry practices are going to as

415
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,169
almost like you know right now you also

416
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,900
meet under CCP a you are allowed to

417
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,179
collect affirmative operations from

418
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,970
children between the ages of 13 of 16 to

419
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,740
sell their personal information so now

420
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,390
you also have to manage they're off in

421
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,350
which are have the legal hurdle of

422
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,640
having to the affirmative authorization

423
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,100
so you know basically under the ass a

424
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,870
covered business shall not sell the

425
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,360
personal information of consumers if the

426
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,100
business has actual knowledge that the

427
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,350
consumer is under the age of 16 years of

428
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,680
age

429
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,540
affirmative authorization of the sale of

430
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,020
personal information has been granted

431
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,020
and so you know similar to Coppa the

432
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,520
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

433
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,410
businesses are required to get opt-in

434
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,610
consent for children under the age of 13

435
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,970
except the CCPA then carves out this

436
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,100
other exception that's very different

437
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,870
from like gdpr right we're children

438
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,150
between the ages of 13 and 16 have this

439
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,300
other kind of ability to affirmatively

440
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,040
authorized a business to sell their

441
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,080
personal information without parental

442
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,520
consent and so to comply with this

443
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,010
provision like companies that sell

444
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,800
personal information or you don't like

445
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,710
data brokers and advertisers must put in

446
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,630
place processes and technology that can

447
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,970
detect whether they capture or infer

448
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,890
infer of the ages of children under 16

449
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,260
years old to even imagine with gaming

450
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,850
companies as well this would be

451
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,170
applicable so next the those companies

452
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,940
will need to decide you know does it

453
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,860
make sense to sell this theater or you

454
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,310
know should we stop doing that

455
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,170
you know from these consumers or should

456
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,220
we implement effective consent

457
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,230
management and auditing process is to

458
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,990
manage often affirmative authorization

459
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,060
to sell personal information so you know

460
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,430
you should start preparing now not panic

461
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,010
understand the regulatory space and then

462
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,260
determine what technologies you're going

463
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,090
to use to help with automating some of

464
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,360
this and after I pass the baton over to

465
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,300
Robert you know I will come back and

466
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,420
talk about big ID and how we address

467
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,150
some of these areas but for now I'm

468
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,690
going to leave you with the deletion

469
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,040
aspect so you have the right to delete

470
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,600
personal information if the business is

471
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,730
not required by law to retain and then

472
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,600
privacy

473
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,670
let's see privacy compliance and CCPA

474
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,280
goes beyond traditional notice and

475
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,760
choice requirements right now as it's

476
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,410
today CCPA is really around the ability

477
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,300
to put control back into the hands of

478
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,250
the consumers around there the data that

479
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,180
they've provided data about them and to

480
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,880
really effectuate be that control

481
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,060
through

482
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,230
opt-ins opt out and you know the data

483
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,180
protection rights granted on your CCPA

484
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,700
and so with that Robert to you thanks a

485
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,580
bunch and appreciate it Deborah a lot of

486
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,630
what Deborah just said lends itself to

487
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,460
my portion of the presentation which is

488
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,270
more operational and operational

489
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,290
considerations so the first thing I

490
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,880
wanted to say is readiness takes a

491
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,180
village as we found what GDP are it's

492
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,820
not just IT it's not just compliance

493
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,790
it's not just legal it's not just

494
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,560
procurement it's not just human

495
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,350
resources but to appropriately to

496
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,770
appropriately approach CCPA

497
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,390
it's got to be an organization with wide

498
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,050
endeavor and with that then the

499
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,730
organization has to make some

500
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,030
foundational decisions are we going to

501
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,480
approach California uniquely are we

502
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,490
going to approach California in

503
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,780
conjunction with our other

504
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,080
jurisdictional requirements and are we

505
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,930
going to approach California as part of

506
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,280
our global program we oftentimes while

507
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,400
dealing with GDP are engagements and we

508
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,950
Deloitte did about 250 of those over the

509
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,100
past couple of years saw that the

510
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,380
companies that were most successful had

511
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,530
a leadership view into the mechanisms of

512
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,290
compliance many times had centralized

513
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,770
funding and in fact it was IT and

514
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,870
technology where the bulk of the spend

515
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,400
was versus operationalization or

516
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,130
administrative type procedures basically

517
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,830
to do this you're going to have to use

518
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,380
it from the perspective of the entire

519
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,720
organization from a resource perspective

520
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,740
both human and financial and where

521
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,810
California goes the rest of the nation

522
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,020
could follow or tends to follow if you

523
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,730
think about it California had the first

524
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,560
data breach law in the country we now

525
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,570
have 50 states with data breach laws

526
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,520
many of which almost verbatim follow

527
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,800
California

528
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,780
corny has the confidentiality of Medical

529
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,970
Information Act and while that is a

530
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,870
carve-out under CCPA the reality is as

531
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,240
other accountants other states have put

532
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,130
in law specifically health information

533
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,080
Texas for example and their health and

534
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,740
safety code 181 so where G where Europe

535
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,050
goes much of the world follows and we

536
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,180
see that that where California goes much

537
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,190
of the u.s. follows and we have to also

538
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,990
take into consideration that our own

539
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,880
federal government is finally appearing

540
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,570
to get serious about a federal law so

541
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,540
you have to take that into account when

542
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,330
you tie it back to California has a

543
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,210
strong history of enforcement in

544
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,080
California Massachusetts Connecticut New

545
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,050
York many of those states are leading

546
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,870
the way in terms of the actions of their

547
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,630
attorneys general and how they take care

548
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,510
of their citizenry and for the record

549
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,780
you know California in this is

550
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,420
extraterritorial much like gdpr is

551
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,430
because the definition of a California

552
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,800
resident defers to the california tax

553
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,440
code which essentially says that if you

554
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,330
pay taxes in the state of california

555
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,670
you're a resident and we're waiting on

556
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,130
clarification for for those types of

557
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,650
questions but in theory there could be a

558
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,120
student at the University of North

559
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,680
Carolina who had a summer job in

560
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,830
California who pays taxes I as a

561
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,040
consultant pay taxes in California so

562
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,900
the definition of a resident is very

563
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,700
wide-ranging and you can't just think

564
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,250
about the borders of California and then

565
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,720
you also have to think about the

566
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,970
assertiveness of how California has

567
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,950
traditionally enforced its regulations

568
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,040
and then lastly as Deborah mentioned a

569
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,200
while ago it has owner US and European

570
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,590
mic requirements we we say that it

571
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,140
brings European GDP our to the United

572
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,540
States and while it's not a hundred

573
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,100
percent GDP are there is a a ven overlap

574
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,620
of the requirements that are common

575
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,870
amongst GDP are and the California CCPA

576
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,970
so if you bring all of this together and

577
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,400
you think about a compliance date of

578
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,470
January 1 of 2020 and you couple the

579
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,950
with from about November 15 to the end

580
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,780
of the year times - and you think about

581
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,640
the summer holiday period and you think

582
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,460
about the folks who are supporting your

583
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,580
business the reality is we're now about

584
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,920
14 months out from the compliance date

585
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
and you have 8 to 9 months a true work

586
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,450
period in order to come into compliance

587
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,210
and if you are with a company who has

588
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,120
not executed a gdpr program on a global

589
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,720
basis we found that many companies in

590
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,420
executing GDP are it took them one and a

591
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,810
half to two years to get fully

592
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,820
defensible and we believe that the same

593
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,470
thing is going to be appropriate for

594
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,510
California the purpose of this slide on

595
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,820
the principle amendments to CCPA is to

596
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,790
say look see CPA was passed in June and

597
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,850
the first set of amendments came out in

598
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,210
September and many of us are looking for

599
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,750
rulemaking clarification and

600
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,310
anticipating that further amendments

601
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,020
will occur to see CPA in 2019 and

602
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,580
rulemaking may not even be completed

603
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,470
until the spring of 2020 however there

604
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,840
are core aspects of CCPA which will

605
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,810
never be changed and in that perspective

606
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,910
you have to think about the holistic

607
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,670
program itself and what the purpose of

608
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,580
the program is and to set forth a good

609
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,940
app good-faith effort to become

610
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,890
definitionally ready or defensible

611
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,650
should you be inspected by a regulator

612
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,360
or should you be questioned by your

613
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,600
consumers and we expect that further

614
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,550
amendments will come down one of the big

615
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,260
ones that's often talked about is

616
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,690
employees our employees consumers or

617
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,930
employees employees are you as a company

618
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,620
going to make a value-based decision to

619
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,510
treat employees differently than

620
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,950
consumers or are you going to treat

621
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,250
everybody the same as California going

622
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,080
to be part of your global program or as

623
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,140
California got to be unique so as you

624
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,480
begin to look at these types of per

625
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,210
Series amendments redefining personal

626
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,120
information expanding hit

627
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,180
exemption reference to

628
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,100
gramm-leach-bliley limitations and

629
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,740
privacy or right of action limits

630
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,970
penalty to 7,500 for each violation so

631
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,800
as we begin to look at intentional or

632
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,450
violations and intentional violations

633
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,520
what's the definition of a violation if

634
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,740
I were to find a large multinational

635
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,470
$2,500 as a single fine that's no big

636
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,190
deal but if you had a breach of 500,000

637
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,030
individuals times $2,500 that's a huge

638
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,950
number so we're beginning to really look

639
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,140
at these numbers and these expectations

640
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:15,100
as for further clarification as we move

641
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,770
into some leading practices as it

642
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,080
relates to CCPA

643
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,180
we're really leveraging our history with

644
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,630
gdpr so the first thing that you need to

645
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,390
do is to think about updating your data

646
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,690
classification program redefining what

647
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,850
personal information is and ensuring

648
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,890
that your policies standards processes

649
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:43,030
technologies all all match as it relates

650
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,960
to that and then secondarily you have to

651
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,270
consider as I referenced earlier

652
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,220
California or the United States where we

653
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,190
see leading practices are one-and-done

654
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,780
the complexity and what we mean by that

655
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,060
is the complexity of operating multiple

656
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,080
privacy programs is significant and

657
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,450
because of that you have to look at how

658
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,520
you're going to govern the actual effort

659
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,040
and how you're going to validate the

660
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,600
things like data destruction data

661
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,700
classification the provision of personal

662
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,820
information all come into play records

663
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,140
of processing activities inventory the

664
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,960
processes procedures and systems so as

665
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,540
an example there is one of the questions

666
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,970
that's on the board is would you

667
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,680
recommend the general approach of

668
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,720
producing categories of third parties

669
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,260
with whom info was shared absolutely you

670
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,910
need to know who you sent that

671
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,040
information to what information

672
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,260
you sent what their destruction policies

673
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,080
are whether they're getting requests for

674
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,200
records of processing or records

675
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,460
requests and how you're going to

676
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,230
interact with them and if you don't have

677
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,930
a full system inventory if you are not

678
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,030
interacting with your agencies of record

679
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,280
you're going to have a major problem now

680
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,590
you can you can break them down into say

681
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,860
this vendor has general personal data

682
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,080
and this vendor might have sensitive

683
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,960
personal data as defined by the EU or

684
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,120
other forms of regulated data such as

685
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,530
Social Security number of

686
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,150
government-issued identifiers bank

687
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,880
account information but the reality is

688
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,700
you need to have core sources of record

689
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,100
and those records need to be updated you

690
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,860
need to have a risk ranking criteria so

691
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,240
that you understand what the

692
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,400
organizational risk is reputationally

693
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,950
and financially you need to look at

694
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,530
human change management this isn't just

695
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,510
IT change management but it's human

696
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,490
capital change management and are you

697
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,810
going to change the culture of the

698
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,420
organization as well as setting up

699
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,510
privacy by design standards now you look

700
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,370
at the law and it doesn't say much of

701
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,710
that but the expectation behind the

702
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,100
verbage that's contained in the law

703
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,080
indicates that much of this is going to

704
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,050
be a requirement and if you're going to

705
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,780
have a privacy program that dovetails

706
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,610
nicely with Europe it's just an

707
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,410
extension the problem is is that many

708
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,690
companies when they did the European GDP

709
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,330
our implementation does not include the

710
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,160
United States or rest of the world so

711
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,350
this work is brand-new and many

712
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,960
companies also may operate only within

713
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,450
the jurisdiction of the US so this is

714
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,220
new so for a lot of companies they're

715
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,540
just getting ready to start out the next

716
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,000
one is Portability and erasure what's

717
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,040
the scope of data for portability in a

718
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,330
ratio what are the retention

719
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,400
requirements there is no easy button

720
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,610
meaning there's no no one button that

721
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,990
you can push and make all of this happen

722
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,630
and while we delight our technology

723
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,930
agnostic companies like big id and

724
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,530
others in the marketplace offer

725
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,030
solutions that can address many of these

726
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,340
or part of these or all of these as

727
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,290
they're going through the process and

728
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,020
those types of solutions become

729
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,720
very important are you going to have a

730
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,640
manual based process are you going to

731
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,830
have a technology based process but

732
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,300
regardless you need to start with

733
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,490
systems of record you need to make sure

734
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,410
that those systems are integrated into

735
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,140
the retention schedule those systems and

736
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,360
what's contained in them need to be

737
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,130
contained within the long-term vision

738
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,410
and strategy of the organization do you

739
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,110
do you consider yourself a data company

740
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,420
do you consider yourself an operating

741
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,010
company do you consider yourself a

742
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,170
marketing company and how does the

743
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,210
records that you keep from a legitimate

744
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,460
business purpose then support the

745
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,560
strategy of the business and which of

746
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,120
those records that you keep from a

747
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,340
legitimate business purpose increase the

748
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,250
risk to the business and you also have

749
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,890
to consider ad hoc responsibilities or

750
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,810
ad hoc responses versus technology

751
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,840
enablement and Deborah indicated some of

752
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,480
that and I just talked about this but we

753
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,310
have seen many companies post gdpr go

754
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,330
live where there was an influx of

755
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,910
requests for information where they were

756
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,070
executing their access rights the

757
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,110
individuals were executing access rights

758
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,720
and it's tailed off so many companies

759
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,690
handled this and are handling this with

760
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,930
a administrative and manual process

761
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,240
other companies in preparation for what

762
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,720
they believe to be a large-scale influx

763
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,060
once the requirements become

764
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,910
better-known are implementing

765
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,770
technologies to address this and it may

766
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,750
be a phase 1 phase 2 approach but the

767
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,250
reality is you have to make that

768
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,030
decision up front and then consent

769
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,700
Deborah talked a lot about consent but

770
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,430
you need to be able to update your

771
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,570
authentication mechanisms how do you

772
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,550
really know that it's in the individual

773
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,470
so we have companies from a gdpr

774
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,770
perspective and other companies that and

775
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,980
I've seen this myself we're just from a

776
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,590
login perspective on a consent on a

777
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,240
customer based website I am getting

778
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,370
multi-factor authentication text into my

779
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,550
might tell my mobile phone in order to

780
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,060
log in to make sure it's really me

781
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,770
Enterprise consent management solutions

782
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,909
we're beginning to see a

783
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:09,549
master data management solutions when

784
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,819
you begin to put in all of these factors

785
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,500
and you have to manage opt-in and

786
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,168
opt-out and you don't have a central

787
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,239
system opt-in opt-out and you have

788
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,129
agencies of record who are working on

789
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,889
your behalf if you do not have a master

790
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,020
data management solution or some sort of

791
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,668
a solution that addresses all the

792
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:29,918
singles all the sources of information

793
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,379
that come in to create a unique

794
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,780
individual then you have risk in your

795
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,299
company and the biggest thing and

796
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,819
Deborah talked about this is you need to

797
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:41,918
know for sure which which data is

798
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,589
actually being sold so the housing of

799
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:46,839
data the utilization for a business

800
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,119
purpose is one thing but what is the

801
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,059
data that's being sold and what forms of

802
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:54,879
data are being sold are they ID

803
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,918
identified are they pseudo anonymized

804
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,089
are they identifiable is it can contain

805
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:02,799
within the consent statement is it

806
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,510
contained within your privacy statement

807
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,480
online these again fall within the

808
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,640
purview of what you need to seriously

809
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,430
consider security so we talked a lot

810
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,400
under gdpr and other laws about security

811
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,339
for privacy and historically states such

812
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,770
as Massachusetts in California have led

813
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,039
the way but as we've watched companies

814
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,339
come through the gdpr process many

815
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,559
companies were looking at ISO from a

816
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,839
European standard we're looking at nist

817
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:37,119
from a u.s. standard and what they're

818
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,279
trying to figure out is what standard do

819
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,500
we follow and what's the best practice

820
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,049
or an industry-leading practice or a a

821
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,779
common practice and what we're beginning

822
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,150
to see are companies who have developed

823
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,640
what I'll call a control framework for

824
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,010
security where they have consolidated

825
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,950
nist and iso into a single controlled

826
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,289
framework along with other similar type

827
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,210
of expectations such as the security

828
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,430
requirements in HIPAA and that's what

829
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,339
they're going with monitoring encryption

830
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,960
tokenization loss prevention

831
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,180
capabilities companies have to make a

832
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,240
basic decision from a risk perspective

833
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,950
where they may have put these off that

834
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,069
now this this impetus and the risk to

835
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:20,190
the company is demanding that these type

836
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,289
technology's be put into place and

837
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,270
that's where the risk versus reward

838
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,339
comes into play and every company we

839
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:28,349
work with has a different risk tolerance

840
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:30,390
some are have a higher tolerance some

841
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,270
have a lower tolerance one of the things

842
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,190
that you have salutely need to do is

843
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,900
look at your incident response plant

844
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,990
your forensic capabilities and and and

845
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,660
conduct wargaming whether it be tabletop

846
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,890
exercises or actual exercises also you

847
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,109
have to make a decision of how you're

848
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,210
going to conduct breach notification if

849
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,010
you have global databases and the

850
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,319
Europeans require notification to a

851
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,730
regulatory authority within 72 hours

852
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,170
whereas this law says you have to make

853
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,920
notification in 30 days are you going to

854
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,859
defer notifying the California Attorney

855
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,630
General or the other appropriate

856
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,119
regulatory agencies for 27 days after

857
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,849
you've notified the Europeans or are you

858
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:17,010
going to notify in the same time frame

859
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,950
so each of these nuances has to be can

860
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,839
look tat in conjunction with your global

861
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,260
footprint and then of course encryption

862
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,940
is a safe harbor under CCP a and and so

863
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,500
what we already have our number of

864
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,730
companies they're just talking about

865
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,500
flipping the encryption key and

866
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,930
encrypting in transit and in storage to

867
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,240
avoid many of the risks that are

868
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,510
associated with breach third-party

869
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,920
inventory and all of your third parties

870
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,099
who process personal data on your behalf

871
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,829
or for whom you receive personal data

872
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:55,650
from do you know for a fact that the

873
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,510
data that you have purchased from that

874
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,279
third party has been procured in

875
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:02,069
accordance with these requirements do

876
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:04,470
you have the contractual obligations do

877
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,029
you know for a fact that your data

878
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:08,250
processes are in fact complying with the

879
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,900
obligations do you know that they are

880
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,960
not using it for their own purposes

881
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,940
which contracts do you need to amend and

882
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,299
we we have seen companies with thousands

883
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,339
of contracts that need to be amended or

884
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,619
to have reference while we were dealing

885
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:23,910
with the gdpr

886
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,549
so which of the contracts are you going

887
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:28,170
to amend and how are you going to

888
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,150
identify them and we actually have a

889
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,589
solution where our artificial

890
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,230
intelligence is being used to

891
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,170
read contracts to assist in identifying

892
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,750
these types of elements and who do you

893
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,580
assess are you going to assess those

894
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,859
vendors that that process the most

895
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,750
sensitive forms of personal information

896
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,820
on your behalf you're going to assess

897
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,920
all vendors or you're going to assess

898
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,880
those vendors that you select randomly

899
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,800
or are you going to put the right to

900
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,960
audit and assess in a contract and then

901
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,150
decide not to execute you have to make

902
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,850
those decisions and breach preparedness

903
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,290
I talked a little bit about that a while

904
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,710
ago but breach preparedness is key and

905
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,330
testing your breach response program is

906
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,990
key understanding the interface between

907
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,109
security and privacy is key technology

908
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:19,290
enablement now or later as well as the

909
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,630
maturity of your privacy landscape which

910
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,190
technologies are you going to implement

911
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,200
implement and how are you going to do

912
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,750
them once your vendor analysis under a

913
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,810
short and a long term strategy

914
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,770
management you know we talked a while

915
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,350
ago and I talked and Deborah indicated

916
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,690
well CCPA be modified will it be further

917
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,200
amendment how is it going to be enforced

918
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,330
we know California historically enforces

919
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,619
pretty seriously

920
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,170
but as CCPA going to be enforced at the

921
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,240
same level a higher level a lower level

922
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,430
and what's my business risk

923
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,710
what's the categories of personal

924
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,359
information do I sell the moment pop

925
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,040
shops are they consumers or do I sell to

926
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,470
individuals and do I interact with

927
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,930
individuals and I'm tracking them from a

928
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,840
purchase habit perspective and what's

929
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,880
the change culture how are you going to

930
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,760
change your organization and how are you

931
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,470
going to manage the employees in your

932
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,750
organization when I was in industry I

933
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,250
often said I was going to give people

934
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,470
bracelets that said what about Bob and

935
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,770
what I mean by that is how does privacy

936
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,230
interact with the business how large is

937
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,060
the privacy office what's the value to

938
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,750
the business

939
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,940
privacy is no longer writing policies

940
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,030
and procedures and just interpreting law

941
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,310
policy privacy really now is part of the

942
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,720
operational culture of an organization

943
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,600
and has to be integrated into the

944
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,550
business and strategy development of the

945
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,920
organization or risk inside the

946
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,320
organization well and continues to

947
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,339
increase

948
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:54,538
as we begin to look at CCPA readiness

949
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,440
you really have to assess and then build

950
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,069
and then operationalize so as you begin

951
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:05,140
to assess you want to look at your

952
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,420
existing documentation your existing

953
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,119
people process technologies your

954
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,460
existing strategies roadmaps and and

955
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,950
project planning and what I mean is this

956
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,460
is strategies and roadmaps not only for

957
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,559
the technology and core business but

958
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,660
strategies and roadmap for your own

959
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,660
privacy office I mentioned during my

960
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,249
introduction that I've watched the

961
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:29,710
professionalism of the professional

962
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,529
nature of privacy be enhanced over the

963
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:36,519
past 15 years for many years I fought to

964
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,170
be recognized as a legitimate

965
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,079
professional and for many years I fought

966
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,509
for privacy to be legitimized as they

967
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:47,469
pry as a true profession gdpr CCPA

968
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:49,839
they are the full employment act for

969
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,519
privacy professionals so it's a great

970
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,979
time to be a privacy geek but if you're

971
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,719
going to do that you have to become part

972
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,190
of the business and the business culture

973
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,739
and the business strategy and then

974
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:01,809
putting together the budget this is

975
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:04,150
where a lot of companies in GDP are

976
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,400
seriously underestimated the complexity

977
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,279
of GDP are and seriously underestimated

978
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,349
the business and if you haven't been I'm

979
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,739
sorry

980
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,950
the complexity and the cost of GDP are

981
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,019
and if you haven't been through that

982
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:19,509
process already for GDP are you're going

983
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:21,279
to need to go through that process for

984
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:21,969
CCPA

985
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:24,700
and the success is often with

986
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,769
centralized budgeting rather than

987
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:29,859
fragmented budgeting and how and how

988
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,109
willing are is your organization to

989
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:34,029
absorb either the risk or the resource

990
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:36,930
needs as you begin to look at phase 2

991
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,210
which is really the design and build

992
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,670
phase you're going to have to look at

993
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,619
planning for the entire program and

994
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:46,539
remember earlier I said something like

995
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,519
there's 8 months left you're going to

996
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:50,289
have to look at your policies and notice

997
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:53,259
how you're going to manage consent and

998
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:54,940
how you're going to manage individual

999
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,640
rights access what's your security for

1000
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,499
privacy what your existing security

1001
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:01,670
posture there were

1002
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,299
in my past life were sis's were my worst

1003
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,990
nightmare now for the first time not for

1004
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,520
the first time over the past few years

1005
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,790
I've seen the cooperation among IT

1006
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,950
security and privacy becomes

1007
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,190
significantly higher than ever before

1008
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,160
and I'm beginning to see many sis's who

1009
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,520
are now asking for direction and

1010
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,869
specifics from the privacy office of

1011
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:29,420
what's the minimum expectation and I'm

1012
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,040
thrilled to see that because there were

1013
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,540
times I had to fight to get that

1014
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,839
attention putting privacy by design into

1015
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,869
play and not only designing it but

1016
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:41,240
executing it and then validating it

1017
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,400
again I talked about human capital

1018
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,530
change management I talked about

1019
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,329
procurement and third-party risk

1020
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:50,510
management organization and the

1021
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,700
operating model are you going to have no

1022
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,170
privacy office are you going to have a

1023
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,450
50% time are you gonna have 12 people

1024
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,910
what's your operating model for privacy

1025
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,980
are you going to use privacy stewards

1026
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,960
throughout the organization are you

1027
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,940
going to dovetail this as part of your

1028
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,490
global privacy program metrics and

1029
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,809
reporting what are they

1030
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,450
Incident Response tests them data

1031
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,180
inventory get it and data protection

1032
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,230
impact assessments documented there's a

1033
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,270
few questions on here I'm going to see

1034
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,950
if any of them real quick can you talk a

1035
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,980
little bit broad about the deletion

1036
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,569
exemption I think I'm going to defer

1037
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:30,200
that a little bit to Deborah

1038
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,180
can you define the scoping of opt-out

1039
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,859
cookies in tracking that's a technology

1040
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:38,960
question I'm going to defer to Deborah

1041
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,839
and then there was a question about are

1042
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,299
there exceptions similar to gdpr for

1043
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:47,270
clinical research having come from a

1044
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,119
pharmaceutical company I would tell you

1045
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,180
that under clinical research you have

1046
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,210
the informed consent the ICS the

1047
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,980
informed consent that all the patients

1048
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,040
and most of those have gone through some

1049
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,410
sort of an IRB an institutional review

1050
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,839
board and that institutional review

1051
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,849
board generally operates clinical

1052
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:10,849
research under HIPAA and I am NOT as an

1053
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:13,299
attorney and I do not provide legal

1054
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:15,230
advice I am a

1055
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,390
so but what I would tell you is I think

1056
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,839
a case can be made that would say that a

1057
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:23,599
clinical trial participant and clinical

1058
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,960
research is not consumer marketing and

1059
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,130
because of the other protections that

1060
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,079
are granted I think clinical research

1061
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,810
could be a limited carve out and that is

1062
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,700
one of the areas that it would expect to

1063
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,880
see that the state would continue to

1064
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,150
address in the future then finally from

1065
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,710
the operationalization and

1066
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,050
implementation Thursday it's not just

1067
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,599
writing policies it's actually ensuring

1068
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,220
that your policies that you put out

1069
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,220
there or followed it's not just saying

1070
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,320
you have a rights management but testing

1071
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,710
and our and putting that into play so

1072
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,240
all of these things that are in phase

1073
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,810
two it's really validating what in Phase

1074
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:05,329
three it's really executing what you've

1075
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,369
designed in Phase two and not only just

1076
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:09,260
putting the policy and procedure out

1077
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,450
there but testing that it actually works

1078
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,160
the way that you expect that the work

1079
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,990
and that people have changed people are

1080
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,010
incorporating that into their day-to-day

1081
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:24,579
business so one way that many of these

1082
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:28,250
programs can be managed is with

1083
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,920
technology and Deborah's going to follow

1084
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,430
on here in just a second that that say

1085
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:37,040
technology can help you do more with

1086
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,000
less and the key here is to say you've

1087
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,819
got 500 data rights requests I'm just

1088
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:46,490
making this up if you had to manually

1089
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,690
execute data rights requests and you got

1090
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,800
500 of them in it would be held to do so

1091
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,230
in that perspective then maybe

1092
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,630
technology can help master data

1093
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,579
management if you have to combine

1094
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:04,310
multiple systems into place in order to

1095
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,790
manage consent or you have to go to look

1096
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,270
at all your third parties and 16 systems

1097
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,160
in house and see if somebody's opted out

1098
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,760
fast complexity so the point here is

1099
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,950
that technology can help you with your

1100
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,079
CCPA programs and can help you leverage

1101
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,960
more with less so data inventories you

1102
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,420
can use technology to do your

1103
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,250
we've seen artificial intelligence we've

1104
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,770
seen ediscovery we've seen data loss

1105
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,240
prevention and we've seen other

1106
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,220
technologies that call the networks to

1107
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,770
do in them force consent management

1108
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,980
master master data management

1109
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,510
individuals can now opt out of sharing

1110
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,609
how are you going to incorporate this

1111
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:49,040
into your program and Deborah indicated

1112
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,670
that earlier individual rights deletion

1113
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,859
access and other data subject rights may

1114
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:57,230
be impractical to execute from a manual

1115
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,660
perspective so can you completely

1116
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,220
process these in an automated fashion

1117
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,200
using your IT systems there are

1118
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,000
technologies out there that can help you

1119
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,470
do that incident response in breach

1120
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:17,030
detection prior to is important but also

1121
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,330
preparation for the potential of can

1122
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,609
help you create more resilient systems

1123
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:26,150
so automated notification requirements

1124
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,980
against characteristics of incident

1125
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,099
allow for expedited workflow and that's

1126
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:32,900
that's not unlike what data loss

1127
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,080
prevention does so as we begin to look

1128
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,540
at how technology can help meet the

1129
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,640
requirements and technology can help you

1130
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,310
implement the program this is a session

1131
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:44,900
that Deborah would like to talk about

1132
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,210
and so I'm going to turn it back over to

1133
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,240
Deborah and then at the end Dave and

1134
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,589
others will make sure that we address

1135
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:53,480
any questions that we've missed so thank

1136
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,570
you once again

1137
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,670
great thanks Robert that was super

1138
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,020
informative about kind of

1139
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,460
comprehensively how companies should

1140
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,800
attack this challenge and it's just to

1141
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,380
build on that or CCPA building blocks or

1142
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,650
you know you need a combination of the

1143
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,310
policies the the the accountability and

1144
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,520
transparency by consumers you also need

1145
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,510
the technology aspect in order to find

1146
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,400
personal data and you want to do this

1147
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,650
not just by search of life the person's

1148
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,180
main and hoping things show up right I

1149
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,550
mean you you need to find context and

1150
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,400
what data is associated with other data

1151
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,170
that makes it personal information right

1152
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,640
because personal information anything

1153
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,050
that's linked are linkable too and ident

1154
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:46,470
and so you know especially for

1155
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,170
enterprises it's very very difficult to

1156
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,380
I don't know delete personal information

1157
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,030
upon on a deletion or request if you

1158
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,510
don't know where all of the linkable

1159
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,400
personal information lives within your

1160
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,300
enterprise so technology T in addition

1161
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,520
you want to map an inventory personal

1162
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,550
information by consumer so you want

1163
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,110
understands where is an individual

1164
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,420
consumers personal information

1165
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,420
throughout your your systems

1166
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,030
specifically and then be able to

1167
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,130
categorize those and then you need

1168
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,840
processes to operationalize and

1169
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,640
fulfilled privacy lifecycle management

1170
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,650
add as deep as outlined by Robert okay

1171
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,340
let's see that didn't so you know I

1172
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,260
think idea addresses this in several

1173
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:40,110
ways first for addresses to address the

1174
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,380
data consumer data right we need like a

1175
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,880
privacy intelligence right you need

1176
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,390
insight into your own data so you can do

1177
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:51,480
this with big I deep through data

1178
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,040
discovery of the personal information

1179
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,400
across your entire environment through

1180
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,160
our machine learning and AI technology

1181
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,260
you can also you know that the

1182
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,369
technology will correlate the personal

1183
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:08,190
data based based on the consumers

1184
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,040
identity and it'll find other data that

1185
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,340
is connected to an identity I mean we do

1186
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,670
this by as Robert says starting with the

1187
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,440
systems of record how do you define when

1188
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,720
my identity is within organization well

1189
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,490
you look at kind of what you consider to

1190
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,350
be the source of identity whether it's a

1191
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,300
combination of you know Salesforce

1192
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,430
information combined with you know some

1193
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,119
other databases and data stores and then

1194
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,420
you know we take that and see our

1195
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,940
machine learning model you know and this

1196
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,800
is an on-premise solution so you're not

1197
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,590
actually it's not fast we're not a data

1198
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,150
processor here something installed

1199
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,910
locally a behind the company's firewall

1200
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:52,760
and it pretty much we scan all of the

1201
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,690
data stores throughout your organization

1202
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,700
through an API first model

1203
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,510
and then find like attribute to the

1204
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,760
identities that you know you've

1205
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,560
considered in their system of identity

1206
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,690
systems of record and then we find

1207
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,430
attributes that are similar and then

1208
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,349
correlate that to an identity index it

1209
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,349
and then classify so that inventory and

1210
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:15,780
index capability is what allows you to

1211
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,730
kind of have that google-like search

1212
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:21,240
within our platform to find personal

1213
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,349
information and then as new data sources

1214
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,329
come on board because you know you're

1215
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:28,589
constantly changing your business

1216
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,680
environments and new applications are

1217
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,170
added I mean attributes are introduced

1218
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,470
you will do you know continued scans

1219
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,839
that are that allows for dynamic data

1220
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,430
maps and that's kind of the image you

1221
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,470
can see up there that you've got a

1222
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,570
personal data inventory with a visual

1223
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,430
data mapping of your business processes

1224
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,000
and how information flows through your

1225
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,970
business process and that also allows

1226
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:57,570
for finding individual you know finding

1227
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,420
things like data residency and oh my

1228
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,089
gosh why is this you know German data

1229
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:05,609
German person's data found all the way

1230
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:13,440
in I don't know in in Africa where it's

1231
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,060
you know shouldn't have left Germany or

1232
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,740
or something along those lines you can

1233
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,170
understand the risk to your information

1234
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,230
with that data insight and 360 degree

1235
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,770
view into your personal information in

1236
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,480
addition you know that we have a

1237
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,520
consumer centric view that's generated

1238
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,260
from the inventory that basically

1239
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,079
provides the basis for privacy

1240
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,359
protection and reporting so you can

1241
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,910
understand where the personal

1242
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,210
information was found what categories of

1243
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,910
data are collected so that was one of

1244
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,829
the questions that was asked how can you

1245
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,720
provide the categories of data that are

1246
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,490
collected well you know first you have

1247
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,260
to discover them and find them and make

1248
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,680
them contextualize how the data is

1249
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,220
related to a consumer so you know that

1250
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,160
the technology has the ability that kind

1251
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,109
of explain how that data has been linked

1252
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:09,270
to an individual down to you know what

1253
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,970
data

1254
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:13,840
or file-share or you know cloud service

1255
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,670
it was it was found in and then you can

1256
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,890
add the justification for collection so

1257
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,140
you know you can add into it you could

1258
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,820
add into this report and you have an

1259
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,670
automatic generated if you know for GDP

1260
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,960
our would be a data subject that's

1261
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,290
request reports and for calculating

1262
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,510
consumer price yes it's just an access

1263
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,770
report right

1264
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,700
you can basically on-demand press the

1265
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,950
press of a button to run B the report

1266
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:44,890
generation and it'll it'll it'll give

1267
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,109
this this view of all of the data

1268
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,820
collect about an individual that you can

1269
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,040
provide back to the individual either

1270
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,930
through your website through a

1271
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:56,010
self-service capability or kick off to a

1272
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,930
you know to the customer service rep who

1273
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,640
who is going to interact with that

1274
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,070
individual verify their identity and

1275
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:06,700
send it back to them um so as we've

1276
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,170
already talked about like you know see

1277
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,750
CPAs is pretty much here to stay

1278
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,300
there's going to be minor tweaks there's

1279
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,220
gonna be amendments still what Chicanos

1280
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,470
Robert describe however they're just

1281
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,300
going to be more tweaked the data

1282
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,950
protection rights afforded to the

1283
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,760
individuals are pretty much the central

1284
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,890
portion of the CPA and they're here to

1285
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,700
stay so you absolutely need ways to use

1286
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,040
technology to correlate opt-out

1287
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,560
decisions to spittoon

1288
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,500
to the specific consumer within the data

1289
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,290
inventory you want to identify consumer

1290
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,900
data and locations and then of course

1291
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,650
identify the specific processing flows

1292
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,270
for the consumer data sets within your

1293
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,339
environment you want identify the

1294
00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:53,619
applications and third parties that are

1295
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:56,740
part of any data flow and then of course

1296
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,839
you want to apply any opt-out policies

1297
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:02,280
that you've had through your your

1298
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,960
consent management capabilities that you

1299
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,270
you already have in place you want to

1300
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,010
apply that to consider your consumer

1301
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:12,570
profile and make sure to have policy tag

1302
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,430
of those attributes and

1303
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,830
and as the big idea clack born allows

1304
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:23,600
for orchestration of the various content

1305
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,030
management software's that you had and

1306
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,410
pulls in that information to our

1307
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,910
discovery capabilities so that you can

1308
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,680
even see when someone's opted in over

1309
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,660
here opted out for a completely

1310
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,670
different service over there and it kind

1311
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,440
of keeps that all in check to provide be

1312
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,520
able to provide that back to the

1313
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,250
consumer when they when they want to

1314
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,480
know why you're processing their

1315
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,340
information or what authority you have

1316
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,490
to do that and then also maintain you

1317
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,230
know your policy based monitoring and

1318
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,940
alerting for continuous compliance

1319
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,370
because you know this is an old one and

1320
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,110
done situation this is gonna now be a

1321
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,660
consistent monitoring and governance

1322
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,970
capability that it will enable your

1323
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,910
organization to continue to comply with

1324
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,870
CCPA down the road the right to be

1325
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,700
forgotten and the right to right through

1326
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,940
a racer you know similarity servers you

1327
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,530
know in under CCP has the right to

1328
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:18,310
delete but here's a good example of a

1329
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,890
request to fulfill that right so you get

1330
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,180
a request to delete someone's personal

1331
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,250
information from their systems might

1332
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,500
come in from you know let's worm mobile

1333
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,200
apps phone call however it comes in then

1334
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,870
you want to authenticate that request

1335
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:38,660
and then validate that the person is who

1336
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,650
they say they are so you're gonna

1337
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:42,710
validate against your inventory and then

1338
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,720
issue a response to the consumer you

1339
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,180
might say yes we are going to provide if

1340
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,190
you are no we don't have any information

1341
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,690
in the first place so you'll respond

1342
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,240
back then even want to generate a list

1343
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,400
of relevant application data sources and

1344
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,070
attribute locations for the consumer

1345
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:01,520
from your inventory and then you know

1346
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,740
here's how you would execute on those

1347
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,720
you know hopefully you have predefined

1348
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,850
workflows already on how you're going to

1349
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,800
shuffle these requests you could

1350
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,240
generate a ticket that you know for

1351
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,160
instance that you're using jira for

1352
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,010
internal ticketing or or any other

1353
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,770
ticketing system you can then you know

1354
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,900
kick off a ticket to the right person

1355
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,230
who's going to internally so you know

1356
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,150
delete the row from the database that

1357
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:29,240
we've identified or you know find that

1358
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,230
information

1359
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,230
in a file share and delete it once we

1360
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:36,020
identify where it's located and then you

1361
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,300
don't initiate that deletion workflow to

1362
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,460
IT and then appropriate application

1363
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,040
owners and then initiate the

1364
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,580
orchestration via API with the ability

1365
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,310
to mask and be identify and encrypt

1366
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,520
right so you might your ability deleting

1367
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,830
might mean mate rendering you know

1368
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:58,359
getting rid of any sort of identity

1369
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,160
identify ability right so you could be

1370
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,900
identified on information and perhaps

1371
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,020
still preserve some value and keeping

1372
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,030
the data but eliminating any

1373
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,930
identifiability ID by encrypting 14d

1374
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,990
identifying and then you know queue up

1375
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,990
which records you want to delete and

1376
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,730
identify what those are then of course

1377
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:22,550
validate that those workflows have been

1378
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,640
effectively completed validate that

1379
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,590
against the inventory with the internal

1380
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,660
consumer access reports right you'll

1381
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,930
generate the report automatically and

1382
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,480
then be able to finally deliver that to

1383
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,280
the report either you know in whatever

1384
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,660
way that you want to deliver it either

1385
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,250
through your websites yourself service

1386
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,070
capability or you know sending it by

1387
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,440
other more and so this is pretty much

1388
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,940
the summary slide here I know we're at

1389
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,160
the very end but I want you to I want to

1390
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,950
leave you with with privacy and that the

1391
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,750
two main things that our platform does

1392
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,790
that I think are just incredibly unique

1393
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,430
in the in the field are our robust

1394
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,530
privacy intelligence that big ID and our

1395
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,440
ability to provide privacy assurance

1396
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,040
with the intelligence technology it's

1397
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,480
you know for large businesses with many

1398
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,820
data stores it's really essential to

1399
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,290
leverage technology it's almost

1400
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,190
impossible to built to act upon the CCPA

1401
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,950
requirements without having a clear

1402
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,359
understanding as to where data lives

1403
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:22,670
across your enterprise you need a map

1404
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,800
the data flows to illustrate you know

1405
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,109
what applications and systems and with

1406
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:30,650
whom is that data shared you need to

1407
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,320
easily contextualize all the personal

1408
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,880
information across the company based on

1409
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,930
an individual's individual

1410
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,270
Zoomers identities and then facilitate

1411
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,220
quick organizational responses to

1412
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,510
consumer access and deletion request

1413
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,579
under the Act you also need to provide

1414
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,920
privacy assurance for auditing purposes

1415
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,470
and defend against lawsuits and

1416
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,260
regulatory actions and so without the

1417
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,270
assistance of identity aware of privacy

1418
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,550
management technology you know I don't

1419
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:59,069
think large organizations would be able

1420
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:00,869
to provide the accurate information

1421
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:03,329
required to respond to the influx of

1422
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:06,300
consumer requests of the act you know

1423
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:10,050
when the act becomes enforceable and so

1424
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,059
with the privacy assurance aspect you

1425
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,460
know we're giving you complete certainty

1426
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,309
to know with a high level of certainty

1427
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:20,430
that high level of certainty poufy tulle

1428
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,800
is where in your enterprise so you know

1429
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,420
this is going to satisfy your auditors

1430
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,150
your data protection officers and all

1431
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,829
the various regulators you know whether

1432
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:32,280
gdpr TCPA or in other countries that are

1433
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,349
promulgated regulations and other states

1434
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:37,829
that may do so as well so you know this

1435
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:39,690
will help you confidently and

1436
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,760
effectively manage consent and then

1437
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,960
integrate and monitor your data

1438
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,890
processing so you know this is pretty

1439
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,180
much the slide we're going to leave I'm

1440
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,410
going to leave you on and we've

1441
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,119
integrated some of the questions into

1442
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,010
our our discussion here as you've been

1443
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:57,450
asking them but let me take a look this

1444
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,880
last one so big I do have the ability to

1445
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,390
delete what about making sure that is

1446
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,549
removed from unallocated space so right

1447
01:02:05,549 --> 01:02:06,240
now

1448
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,630
Big Ideas has only has read-only access

1449
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:13,710
into into your data in the future we

1450
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:17,069
will have some other abilities to take

1451
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:19,950
action to be you know and we'll discuss

1452
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,720
that another time but right now we do

1453
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,849
not have the ability but we do have the

1454
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:26,099
ability to identify what needs to be

1455
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:29,220
deleted down to the database so and that

1456
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,210
you know down to the very very specific

1457
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,890
locations of the data across all of your

1458
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:36,200
data store structured or unstructured

1459
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,559
semi-structured data and so you know in

1460
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,690
the future we will have the ability to

1461
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,790
do some other things another question

1462
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,010
those big IDs have

1463
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,960
joshan capabilities not yes but we're

1464
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,750
working on it and so we will we will get

1465
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,610
back to you on that

1466
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,980
and so these I'm handing this back to

1467
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,130
you now for questions but I think we

1468
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,460
might be out of time yeah exactly Debra

1469
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,200
but as you mentioned just a moment ago

1470
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,330
you I did a terrific job as did Robert

1471
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:09,300
answering the questions in line so we

1472
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,620
had some great questions coming in but

1473
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,240
you can ask you the terrific job and

1474
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,950
just integrating integrated them right

1475
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,230
into the discussion so we are just about

1476
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,570
at a time but as you can see on the

1477
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,940
slide in front of you now both Debra and

1478
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,950
Robert have made their email addresses

1479
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,320
available to you graciously so if you

1480
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,050
have any further questions or a question

1481
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,880
that didn't get answered to your

1482
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,320
satisfaction please do feel free to

1483

1485
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,780
you have anything that you'd like to

reason you're listening to this and you

credits they may or may not be provided

1547
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:55,570
for this program they often are but we

1548
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,120
do not pre certify these programs so

1549
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,040
you'll need to apply within your

1550
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,090
particular bar for those credits and and

1551

1552
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,410
