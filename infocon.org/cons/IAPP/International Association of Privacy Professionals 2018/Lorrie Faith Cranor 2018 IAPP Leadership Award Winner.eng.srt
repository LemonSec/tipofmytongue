1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,590
I got started in privacy back in the

2
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,710
1990s when I was a graduate student at

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,010
Washington University in st. Louis I was

4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,120
doing work on electronic voting and

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,770
became interested in a lot of other

6
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,610
internet policy issues and I went to the

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,890
computers freedom and privacy conference

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,410
and it was this amazing experience for

9
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,719
me and I learned about a lot of

10
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,699
different issues including privacy

11
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,969
issues and I came back to my University

12
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,859
and I said we should have a course on

13
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,309
computers and society and they said okay

14
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,830
and you can teach it and in order to

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,500
prepare to teach these this course to

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,390
undergraduates I did a lot of reading

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,060
and I learned a lot about privacy and

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,299
then after I graduated I went to work

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,770
for AT&T Labs and in the first few weeks

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,530
that I was there I heard that there was

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,780
a new web privacy standard that people

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,320
were trying to to get started with and

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,939
somebody said why don't you go to this

24
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,920
meeting and see what this is all about

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,920
and and maybe help out with it and so I

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
went to this internet privacy working

27
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,470
group meeting and was one of two

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,229
engineers in the room and all of these

29
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,049
lawyers and policy folks looked at us

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,180
and said can you build us this standard

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,060
and not knowing any better I said sure

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,369
and thought well this this will be a fun

33
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,540
project for a few weeks and I started

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,610
working on it it's what became the p3p

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,710
project and I ended up chairing the

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,869
working group and seven years later we

37
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,000
had a standard and I learned a lot about

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,569
privacy

39
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,160
we've been looking at finding the best

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,470
ways to communicate with people about

41
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,450
privacy so over a decade ago we started

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,790
looking at privacy policies and looking

43
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,550
at how long they were and how much time

44
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,860
it would take people to actually read

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,170
those privacy policies and we came up

46
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,630
with some ridiculously large numbers and

47
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,970
it was clear that the idea that you

48
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,710
could get people to read privacy

49
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,340
policies was was just ridiculous so we

50
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,110
started looking at what could we do to

51
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,110
simplify privacy policies and give

52
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,360
people important information from

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,490
privacy policies without having to read

54
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,520
through pages and pages of legalese so

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,590
we developed something called a privacy

56
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,320
nutrition label which was a tabular

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,800
format standard format for representing

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,620
website privacy policies and we did some

59
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,570
user testing on that and iterated and

60
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,460
came up with something that seemed

61
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,209
pretty usable and now we're looking in

62
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,980
an IOT world a similar problem only in

63
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,320
some ways it's worse so it's already

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,510
hard enough for people to read privacy

65
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,140
policies on websites but in an Internet

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,780
of Things world you walk into a room and

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,390
there might be 20 smart lightbulbs and

68
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,780
smart thermostats and cameras and it's

69
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,790
it's really implausible to think that

70
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,920
someone would walk up to all the light

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,140
bulbs and read the privacy policies on

72
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,330
them but all of these devices are

73
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,530
collecting their data and so we've been

74
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,420
developing prototypes of systems where

75
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,480
these smart devices can broadcast their

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,010
privacy policies in a format that can be

77
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,240
automatically received and interpreted

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,700
by your smart phone or your smart watch

79
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,750
and your your personal device can

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,030
collect these policies read them

81
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,890
automatically and let you know if

82
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,750
there's something that you need to know

83
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,510
about based on your personal privacy

84
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,329
preference

85
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,310
so these are some of the things that

86
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,669
we're working on another project we're

87
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,280
looking at is trying to understand how

88
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,520
people think about privacy and what are

89
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,780
what are the things that are on their

90
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,990
mind when people talk about privacy so

91
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,520
what we've done is we've started

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,970
collecting drawings from people in

93
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,289
response to the prompt

94
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,780
what does privacy mean to you and at

95
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,240
this point we've collected over 350

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,930
drawings and these come from old people

97
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,270
young people children adults

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,919
some of them come from privacy

99
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,259
professionals but most of them are from

100
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,690
everyday people and we've been going

101
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,139
through them and examining them and

102
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,340
coding them to see what are the

103
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,259
different types of concepts that come

104
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,909
out in these drawings and what can they

105
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,919
teach us about how people think about

106
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:14,629
privacy so my colleagues and I started

107
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,060
hearing from people in companies who

108
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,129
were looking to hire privacy engineers

109
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:22,069
and they came to us and said do you have

110
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,490
any privacy students that we might

111
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,180
interview and we had some students

112
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,219
interested in privacy but but not that

113
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:34,340
many and yet we had a number of courses

114
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,370
here on privacy and privacy engineering

115
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,310
and we thought well it would be nice to

116
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,130
put this all together into a coherent

117
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,979
graduate program and we looked around to

118
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,020
see what other schools were doing in

119
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,879
this area and there wasn't very much

120
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,330
there are law schools that have a

121
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,219
concentration on privacy but among the

122
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,620
schools that have Technology programs

123
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,300
computer science and engineering

124
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,029
there was really no sort of degree

125
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,580
program that a student could take if

126
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,379
they wanted to focus on privacy

127
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,770
engineering so we decided to put

128
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,919
together a program that would be

129
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,310
specifically for technology students and

130
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,729
would go into legal and policy issues

131
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,389
but also very deep on the privacy

132
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,140
technology privacy algorithms

133
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,580
and also teach them some

134
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,460
interdisciplinary skills and and teach

135
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,760
them about usability and and user

136
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,310
testing and things like that as well so

137
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,130
we put together this three semester

138
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,680
program including some practical

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,420
experience with a capstone project and

140
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,160
and now we have the privacy engineering

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,500
master's program now in its fifth year

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:01,750
at Carnegie Mellon I think privacy is a

143
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,740
great field for people to get started in

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,470
people often assume that in order to get

145
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,210
into the privacy field you need to be a

146
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,030
lawyer or have a lot of policy expertise

147
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,030
but we're seeing increasingly that there

148
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,050
is room for technologists and privacy

149
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,540
engineers are really being sought after

150
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,840
today so this is a great field for that

151
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,800
I also think it's important to keep in

152
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,510
mind that this is an interdisciplinary

153
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,140
field and that whether you are a lawyer

154
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,490
or a technologist or something else the

155
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,320
the work that you're doing actually

156
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,110
impacts people everyday people and so

157
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,300
it's important to think about how your

158
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,940
laws or how your technology is going to

159
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,540
impact people and to try to put yourself

160
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,290
in their shoes and think about it I also

161
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,560
think that it's important to keep

162
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,270
learning keep reading attend ia PP

163
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,370
events attend other types of seminars

164
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,620
and workshops and keep learning so that

165
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,919
you stay up-to-date with the new laws

166
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,710
and policies but also new technologies

167
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,660
that are going to have a big impact on

168
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,200
