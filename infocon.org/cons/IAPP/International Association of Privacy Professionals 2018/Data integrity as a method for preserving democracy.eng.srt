00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,580
hi everyone we're in the enviable

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,530
position of standing between you and the

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,170
reception so we'll try to make it worth

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,529
your while if we can I'm David Becker I

6
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,500
am the executive director and founder of

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,450
the Center for election innovation and

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,790
research I've worked in elections for

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,239
over 20 years now many of them serving

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,010
as an attorney in the Justice Department

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,530
and I founded Cir to help improve the

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,390
integrity security and accuracy of

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,830
elections mostly in the United States

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,940
but also worldwide you may have heard

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,950
there's an election coming up in the

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,309
United States in nineteen days to be

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,710
precise just curious how many in here

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,520
who are eligible vote plan to vote in in

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,930
this election okay that's a lot of hands

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,660
just remember if you don't vote you will

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,470
have lied to me because people lie about

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,619
voter voting all the time because they

23
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,610
know they're supposed to do it so what's

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,890
gonna happen starting now actually is

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,290
about a hundred million American

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,030
citizens are gonna go out and vote in

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,049
this election to choose their government

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,909
in fact over two million already have

29
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,890
voted and when you get that many people

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,320
doing something like that it's natural

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,150
to have problems in a major election and

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,850
so you probably recall stories from

33
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,630
previous elections where there are

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,700
exceptionally long lines where people

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,080
are confused or people don't getting the

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,280
right information going to the wrong

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,750
place not sure what's on their ballot

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,140
and fears back someone who's very high

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,820
up in government came to me and said um

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,040
you know I've got a great idea on how to

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,790
fix this he said let's make elections

42
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,240
like Jiffy Lube

43
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,390
go on I'm interested so he said no hear

44
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,810
me out

45
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,570
so oil changes used to be really really

46
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,610
tough they used to take a long time they

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,780
were a big hassle but then Jiffy Lube

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,700
came along with a model and people were

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,489
in and out in 15 minutes it was great I

50
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,989
looked him and I said that's a great

51
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,810
idea because elections are just like oil

52
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,170
changes if everyone got an oil change on

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,720
the very same day every two to four

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,549
years in a building that was never

55
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,260
designed for oil changes conducted by

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,790
someone who had never seen the underside

57
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,630
of a car

58
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,370
so that's a challenge as election

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,320
officials face in this country everyone

60
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,670
expects everything to go smoothly but

61
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,070
there's a lot going on during that

62
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,500
during that election time and so a few

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,880
years back I hosted a conference with

64
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,530
about 200 leaders in the election field

65
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,180
people work in campaigns election

66
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,080
officials from around the country

67
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,210
Republicans Democrats and ask several of

68
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,950
them there's one thing that we could

69
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,010
work on and try to fix what would it be

70
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,290
and it was pretty much unanimous they

71
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,290
all said voter registration the voter

72
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,810
lists and the reason why is because

73
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,850
almost all of the problems you see in

74
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,380
elections when you're watching the news

75
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,570
or you might personally experience are

76
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,640
because there was an inaccurate or not

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,610
up-to-date record in a voters file that

78
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,590
can lead to long lines it can affect

79
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,270
even people behind that person in line

80
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,580
and lead to longer lines so why do we

81
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,280
have such trouble keeping the voter

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,770
lists up to date there's one big answer

83
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,920
for that mobility we as Americans are

84
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,050
very very mobile society one in eight

85
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,790
Americans moves in any given year and

86
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,770
that rate is about double amongst young

87
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,620
Americans and one thing about voter

88
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,750
registration is people don't understand

89
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,260
how it works about a third of people

90
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,260
think voter records just magically and

91
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,440
automatically update I moved I told the

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,630
post office I told the Motor Vehicles I

93
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,160
maybe told nobody but why isn't

94
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,130
magically updating and about 50% of

95
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,020
people don't know they can update their

96
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,000
voter registration address at the DMV at

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,380
the same time they're doing that and

98
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,910
that's despite the fact that's been

99
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,360
federal law for a quarter of a century

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,550
then adding to that is the pace of voter

101
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,490
registration elections is a business

102
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,800
with a forty eight month cycle I don't

103
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,030
know of any other business like that

104
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,090
we're 46 months of that cycle things

105
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,220
move on at a pretty easy clip and then

106
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,990
for about one to two months they spiked

107
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,750
off the charts what this means is if

108
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,329
someone moved in January of 2017 the

109
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,589
election officials probably aren't going

110
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,290
to know about it until October of 2020

111
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,840
in the meantime they're not getting any

112
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,490
information about the elections that are

113
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,690
relevant to them where they're where

114
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,610
their polling place is and election

115
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,720
officials are sending mail out to

116
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,430
someone who's who doesn't need it

117
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,570
because they're not there anymore so we

118
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,380
did some research on this I let

119
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,630
research a few years back to look at try

120
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,120
to quantify exactly how out of date the

121
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,670
voter lists are here's what we found

122
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,790
about one at 1.8 million records of

123
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,140
deceased individuals of still on the

124
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,880
rolls I choose to call them having voted

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,590
or aged out of voting and then about 2.7

126
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,790
million people were registered in

127
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,890
multiple states now were these people

128
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,250
committing fraud no these people had

129
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,470
moved out of their state had gone to the

130
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,670
new state and done what they were

131
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,380
supposed to do which is register to vote

132
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,630
because they were good citizens but

133
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,950
there was no way that their old state

134
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,780
ever could find out about that there's

135
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,090
no method for that and in fact there are

136
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,370
people here in this room right now who

137
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,720
have more than one voter registration

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,280
record somewhere in the United States

139
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,560
and you have no intention of casting two

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,820
ballots it's not fraud it's just an

141
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,370
administrative and efficiency so all

142
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,440
told we did the math and came up with a

143
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,210
number about 24 million records that

144
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,530
were out of date at any given point in

145
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,970
time that's about one in eight voter

146
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,150
records in the United States this has

147
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,090
real consequences because when people

148
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,950
show up at the at the polls and they try

149
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,270
to vote and their records out of date

150
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,980
they can't be given a regular ballot and

151
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,750
some of these people leave without

152
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,910
voting and about 300,000 votes it was

153
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,890
estimated or lost due to registration

154
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,590
problems in 2016 2016 was an election in

155
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,870
which about a hundred thousand votes

156
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,530
decided the election in three states and

157
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,670
then we have another problem with voter

158
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,740
registration not enough people were on

159
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,080
the lists about one in three eligible

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,810
voters isn't on the list anywhere

161
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,700
that's 73 million people so this is a

162
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,240
very difficult problem we we were trying

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,410
to solve it it's a problem I'd love to

164
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,910
get my hands around and what I did is I

165
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,250
formed a working group of about 40

166
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,410
experts election officials people from

167
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,040
both parties researchers and it occurred

168
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,170
to me that this might not be just a

169
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,750
policy problem this might be a data

170
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,440
problem in that election officials will

171
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,820
tell you one of the things they have a

172
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,500
great deal of difficulty with is even

173
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,990
when they do get information they might

174
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,000
have a John Doe on their voter list and

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
a John Doe from some other data source

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,570
but there's no way to say with any

177
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,160
degree of certainty that they are the

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
same John

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,310
oh this actually goes to so much of the

180
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,870
private sector problems and government

181
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,180
taking - taking data from two different

182
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,920
sources and trying to reconcile it and

183
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,560
save matches to the same individual so I

184
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,660
started asking around I to find someone

185
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,150
who might know something about this and

186
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,870
I got the name Jeff Jonas and so I I

187
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,900
called him up and asked him if he would

188
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,520
take part out Jeff felt I'll let you

189
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,440
tell the rest of the story I was I was

190
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,540
sitting there minding my own business he

191
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,830
calls me and goes hey do you want to be

192
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,060
part of a working group we're gonna

193
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,720
write a report

194
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,830
he's lucky I have this Jim Carrey

195
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,040
yes-man problem if you've seen the movie

196
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:40,880
because I knew I shouldn't but as it

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,100
turned out they needed this thing called

198
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,870
record matching the term of art for it

199
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,610
these days though is called entity

200
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,740
resolution this is my definition it's

201
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,810
when it's recognizing when two things

202
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,390
are the same two identities are the same

203
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,370
despite having been described

204
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,729
differently but in fact the converse is

205
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,280
true is recognizing when two

206
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,380
observations relate to different

207
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,500
identities despite having been described

208
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,620
similarly here I've just edited jrnsr

209
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,270
there's only now one letter different

210
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,400
and you have experienced this yourself

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,960
in probably many different ways if your

212
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,850
if your contact list and your phone has

213
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,040
duplicates that's an entity resolution

214
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,960
problem when you get duplicate mailings

215
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,790
when I go to a hotel and check-in and I

216
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,710
say look up my loyalty Club number they

217
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,530
say which one of you are you in here of

218
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,700
these three in Vegas and I'm like

219
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:39,260
they're all me we see banks kicking

220
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,089
customers out in Hong Kong for doing

221
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,229
money laundering and then they just turn

222
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,909
right back up in India with a different

223
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,230
Passport that's an entity resolution

224
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,990
problem and when evil people try to

225
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,190
sneak into the country and all they do

226
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,010
is change one letter in their

227
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,680
immigration form and we are government

228
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,839
misses them well that's an entity

229
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,700
resolution problem so I've been building

230
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,650
systems like this built one for the

231
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,030
casinos it became known as no we're a

232
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,440
non-obvious relationship awareness

233
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,150
they're trying to keep clever bad people

234
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,830
out by beyond buys it for

235
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,860
in 2005 buys my company they call it

236
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,410
identity in sight and in 2009 I went to

237
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,360
an executive and IBM and said will you

238
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,730
give me fifty million dollars to build

239
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,130
something I'm on a code name at g2 and I

240
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,090
want to create an AI that will do entity

241
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,760
resolution not use AI to do any of the

242
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,190
resolution but I want to build an AI

243
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,660
that does it it's human smart but

244
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,160
doesn't need humans to train it or tune

245
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,190
it and they let me get started and I'm

246
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,450
obsessed with this because I could only

247
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,160
build one thing that's what I would want

248
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,810
to work on next and I'm obsessed with

249
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,790
entity resolution because it's so

250
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,970
fundamental to all forms of intelligence

251
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,740
not just machine intelligence but we're

252
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,970
walking around the conference and I see

253
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,050
you and recognize you from somewhere

254
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,420
that's entity resolution it's in biology

255
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,200
I don't know if any of you who've seen

256
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,320
this called a lion whisperer

257
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,610
the beginning of this videos like this

258
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,290
the guys standing there in Africa and

259
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,210
he's going oh it's been a while since

260
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,590
I've seen him but I was raised with them

261
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,740
here kitty-kitty-kitty if you're

262
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,340
thinking how's this gonna turn out so

263
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,600
kitty kitty a couple of them come

264
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,190
running at him and then give a big hug

265
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,000
nice entity resolution so before I show

266
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,510
you how entity resolution was applied to

267
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,430
voter registration I'm gonna take you

268
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,500
through something a little 101 class I

269
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,480
like to call slow motion entity

270
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,870
resolution I spent 30 hours on the next

271
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,950
few charts so I want you to really work

272
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,050
this look at these three records and

273
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,880
tell me or consider I should say is this

274
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:49,820
one person two or three yes how many

275
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,910
think it's one how many think is to

276
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,890
three people well let's take a look at

277
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,520
this record the first record and the

278
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,790
third record share the same name address

279
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,060
and cell phone the first record and the

280
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,630
second record share a name a cell phone

281
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,310
and the date of birth except it's only

282
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,550
month and date transposed it turns out

283
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,510
this is a pretty

284
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,780
safe bet to put these three records into

285
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,820
one now this one here is pretty easy

286
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,180
same person or different the point is

287
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,950
here you can't just take the same email

288
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,240
address and assume two people are the

289
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,720
same too many families share email

290
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,540
addresses so you have to keep this out

291
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,490
we would think of it as a discovered

292
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,530
relationship and while I'm on

293
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,850
relationships this is kind of a freebie

294
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,200
but you also learn disclosed

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,780
relationships this is the spouse maybe

296
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,330
on the employment application or the

297
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,370
bank loan now take a look at records 6

298
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:01,460
compare it to record 1 similar name same

299
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,740
date of birth would you be really sure

300
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,980
it's the same person

301
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,460
hmm not so much so you have to hold that

302
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,870
out you have to be pessimistic you've

303
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,190
just called a possible match it would

304
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,500
take some human or some more information

305
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,100
to become sure about this now this has

306
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,570
been a tricky one over the years in

307
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,940
entity resolution where would you put

308
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:30,080
this record who is it if you're not

309
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,710
careful

310
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,870
it just gets randomly assigned to record

311
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,810
1 or 4 which would be really bad because

312
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,800
if record 7 said like shoot on sight

313
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,630
then you're like 50/50 got the wrong

314
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,110
person

315
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,320
and then the next recommendation would

316
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,520
be send the family flowers ok and so in

317
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,670
this case if that entity e1 in the

318
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,350
center didn't exist you could be pretty

319
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,660
confident that record 7 was part of e 2

320
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,070
in record 4 and vice versa if record 4

321
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,840
didn't exist you could be pretty sure

322
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,310
was part of e1 but because they both

323
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,460
exist it really could be either and so

324
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,680
you just really to be pessimistic yep to

325
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,260
keep it out now take a close look at

326
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,670
this record here and compare it to

327
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,400
record 2 name address cell phone good

328
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,030
it's gonna become part of e 1 but does

329
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,250
anybody want to bark out what they think

330
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,080
might else happen yeah so what you learn

331
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,420
when when record 8 becomes part of e 1

332
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,880
you learn an email address

333
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,890
and because of that record six now is

334
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,080
not just name and date of birth record

335
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,690
six is name date of birth and email

336
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,310
address not excuse me not date of birth

337
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:51,060
but it now a conjoins now this one here

338
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,700
is actually really hard to do at scale

339
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,170
record number nine shows up and compare

340
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,700
it to record three the names the same

341
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,380
except it's got seen here it's got the

342
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,140
same driver's license number but the

343
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,819
date of birth is not like one and two

344
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,910
the moment this record shows up it it

345
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,800
reveals to you that record three is

346
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,540
really the senior and you've had a

347
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,250
false-positive you've put two people

348
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,140
together when you shouldn't have and so

349
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,820
when nine shows up you have to pull

350
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:30,430
three out two more I spend a lot of time

351
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,190
on that part okay record ten think about

352
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:41,560
where that goes what you'll notice is

353
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,120
that it shares an address with one and

354
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,220
three but nothing else it shares the

355
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,380
name with record six the aka

356
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,350
it shares a phone with record to most

357
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,820
entity resolution systems are trying to

358
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,550
compare it to records like that but if

359
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,990
you think about it inside of that record

360
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,570
II won he won with all those records in

361
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,730
it has been learning the name and the

362
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,490
aka both phone numbers all the addresses

363
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,250
and so record ten doesn't match any

364
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,200
single record but it matches that hold

365
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,040
identity

366
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,140
this by the way turns out to be really

367
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,550
important to catch clever bad people

368
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,290
because clever bad people don't use the

369
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,780
same name address phone driver's license

370
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,600
on every record only the idiots do that

371
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,190
and they run out of gas on the way to

372
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,470
the operation they take wet matches to

373
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,480
the bomb okay and finally their EP Irish

374
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,610
is what if you are obligated by law to

375
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,580
delete record eight or it expires when

376
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,310
you lose eight you have to remember you

377
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,590
have to unlearn why six was a member so

378
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,910
the moment you delete 8 you have to be

379
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,440
able to pull six out and you're not sure

380
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,150
about ten anymore either

381
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,730
so that's entity resolution kind of 101

382
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,880
I've not had a room I've surveyed people

383
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,590
and it's really difficult for a human

384
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,150
being to just keep this in their head

385
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,580
and get those different moves correct

386
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,380
and so here's how it applies now to

387
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,510
voter registration here you have two

388
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,100
voter records and now that I've turned

389
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,480
you onto entity resolution experts those

390
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,430
two records you they're in two different

391
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,920
states two different addresses Maryland

392
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,960
Virginia they share a name that's

393
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,610
similar in a date of birth but that's

394
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,650
not enough each state has its own

395
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,670
driver's license number

396
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,820
but election offices have access to DMV

397
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,030
data and this DMV record finds its home

398
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,760
here because of the name the address and

399
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,260
the date of birth and the driver's

400
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,600
license and that left side has just

401
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,370
learned a Social Security number and the

402
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,680
Virginia office has access to DMV and

403
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,440
this record shares the name date of

404
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,740
birth and Virginia driver's license and

405
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,210
it connects this way and now both sides

406
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,160
have the same name date of birth and

407
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,190
social so the moment that final record

408
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,730
shows up in the lower right it does that

409
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,980
so the architecture of the system is

410
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,170
like this these records are arriving

411
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,810
from these different election offices

412
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,109
their voter and DMV data and then it

413
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,220
allows this central database to produce

414
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,569
recommendations for example ask Marilyn

415
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,490
let them know that maybe their voter has

416
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,619
moved so they can contact the voter and

417
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,080
that's where this thing G 2 is entity

418
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,620
resolving these records now we did one

419
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,940
more thing it's a privacy by design

420
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,270
feature in you know name and address or

421
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,030
public record but driver's license

422
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,200
social security number and date of birth

423
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,540
or not and so what we did is we

424
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,790
anonymize these kind of watch this close

425
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,080
I didn't know how to show you it's gonna

426
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,100
jiggle and then go to hashed values so

427
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,380
it's hashed with the secret key there

428
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,050
and then when it arrives in the at this

429
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,120
in the center where the indexes

430
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,960
it's hashed again and this helps reduce

431
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,880
the risk of unintended disclosure if

432
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,990
Sundy was listening into the piper

433
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,990
steals the database and so this is what

434
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,410
you know I helped with designing in this

435
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,550
working group and then what happens next

436
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,530
is the hard part so now fast forward to

437
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,540
2012 well before that I should sexually

438
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,180
say we're sitting when Jeff first kind

439
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,280
of roughly sketches out the architecture

440
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,620
for this a room of about thirty-five

441
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,490
forty hardened cynical election souls

442
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,350
who had been struggling with this

443
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,900
problem for decades and he puts it out

444
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,460
and they're this hush fell over the room

445
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,380
for a second and then one of them a

446
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,330
secretary of state of a big state

447
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,910
she literally gasped and we all kind of

448
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,830
crap cracked up for a second but it was

449
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,450
because all of them saw for the first

450
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,340
time there was a path forward to fixing

451
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,640
this really insoluble problem and that

452
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,309
was ultimately to create something we

453
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,090
call the Electronic Registration

454
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,400
information center or to make it a

455
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,530
little more manageable we call it Eric

456
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,480
for short so we launched Eric in 2012

457
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
it's a 501 C 3 it states voluntarily can

458
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,040
choose to join and the states that

459
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,620
participate run eric eric is not run by

460
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,809
me it's not run by the government it's

461
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,400
run by at least the federal governments

462
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,270
run by a Board of the states that that

463
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,670
participate and the first seven states

464
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,620
that joined in 2012 are Washington

465
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,960
Nevada Utah Colorado Maryland Delaware

466
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,010
and Virginia and then fast forward to

467
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,770
today we now have 24 states plus DC in

468
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,510
Eric states that range from as blue as

469
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,429
Connecticut Delaware and Oregon to as

470
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,490
red as Louisiana Utah and Alabama I

471
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,100
challenge you to find any voluntary

472
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,470
organization that has those states in it

473
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,170
doing the same thing in the same way and

474
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,700
you'll see in light blue they're kind of

475
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,190
aqua Florida and Massachusetts of both

476
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,920
passed bills to join as of next year

477
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,320
that will take the membership and Eric

478
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,330
over about the 50% of the American

479
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,840
population threshold what's really

480
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,150
remarkable is the success Eric has had

481
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,100
and enabling these states in a very

482
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,830
non political nonpartisan way to keep

483
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,150
their lists more up to date and I'm

484
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,820
gonna give you a little a little insight

485
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,980
into that first one of the things Eric

486
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,750
is found in just six years it's

487
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,539
identified over 7.2 million records of

488
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,700
voters who have moved in their same

489
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,309
state now think about this for a second

490
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:35,860
these voters the way Eric discovered it

491
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,110
because they told DMV that they had

492
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,440
moved elections never heard of it

493
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,880
so this citizen did exactly what they

494
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,679
were supposed to do and government

495
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,150
didn't have his act to have its act

496
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,590
together to share that information with

497
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,169
other agencies because of this these 7.2

498
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,690
million voters we're able to get their

499
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,309
addresses up to date meaning they're

500
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:55,840
getting information on elections that

501
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,400
are relevant to them not elections at

502
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,169
their old address they know where to

503
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:02,220
vote they know when an election happens

504
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,780
then an edition Eric has identified over

505
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,700
2.2 million registered voters who moved

506
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,440
out of the state there was no way for

507
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,950
States to do this before so person moves

508
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,940
from Colorado to Utah Colorado learns

509
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,650
they've moved out they confirmed that

510
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,270
information consistent with federal law

511
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,820
Utah then can actually invite them to

512
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,990
register and I'll talk about that in

513
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,370
just a second Eric also identified

514
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,380
220,000 people who've aged out of vote

515
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,980
aged out of voting and that's very very

516
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,720
helpful because one of the things that

517
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,039
people are very worried about is the

518
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,480
potential for fraud and although this

519
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,000
happens extremely rarely it's really

520
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,260
good when election officials can

521
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,460
demonstrate that they've done what they

522
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,900
needed to keep the voter lists up to

523
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,419
date even as people are dying and and

524
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:47,710
remove them from the list and then

525
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,570
lastly Eric does something really

526
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,169
interesting

527
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,120
Eric identifies in all of the states

528
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,070
that participate people who are eligible

529
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,419
but are who are not yet on the voter

530
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,159
list and the states agree that they're

531
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,720
gonna contact every single one of those

532
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,770
people and invite them to register

533
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,650
usually by secure and efficient online

534
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,840
voter registration as a result millions

535
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,179
of new registered voters I estimate that

536
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,770
somewhere between five and six million

537
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,610
in just six years

538
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,429
by definition new because they weren't

539
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:17,950
on the list before are now on the voter

540
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,470
lists in the Eric states this is the

541
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,840
single most effective voter registration

542
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,010
drive in the history of the United

543
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,960
States as far as I know it wasn't

544
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,309
conducted by candidates

545
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:28,930
it wasn't conducted by political power

546
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,930
it wasn't conducted by ideologues it was

547
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,960
done by government in a equal basis on a

548
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,540
nonpartisan basis all across the country

549
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,120
and all of that information is accurate

550
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,600
and up-to-date and none of this would

551
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,630
have been possible but for the

552
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,850
technology that Jeff gave to Eric and

553
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,960
tell them how many people in the IT

554
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
department of this Eric organization

555
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,740
that has almost 300 million records

556
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,020
probably 80 different files and running

557
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,300
half the states how many people in their

558
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:13,300
IT department in total and the states

559
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,800
are finding the data to being of

560
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,200
incredibly high quality to enabling them

561
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,940
to serve their voters better and while

562
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,330
this might all seem very esoteric to

563
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,280
people who don't work like I do in

564
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,130
elections all the time when you go vote

565
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,560
in a state that's participating in Eric

566
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,540
you're gonna see the benefits because

567
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,460
they're gonna be shorter lines there's

568
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,840
gonna be less of a possibility you're

569
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,370
gonna have to cast a provisional ballot

570
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,570
or be told you have to go somewhere else

571
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,310
there's gonna be more likelihood that

572
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,930
you get your stuff in your mailbox on

573
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,000
time and can vote early if you want to

574
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,220
or by mail and this is all thanks to

575
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,070
both the technology that that the Jeff

576
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,460
provided but also the privacy features

577
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,570
because one of the things that's very

578
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,480
important as we're dealing with voter

579
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,790
data although a lot of voter data is

580
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,490
public information as Jeff pointed out

581
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,890
date of birth social driver's license is

582
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,600
not and it's protected in every state

583
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,250
that I know of and so it was very

584
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,750
important that we made sure that

585
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,370
although we wanted the utility from

586
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,930
being able to use that information to

587
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,790
connect the dots to fit the puzzle

588
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,470
pieces together that we could protect

589
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,180
that data at the same time and Eric

590
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,870
wouldn't become a privacy problem so I'm

591
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,580
really glad we got a chance to meet and

592
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,530
work on this map I think it was really

593
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,030
his policy work the end of the

594
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,680
resolution part really isn't that hard

595
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,990
it's not magic so I was watching David

596
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,250
leave the policy work to make all of

597
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,500
this happen and it's been a project that

598
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,060
the team and I are really most proud of

599
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,250
about what entity resolutions done so

600
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,230
it's super exciting and then I actually

601
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,940
sponge you two out and one of a kind of

602
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,410
spin out into the sensing company and

603
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,610
we're still helping on the fraud

604
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,500
I'm still helping David as as his

605
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,840
aspirations to help roll this out across

606
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,270
more states anyway thanks thanks for

607
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,800
having us

608
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,919
[Applause]
