1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,420
how do we help product teams make good

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,270
decisions because because privacy

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,219
engineering to me begins with the idea

4
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:11,550
and so and the idea then has someone has

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,050
to decide yes that's an idea we should

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,120
go with so how do we help people make

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,119
good decisions so when I think about

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,650
helping product teams make good

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,179
decisions the first thing I think about

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,669
is aligning their incentives right where

11
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,890
you say where you go and explain to the

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,539
to a product team but they want to make

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,759
build a great product and you can you

14
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,910
talk to them about how great privacy is

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,320
something that they have to have in

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,410
order to have a great product a lot of

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,600
teams I work with start out there some

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,910
of them we go and explain this and

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,100
they're like oh I hadn't really thought

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,620
about that that's really important so

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,829
that once they have that desire and from

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,570
a compliance perspective it's good that

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,070
there's that there are also you know

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,140
checks in the process and checks in the

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,720
system but once you have that desire

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,370
then they have to actually know how to

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,679
do it so you need to be able to go and

28
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:06,090
teach them you need to be able to go and

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,219
help them whether that's written

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,579
material documentation or if you can get

31
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,490
it like if you can actually do this

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,749
infrastructure that makes doing the

33
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:18,780
right thing automatic if you can't do it

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,729
for everything right I don't I don't

35
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,520
know how to build a computer where I can

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,319
give it a give it a sentence and say is

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,259
this comprehensible to humans it is is

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,649
this sentence true about my system is it

39
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,450
true about the future product direction

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,310
right so there are a lot of places where

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,229
we have very human denominated values

42
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,789
that must be evaluated by humans so get

43
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,939
their lent incentives aligned get and

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,950
and and get them to understand how to do

45
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,249
it make it as easy as possible then I

46
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,709
think about metrics and I've been

47
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:53,670
spending a lot of time thinking about

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,710
metric perversity it's

49
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,290
a perverse metric is one where you can

50
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,909
make the metric move in the right

51
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,650
direction whichever one it is that you

52
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,560
want but in the real world the outcome

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,520
isn't what you want so if you if you say

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,590
oh I want to have more users sure I can

55
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,030
make you set it up so you have more

56
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,770
users but you doesn't necessarily you

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,980
mean you have more happy users it might

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,650
mean that what you have is a DDoS attack

59
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,420
so youyou really want to go and be

60
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,069
really careful about how you're

61
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,560
measuring things because people make

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,890
decisions based on on metrics and those

63
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,880
metrics may have a gap between between

64
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,070
the data they're showing and where they

65
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,269
are in the outside world

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,620
you
