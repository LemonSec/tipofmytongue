12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,399
this conference I didn't even stand in

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,469
line to get a badge I just came here and

14
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,210
got miked up and when someone said

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,780
Michael Finkel I jumped on the stage and

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,860
Here I am I I could be some fake Michael

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,990
Finkel who just showed up here and I'm

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,640
giving the top look I'm I don't even

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,380
have it memorized I'm oh I'm looking at

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,020
a piece of paper I don't think a real

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,840
Michael phikul would do that maybe I'm

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,460
gonna go and collect a Michael finkles

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,799
paycheck right after this and would any

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,220
of you ever know this is what my story

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,009
is about and I don't want to emphasize

26
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,890
right here before I get into this story

27
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:43,520
that this is all true no fake news here

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,829
actually feels a little weird I kind of

29
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,829
feel like this is a late night sort of

30
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,340
story like kind of like a a campfire

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,110
story like we should all be sitting

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,930
around you know like a fire it should be

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,369
did should be dark there should be I

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,009
don't know owls hooting and coyotes

35
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,719
calling and I should have like a

36
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,740
flashlight up to my face like this

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,350
but the slot that was given to me is in

38
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,290
the morning and so we will have to make

39
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,140
do this is also a creepy kind of crazy

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,270
story and I know that everybody tells

41
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,650
you that all I've got a crazy story I've

42
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,970
got a crazy story you hear that all the

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,900
time but of course not every crazy story

44
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,950
becomes a Hollywood movie and this one

45
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,830
did starring James Franco and Jonah Hill

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,960
and from right here in the United

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,130
Kingdom Felicity Jones and the movie

48
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,990
like the book I wrote about it is called

49
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,410
true story which is a bit of a

50
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,250
tongue-in-cheek

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,770
title because the main character as you

52
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,040
will soon see is a pathological liar and

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,470
also a murderer okay enough bragging

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,920
about this let's get into the story when

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,000
this story starts back in 2001 I was a

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,709
reporter for the New York Times I had

57
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,150
just gotten back actually from several

58
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,190
months of traveling and reporting in

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,860
Afghanistan covering the war between the

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,140
Northern Alliance and the Taliban and

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,300
before that I had spent many many months

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,739
in the is in Israel and the Palestinian

63
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,670
territories the story starts with a

64
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,030
phone call my cell phone rang one day

65
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,670
and my home in the northern United

66
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,570
States in Montana and I answered it and

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,430
on the other end of the line was a

68
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,550
reporter from a newspaper in Oregon in

69
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,810
the northwestern United States so I

70
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,880
answered the phone and it was one of the

71
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,370
strangest calls of my life probably not

72
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,250
one of the strangest the strangest the

73
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,489
reporter asked me if I was Michael

74
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,510
Finkel of the New York Times I said I

75
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,050
was and he didn't by the way asked me to

76
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,519
prove that I was Michael Finkel of the

77
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,680
New York Times and perhaps I feel maybe

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
this reporter would not make a very good

79
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,108
private

80
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,520
professional the reporter then told me

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,289
that a man named Christian Longo had

82
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:32,539
just been arrested in Mexico now until

83
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,539
that moment I had never heard the name

84
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,620
Christian Longo the reporter continued

85
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,020
by saying that Christian Longo was

86
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,250
wanted for four murders and really not

87
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,639
just any four murders possibly the most

88
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,969
horrific and unimaginable murders of

89
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,639
them all he was wanted for the murders

90
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,530
of his wife and his three young children

91
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,979
they were all found dead in Oregon

92
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,919
while the likely murderer this Christian

93
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,169
Longo fled to Mexico now I had no idea

94
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,639
why the reporter was telling me this the

95
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,099
reporter mentioned that Christian Longo

96
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,680
had been listed on the FBI's 10 most

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,310
wanted fugitives list at the time it was

98
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,430
the same list that contained Osama bin

99
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,759
Laden now this was intriguing especially

100
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,279
to a reporter like myself but I had no

101
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,440
clue why this guy was telling me all

102
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,550
this and so of course I asked why I said

103
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,949
are you telling me all this after

104
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,580
Christian Longo escaped to Mexico the

105
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,520
reporter said he changed his identity

106
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
which kind of makes sense for a fugitive

107
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,310
on the run but instead of adopting a

108
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,060
false alias he took on a real one and

109
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,620
apparently he had done an excellent job

110
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,069
convincing others of his new persona

111
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,509
while Christian Longo was in Mexico

112
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,490
wanted for the murder of his wife and

113
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,969
three young children he pretended to be

114
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:18,110
a journalist and his name in his

115
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,449
newspaper he told everyone he met was

116
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,740
you guessed it

117
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,259
Michael Finkel of the New York Times now

118
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,610
of course I'm a journalist so my

119
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,459
reaction was a journalistic reaction

120
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:31,860
like

121
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,069
what

122
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,479
how why yeah and anything a journalist

123
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,999
might do and I told the reporter of

124
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,949
course I need some more information I

125
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,539
need to speak with Christian Longo

126
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,849
himself what's going on and the reporter

127
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,150
said well that was impossible Christian

128
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,189
Longo was speaking with no one he was

129
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,590
locked in jail he had been extradited

130
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,229
from Mexico to the United States and

131
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,789
that's why the reporter was calling me

132
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,169
he said he thought I might be able to

133
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,449
provide some insight into this Christian

134
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,819
Longo he thought perhaps we knew each

135
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:10,610
other I said sorry I don't know anything

136
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,870
about this Christian Longo I have no

137
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,029
idea I have nothing to add I apologize

138
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,590
you're the first person to tell me about

139
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,550
this Christian Longo and we eventually

140
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,000
hung up now obviously I remember this

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,490
vividly I was like all my journalistic

142
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,229
senses were a little tingly and I was

143
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,719
wondering what's going on and I decided

144
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,150
well I'll send Christian Longo who's

145
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,830
ensconced in jail and talking to no and

146
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,870
I'll send him a letter in jail and I

147
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,219
wrote him a letter I said I was a

148
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,210
journalist I said I was the real Michael

149
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:48,080
Finkel and I included my phone number in

150
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,889
a couple of weeks later my phone rings

151
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,069
and I look at the caller ID and it says

152
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,379
inmates call and I answer and I don't

153
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,180
know how many of you spend time speaking

154
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,210
with inmates but if you do you might

155
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,889
know that before you can actually talk

156
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,240
to someone there's like this whole

157
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,430
recorded message it's like this legal

158
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,589
boilerplate about it's the government

159
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,689
binding arbitration limitation of

160
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,969
Liability terms and conditions etc it

161
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,449
goes on for a while and then finally it

162
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:26,240
says to accept this call dial one after

163
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,279
the tone and then there was a beep and I

164
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,919
dialed one Christian Longo I said I was

165
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,890
already to ask them these questions I'm

166
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,289
the real reporter remember I'm gonna ask

167
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,290
him these questions but the first thing

168
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,700
Christian Longo

169
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,990
did before I had a chance to ask him

170
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,690
anything without any salutation without

171
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,170
any small talk he asked me a question

172
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,420
how do I know he said that this is the

173
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,980
real Michael Finkel anyone could have

174
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,900
written me that letter he said trying

175
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,290
for a scoop this is exactly what I

176
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,900
imagine a good privacy professional

177
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,550
might do I think I may have compared

178
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,070
privacy professionals with psychopathic

179
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,420
murderers I hope you apologize I hope

180
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,430
you forgive me can we go on

181
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,920
so this Christian Longo wanted me to

182
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,960
prove that I was me it's sort of an odd

183
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,100
situation I'm not really sure how to

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,620
answer I said if you were here I could

185
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,490
show you my driver's license do you know

186
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,680
my mother's maiden name my social

187
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,580
security number

188
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:05,510
I don't said Christian Longo well I said

189
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,510
I think you're just gonna have to take

190
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:16,250
this one on faith not good enough he

191
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,990
said and I felt in his voice as if he

192
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,580
were like giving me some sort of

193
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,120
challenge or puzzle that I had to solve

194
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,130
but I didn't solve it I was stuck I

195
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,450
don't know what to tell you I said I was

196
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,830
prepared for that

197
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:42,100
he said smugly I've made a quiz for you

198
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,300
I was sort of astounded but actually I

199
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,699
was a little bit relieved and then

200
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,029
Christian Longo over the phone jail to

201
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,240
Montana proceeded to give me a 13

202
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,829
question quiz all of them about tiny

203
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,339
details in my stories that I had written

204
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,310
now I had no idea how he had known about

205
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,380
these details but first I figured I had

206
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,240
to pass this test I'm actually it was

207
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,910
kind of a hard test when I finished

208
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,370
writing an article I usually I'm sick of

209
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,829
it and I sort of jet it right out of my

210
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,720
mind and I don't really remember these

211
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,240
details and in fact I believe I got the

212
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,050
first two questions wrong I think one

213
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,180
cliff I think one question was what's

214
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,070
the name of a villiage someone lives in

215
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,990
in Afghanistan and another question was

216
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,149
how much money did this laborer make in

217
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,949
a year and I was these are details I do

218
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,500
not remember and I I thought for a

219
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,949
moment that I would be unable to prove

220
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:48,760
that I was really me and it was felt

221
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,350
like some sort of existential conundrum

222
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,040
in the end I was able to prove that I'm

223
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,720
me and then this fake Michael Finkel

224
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,540
tells me over the phone and in follow-up

225
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,699
calls and in many letters what it was

226
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,560
like to pretend to be me he said that he

227
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,120
had been reading my articles for quite a

228
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,829
long time and before the New York Times

229
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:20,589
I worked for travel magazines and sports

230
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,120
magazines I even wrote for skiing

231
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,889
magazine for a while and he had read my

232
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,959
articles for years he said he liked the

233
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,420
style he liked the adventures he said he

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,149
always wanted to be a journalist himself

235
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,279
able to just hop around the planet and

236
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,120
write the type of articles I write now I

237
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,850
am NOT a well-known writer not famous

238
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,920
writer not by a long shot in fact I

239
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,769
think I just have one fan and he turns

240
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,170
out to be

241
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,600
a psycho-killer but you take him where

242
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,190
you get him in this business Longo said

243
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,269
that he was a married at age 19 and he

244
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,100
had three kids immediately after he had

245
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,110
no time for a job like that which is a

246
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,029
situation I know what quite well I

247
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,829
happen to have three young kids and a

248
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,190
wife right now and I know how much time

249
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,350
it takes and he told me that my stories

250
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,300
he said struck what he called his

251
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,980
jealousy bone he also told me I love

252
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,050
this you have a writing style he said

253
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,630
that I was not embarrassed to call my

254
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:28,139
own then he proceeded to tell me how

255
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,010
easy it was to fool other people

256
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,529
he said all throughout his time in

257
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,519
Mexico at hotels at bars with people he

258
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,070
met on the bus he said that he was a

259
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,350
reporter from the New York Times he

260
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,540
bragged like I just did about all the

261
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,440
stories he had written he told these

262
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
tourists ah he was there on assignment

263
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,260
oh he said he was doing a story on Mayan

264
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,680
mysticism and exploring all the ancient

265
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,540
ruins Mayan ruins of Mexico I lived out

266
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,730
a dream Christian Longo told me

267
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,940
now I actually tracked down several of

268
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,500
the people Christian Longo the fake

269
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,350
Michael Finkel met in Mexico and they

270
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,589
all said they unquestionably believed he

271
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,690
was actually a reporter for The New York

272
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,910
Times named Michael Finkel here's one

273
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,470
quote he was well-spoken polite

274
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,839
obviously intelligent it made perfect

275
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,940
sense to me that he was working for the

276
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,579
New York Times he had a good sense of

277
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,579
humor another person told me that he

278
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,880
asked the fake Michael Finkel if he was

279
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,490
married and the fake Michael Finkel said

280
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,069
he used to have a wife and the guy said

281
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,529
what happened and he said I got rid of

282
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,360
her and implying that they had been

283
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,029
divorced now Christian Longo the fake

284
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,860
Mike Finkel said that the question he

285
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,380
was most often asked by these people was

286
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,769
how much do you get paid for an article

287
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,010
which was actually a question I

288
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,600
do get asked and the answer is

289
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,650
distressingly little he even purchased a

290
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,970
notebook and started to take notes he

291
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,390
gave out a made-up New York Times email

292
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,130
address to people who asked if they

293
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,320
could contact him and possibly try and

294
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,210
get their own works published which by

295
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,480
the way happens all the time to real

296
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,020
journalists it all felt so natural Longo

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,090
told me it made him feel important then

298
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,610
he met a woman an attractive young woman

299
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,380
who was trying to become a photographer

300
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,940
she brought her cameras to Mexico to

301
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,780
work on her fledgling career as a

302
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,120
professional photographer and Christian

303
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,410
Longo the fake Michael Finkel

304
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,400
immediately hired her she thought that

305
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,050
she had had the break of her career I

306
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,450
spoke with her she sent an excited email

307
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,280
to her mother saying she just got in a

308
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,750
big break she bumped into a New York

309
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,490
Times reporter and now she was on

310
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,320
assignment and these two worked together

311
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,650
for weeks they hiked jungle paths they

312
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,990
visited ruins they got up afar dawn to

313
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,340
beat the tourists they explored

314
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,620
underwater caves they climbed Mayan

315
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,390
pyramids and this woman was snapping

316
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,880
photos and this fake reporter was taking

317
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,430
notes this is what Christian Longo said

318
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,620
we worked as a well-oiled

319
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,190
photojournalist team and as I think you

320
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,710
are probably wondering yeah they

321
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,840
embarked on a romance as well now I have

322
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,580
been on assignment many many times with

323
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,920
some very attractive people and even

324
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,930
when I was single

325
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,270
that never happened to me and I actually

326
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,420
I actually was wondering for a while if

327
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,010
Christian long ago was doing a better

328
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,400
job of being me than I can do being me

329
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,800
now he even Oh Christian even went so

330
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,609
far as to draft an email to an editor at

331
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,810
the New York Times

332
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,550
explaining the article he wanted to

333
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,099
write and it's fortunate that he was in

334
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,170
a non-internet zone when he wrote that

335
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,190
and that before he mailed it the FBI

336
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,750
caught up with him and arrested him and

337
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,420
I sometimes wonder just how far he would

338
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,069
have gone and what if he was a really

339
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,060
good writer what if he was a better

340
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:31,270
writer than me anyway he was arrested by

341
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,170
the FBI was extradited from Mexico and

342
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,500
put in jail in Oregon where he was

343
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,710
awaiting trial

344
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,030
now after Christian Longo told me this

345
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,190
quite crazy story he also told me that

346
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,970
he was innocent of the murders and that

347
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,610
he would prove it to me now I'm not

348
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,350
going to go into this too much other

349
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,570
than to tell you after a ridiculous game

350
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,510
of cat and mouse that lasted more than a

351
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,950
year he did not prove it to me or I'm

352
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,430
happy to say to a jury he was found

353
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,530
guilty of the four murders and was

354
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,890
sentenced to death and to this day

355
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,410
Christian Longo is on death row at the

356
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,600
Oregon State Penitentiary now I

357
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,080
certainly hope nothing like this happens

358
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,290
to any of you but you are in this sort

359
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,150
of business the business where others

360
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,480
want to take information that belongs to

361
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,840
somebody else and use it for their own

362
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,730
nefarious purposes and how do you know

363
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,870
I've just listened to the last speaker

364
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,010
and been watching the news I feel like

365
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,370
it is an essential thing that everyone

366
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,140
in here is doing and not only that it

367
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,190
seems to grow more and more essential by

368
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,360
the day and I have to tell you one of

369
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,290
the very scariest things about Christian

370
00:18:59,290 --> 00:18:59,890
Longo

371
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:07,480
is that he is not scary at all not one

372
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,460
bit I met with him in jail several times

373
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,520
he was handsome charming well-spoken

374
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,040
basically with all the people in Mexico

375
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,560
said about him certainly much better

376
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,230
looking than me the people who can do

377
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,100
the most harm it turns out are often the

378
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,900
ones you might least expect to do that

379
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,880
long go up into the night of the murders

380
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,280
apparently never seemed to have a

381
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,870
violent moment in his life he seemed to

382
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,640
be an attentive father and loving spouse

383
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,710
he went to church every weekend he was

384
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,680
clean-cut unfailingly polite everybody

385
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,140
seemed to like him several women in his

386
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,790
church that I interview told me they

387
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,410
used to nudge their husbands and say why

388
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,210
can't you be more like Christian Longo

389
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,530
trust people but verify I think is the

390
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,200
expression and I think the case of

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,710
Christian Longo shows just why your job

392
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,360
is so important and so necessary you

393
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,200
never know where privacy is going to be

394
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,260
breached how information will be stolen

395
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,570
and used from what source data piracy

396
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,130
will arise it seems to come from the

397
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,530
most unexpected places not merely

398
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,460
psychopathic killers your vigilance is

399
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,780
needed I for one am most appreciative

400
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,760
for your work now before I conclude

401
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,050
there might be one small clue that I can

402
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:49,480
offer you no one not one person I

403
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,750
interviewed said they ever heard

404
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Christian Longo use a swear word now

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,440
there we are I find this absolutely

406
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,890
unbelievable no swear words never I

407
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,540
think the lesson here that I'd like you

408
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,870
to take away

409
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,250
is never trust a person who doesn't use

410
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,830
a swear word are we all in agreement

411
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,490
here

412
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:25,720
I sure hope so thank you

413
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:39,339
