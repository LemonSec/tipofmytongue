Michael Geist

24
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,990
great well thank you very much for the

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,509
introduction and thanks so much for the

26
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,929
invitation this is a room as I was even

27
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:23,090
walking around in the back earlier on

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,950
this is a room filled with people who I

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,609
have worked with who I long admired

30
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,390
followed not in the creepy sense but

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,130
followed - and and in terms of the

32
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,630
leadership that we've seen from so many

33
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,280
people and so it's it's a real honor and

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,259
a pleasure to have the chance - to come

35
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,909
and speak so I've titled this talk

36
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,939
tippet at 20 it's the time for Pipit at

37
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,780
2.0 as many of you will know we're

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,239
perhaps not thought a lot about this

39
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,640
year marks the 20th anniversary of the

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,759
introduction of Pippin I was in the fall

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,929
of 1998 as part of the OECD ministerial

42
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,629
on electronic commerce when the federal

43
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,700
government at the time was looking to

44
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,379
make a splash from a policy perspective

45
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,239
it introduced a number of different

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,068
things and one of them would become the

47
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,459
legislation that was PIPA and from my

48
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,129
perspective there that that arc and that

49
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,560
timeline resonates quite a lot today

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,870
because at the time much of the emphasis

51
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,660
was I guess partially on that oacd

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,599
ministerial but even more it was on what

53
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,130
was taking place in Europe and the

54
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,590
directive and the pressure that Canada

55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,019
like many other countries was facing

56
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,930
with respect to our own set of privacy

57
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,530
rules and up until I suppose about 15

58
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,470
minutes ago when suddenly now everyone

59
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,030
is just thinking about their next eight

60
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,329
months and consent related rules up

61
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,910
until that moment I think that the focus

62
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,950
for many in the room indeed the focus

63
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,109
for many on the cot in this conference

64
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,260
is the GDP our this was from this

65
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,599
morning it's now about 10 hours away I

66
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,450
think and so there's been an enormous

67
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,900
amount of attention not on our law but

68
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,849
rather on the European law and part of

69
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,769
that of course is that our inboxes

70
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,829
nowadays filled with messages about the

71
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,870
GDP are reminiscent of what we faced

72
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,569
here in Canada with respect to castle

73
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,660
the anti-spam legislation and it also

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,419
reflects this conference and there are

75
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,570
an amazing array of panels including

76
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:26,960
many

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,610
on the GDP are many of you will walk out

78
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,680
of this and attend one of these two

79
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,750
panels that are focused on GDP our and

80
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,420
there are many more that run throughout

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,090
the course of the the next two days and

82
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,390
while I recognize the importance of

83
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,060
focusing and thinking about that

84
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,190
legislation and its implications for

85
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,250
Canada I have to admit it makes me a

86
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,040
little sad to be thinking about someone

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,050
else's law it's yes it's important and

88
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,750
yes it has implications for us but I

89
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,060
think much like in 1998 when there was

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,560
that pressure to think about someone

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,050
else's law and how we might ensure that

92
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,930
ours met the standard I kind of wish

93
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,400
that we would be spending more time

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,950
thinking about our own legislation I

95
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,960
think the Commissioner just did some of

96
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,988
that within the current construct and a

97
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:19,910
lot of the discussion that I think will

98
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,280
follow whether on consent or different

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,110
sorts of practices are critically

100
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,520
important but I note that he was

101
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,620
cautious to emphasize that this is

102
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,780
guidance that fits within the existing

103
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,120
framework and I guess what I want to

104
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,670
emphasize a little bit is whether or not

105
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,890
we have the opportunity indeed the

106
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,960
necessity to try to change that

107
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,940
framework itself recognizing that 1998

108
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,290
doesn't feel that long ago I must admit

109
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,540
to me but nevertheless it is a long time

110
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,300
ago a time that people weren't thinking

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,760
as much about privacy I think it's fair

112
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,400
to say and in the current environment so

113
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,010
many Canadians so many people around the

114
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,440
world are today identifying privacy

115
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,540
particularly online privacy and some of

116
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,310
the digital issues as a significant

117
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,070
concern a time that obviously predates

118
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,520
the commercial emergence of Google or of

119
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,270
social media or of Edward snowed it's a

120
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,860
different world from a privacy

121
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,620
perspective from the one that existed

122
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,010
back when we first introduced our own

123
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,230
legislation and it seems to me that many

124
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,120
of the kinds of issues that have emerged

125
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,670
can be made to fit we've just seen an

126
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,310
illustration of trying to do that but

127
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,290
I'd argue that I think we can do better

128
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,360
from a legislative perspective

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,790
indeed even from some of the examples

130
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,500
that we just heard from the Commission

131
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,440
the future is now with respect to issues

132
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,320
that a decade or more ago we might have

133
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,150
talked about as something in the

134
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,620
distance there is the sidewalk labs

135
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,700
initiative I should note that I'm the

136
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,490
interim chair of the digital Advisory

137
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,730
Panel for the Toronto Waterfront side of

138
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,560
the story but I'm speaking for we

139
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,820
haven't even met yet but I'm just

140
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,560
speaking obviously on my own behalf but

141
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,710
that notion of smart cities and how it

142
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,290
fits within privacy rules especially

143
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,520
when you can bring in federal

144
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,140
commissioners but there's provincial

145
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,550
commissioners there's a range of other

146
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,260
areas doesn't necessarily fit neatly

147
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,200
within our legislative framework it

148
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,630
artificial intelligence AI is on the tip

149
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,490
of everybody's tongue right now and so

150
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,860
to some of the privacy issues that come

151
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,260
alongside of it and of course the

152
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,480
implications of trade and privacy an

153
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,850
issue that frankly wasn't at all on the

154
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,120
agenda in terms of incorporating privacy

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,760
related issues within trade agreements

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,410
is the sort of thing we didn't think

157
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,680
about two decades ago but as we seek to

158
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,280
renegotiate NAFTA and conclude this now

159
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,520
the CP TPP tabled just this week in the

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,070
House of Commons containing provisions

161
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,290
that have direct implications for some

162
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,200
of our privacy rules our future is

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,380
really now with some of these issues now

164
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,750
20 years under pipit I'm not going to

165
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,310
spend 20 years cycling through

166
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,530
everything that we've experienced over

167
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,110
the last two decades but to pick up on a

168
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,750
theme again that the Commissioner raised

169
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,120
it seems to me that we have generally

170
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,180
been more reactive than proactive and we

171
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,030
didn't plan this but it is great to hear

172
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,729
the office emphasizing the notion of

173
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:25,520
taking a more proactive approach I want

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,590
to talk about being more proactive not

175
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,900
in the context of the advice that we

176
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,660
might get from a regulator but rather

177
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,150
being more proactive in terms of what

178
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,729
the rules themselves look like from a

179
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,280
legislative perspective we have had a

180
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,710
tendency I would argue in Canada to be

181
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,460
very reactive events happen and so we

182
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,140
call people before parliamentary

183
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,990
committees or we have commissioners or

184
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,849
other authorities say that they're going

185
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:53,090
to

186
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,700
investigate as these various issues

187
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,470
emerge and we've seen some of these

188
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,000
things of course literally just take

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,610
place over the last number of days now

190
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,160
in a sense that's natural events happen

191
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,139
the public becomes more engaged

192
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,990
concerned and there is that view that

193
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,490
well surely someone needs to do

194
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,780
something and so the most obvious

195
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,620
response is okay we'll investigate but a

196
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,450
more proactive approach both on the

197
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,520
investigative side that we just heard

198
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,320
about but potentially also in the way

199
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,550
that we might address this through

200
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,729
legislation I think would be valuable we

201
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,710
also have a tendency to look elsewhere

202
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,770
in Canada's still small and so we often

203
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,500
talk about not necessarily but our laws

204
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,750
look like but what other laws look like

205
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,279
and what they mean for us whether that

206
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,140
is of course the GDP you are and in that

207
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,510
sense we're joined by people from around

208
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,159
the world who are thinking about much

209
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,370
the same kind of things but so to u.s.

210
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,140
laws and other sorts of laws we're very

211
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,930
often our frame of reference isn't

212
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,240
necessarily what we have here but rather

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,080
what takes place elsewhere even when we

214
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,570
do have rules they've taken an awful

215
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,270
long time to come to fruition we will

216
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,850
finally of course get data breach rules

217
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,210
put in place and taking effect later in

218
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,520
a number of months but the length of

219
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,280
time it has taken for that to to run

220
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,310
through the legislative and regulatory

221
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,470
cycle is certainly not at internet speed

222
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,660
and yet while that has been happening

223
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,330
there have been any number of examples

224
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,070
sometimes it feels like on a weekly

225
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,350
basis of why these kinds of rules were

226
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,900
so essential we see it we saw it as well

227
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
with the anti-spam legislation I

228
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,339
recognize there are a diversity of views

229
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,370
about but it also took a very long time

230
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,680
to see some of those rules come to

231
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,890
fruition and indeed even some shelved

232
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,570
altogether with respect to the private

233
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,959
right of action in fact even when we get

234
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,750
Studies on these issues whether it's the

235
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,850
FE Committee or the most recent

236
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,830
consultation that we had on right to D

237
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,450
index or right to be forgotten

238
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,550
I think we've become accustomed in

239
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,610
Canada to timelines that really do run

240
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,920
almost in decades when it comes to these

241
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,410
kinds of changes as opposed to being

242
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:06,830
farm

243
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,380
more responsive in in the way that we

244
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,030
are seeing industry the way we're seeing

245
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,410
technology the way we're seeing the

246
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,870
public itself become more actively

247
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,510
engaged and interested in some of these

248
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,840
kinds of concerns I'd in fact argue that

249
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,580
if we take a look at the last number of

250
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,740
years certainly the last decade with all

251
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,320
respect to Canada's privacy

252
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,880
commissioners at the federal provincial

253
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,790
level some of whom are some of who are

254
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,950
the best in the world at what they do

255
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,310
and I think are recognized as such when

256
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,290
it comes to Canadian privacy law over

257
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,570
the last decade it is the courts that

258
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,480
have had far more influence on the way

259
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,610
that we conceive of privacy and the

260
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,670
kinds of rules that get implemented in a

261
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,500
range of different places we've got a

262
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,990
Supreme Court of Canada that on so many

263
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,110
issues has been the leader when it comes

264
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,960
to rethinking or at least thinking about

265
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,210
what privacy rules look like whether

266
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,790
it's the Spencer decision in terms of a

267
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,030
reasonable expectation of privacy with

268
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,620
respect to our personal information for

269
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,560
internet providers the duas case putting

270
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,570
at put it from the Supreme Court of

271
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,150
Canada involving Facebook and Debby do

272
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,540
as putting the issue of contracts and

273
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,750
privacy squarely before the court and

274
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,450
the ability or not to try to opt out of

275
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,570
certain rules we've seen of course more

276
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,580
recently with respect to privacy on text

277
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,860
messages in the Muraki case and there

278
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,600
are many others removed taking a look at

279
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,310
some of these issues in terms of search

280
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,280
and then even in some instances lower

281
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,050
courts that have taken a look at tower

282
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,530
dumps and those kinds of issues indeed I

283
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,000
would argue that the cutting-edge

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,190
privacy issues the place where

285
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,980
technology meets privacy in so many

286
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,980
instances we have gotten more answers we

287
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,110
have gotten more framing from courts

288
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,200
interpreting the existing law then we

289
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,820
certainly have had from legislature

290
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,790
legislators and I would think argue

291
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,890
belief from commissioners as well and

292
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,650
it's no fault of commissioners in some

293
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,950
ways they they are given the tools and

294
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,950
left to interpret them the courts are

295
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,050
are left with the same in the Supreme

296
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,790
Court of Canada of course when facing

297
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,360
these issues

298
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,370
has little choice but to grapple with

299
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,200
some of these kinds of issues and

300
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,990
concerns but I think it's high time that

301
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,810
we shift some of this dialogue back and

302
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,720
shift some of the framing and the rules

303
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,529
back to the rule makers not just the

304
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,959
courts in this regard and I've forgot

305
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,950
that it was also going to mention even

306
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,529
right to be forgotten with global 24h

307
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,760
case so if we were to take shift from

308
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,399
this more reactive approach to a more

309
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,760
proactive approach when it comes not

310
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,550
just to the enforcement side as we heard

311
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,100
about a few minutes ago but also with

312
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,680
respect to the legislative side what

313
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,620
might some of that look like as we stand

314
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,709
at this precipice of PIPA des at 20 I

315
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,320
would say that it's a pip at a 2.0 is

316
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,579
what we're thinking about and the

317
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,649
foundations I'd argue are pretty well

318
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,209
known we've there are many people in

319
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,310
this room that have contributed to the

320
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,070
dialogue around some of these issues the

321
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,230
kinds of things that we ought to be

322
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,380
thinking about should we choose to move

323
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,170
forward in a more aggressive proactive

324
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,320
fashion then we have to date when it

325
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
comes to some of these legislative

326
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,820
related issues now consent was at the

327
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,589
very top of my list and apparently at

328
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,019
the very top of the list of the OPC as

329
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,709
well and so what we've just heard is a

330
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,470
rethinking of some of the consent

331
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,360
related issues or at a minimum and

332
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,430
updating of some of the guidance to

333
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,430
better reflect the kinds of collection

334
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,170
use and disclosure of personal

335
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,269
information that we have and how we can

336
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,630
better ensure that all Canadians make

337
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,449
more informed choices when it comes to

338
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,430
the kinds of consents that they provide

339
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,579
now I think that discussion that we're

340
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,350
going to see take place and indeed the

341
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,730
implementation that we're gonna see take

342
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,649
place over the next number of months is

343
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,390
is incredibly valuable I was excited

344
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,570
just sitting in my chair hearing about

345
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,430
these kinds of changes in thinking about

346
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,709
what some of those implications might be

347
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,870
not so much for the workload of many

348
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,540
people here in this room but rather what

349
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,300
it will look like one once it gets

350
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,920
operationalized for individual Canadians

351
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,690
in the same way that we've seen any

352
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,640
number of other Privacy Rule

353
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,279
changed the way people conceive of and

354
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,529
understand the information that gets

355
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,089
collected whether it's those annoying

356
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,120
emails through gdpr or other related

357
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,890
issues if you get a security breach

358
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,600
notice and they're like this too has the

359
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,779
potential to put this squarely in front

360
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,480
of Canadians and say here's what he's

361
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,300
actually happening and allow them enable

362
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,300
them to make more informed choices but

363
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,120
as I've referred to just a moment ago I

364
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,310
am conscious of the fact that all of

365
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,320
this still takes place within the

366
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,089
context of guidance and within the

367
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:10,100
context of the current sets of rules I

368
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,320
think it is worth asking the question

369
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,700
and I think actually have the answer

370
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,410
about whether or not we would be better

371
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,260
off with the full certainty of taking

372
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,019
these kinds of updated notions of what

373
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,810
consent really ought to mean in today's

374
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,120
world and ensuring that it is better

375
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,209
reflected within our legislation so to

376
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,190
from an enforcement and penalties

377
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,380
perspective this is an old issue that

378
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,420
goes back now really since the very

379
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,130
origins of PIPA down

380
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,829
but we are an outlier when we compare

381
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,040
our rules at the federal level with

382
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,050
privacy and data protection rules around

383
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,589
the world and you can't have a truly

384
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,800
effective legislative lead set of rules

385
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,770
can't have truly effective legislation

386
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,570
without ensuring that the enforcement

387
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,020
side has real power I can recall

388
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,170
discussions on that anti-spam task force

389
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,899
many years ago as to whether or not PIPA

390
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,029
duck could be an effective tool to

391
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,610
counter spam and one of the real

392
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,770
questions was that well we've got we

393
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,270
know who some of the spamming

394
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,029
organizations are they are sometimes

395
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,100
engaged in criminal activity and the

396
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,170
question was why would they even listen

397
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,699
to a Privacy Commissioner whose rules

398
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,040
are by designed to issue findings and

399
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,440
has to ultimately go to a court in order

400
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,140
to enforce and the answer came that

401
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,910
ironically enough built into the

402
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,640
legislation those same organizations

403
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,279
engaged potentially an unlawful activity

404
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,320
and we were operating on the assumption

405
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,660
that many were in fact operating under

406
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,510
with unlawful activity would be happy to

407
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,200
comply

408
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,639
wouldn't be happy they would be willing

409
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,910
to comply with investigations because

410
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,680
there were real penalties if you fail to

411
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,500
cooperate with an investigation and yet

412
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,510
what at the end of the day if all you

413
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,480
were left with was finding it would take

414
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,299
years through the court systems before

415
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,970
any of that might be enforced we ought

416
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,669
to do better within our legislation from

417
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,400
the very outset we have to recognize I

418
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,220
think that this law was conceived of and

419
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,829
passed at a time when the online digital

420
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,650
world looked entirely different from the

421
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,990
one that it does today the phones in our

422
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,319
pockets the the the SIRT the social

423
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,330
medias that we interact with the search

424
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,880
engines the wide range of apps and other

425
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,520
companies simply didn't exist now there

426
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,080
may have been people who were involved

427
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
in the process at the time that will

428
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,650
argue that they had the foresight that

429
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,360
they had the knowledge that all of this

430
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,390
was coming I'm not so sure anyone could

431
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,100
have fully predicted what this world

432
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,480
looks like today there were people that

433
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,760
did but I don't think that the design of

434
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,679
the law which was largely as everyone

435
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,110
knows designed to piggyback over even

436
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,390
earlier work through the Kent Canadian

437
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,090
standards Association really envisioned

438
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,760
this kind of world and so when we engage

439
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,940
in activities like a right to D index

440
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,040
and those kinds of consultations trying

441
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,490
to find ways to fit those notions into

442
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,040
existing laws I think with all respect

443
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,350
we do a bit of a disservice I don't

444
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,360
think they fit well within our current

445
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,850
rules our rules need true updating with

446
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,520
respect to online reputation and some of

447
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,160
the emerging technological online issues

448
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,410
whether AI or machine learning and the

449
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,630
like and I don't think that the law as

450
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,929
it stands today fits as well as it might

451
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,100
closely aligned with that of course is

452
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,679
some of the big data related issues

453
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,230
where the collection of data surpasses

454
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,419
what almost anyone might have imagined

455
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:44,570
twenty years ago our laws haven't kept

456
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,020
pace and while we talk about

457
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,610
transparency as being an important

458
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,290
notion and we've seen any number of

459
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,210
Canadian companies become more

460
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,919
aggressive with respect to issuing

461
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,679
transparency reports we still don't have

462
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,340
anything close to uniformity with

463
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,020
respect to that in fact we have some of

464
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,480
the largest most important organizations

465
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,480
some of the largest data collectors in

466
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,500
Canada who still do not issue annual

467
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,320
transparency reports they still tell

468
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,570
their customers in effect we will

469
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,210
collect your data we'll use it you may

470
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,860
disclose it there any number of things

471
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,560
we might do with it but we will not tell

472
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,050
you how many requests we've had for that

473
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,790
information the number of disclosures

474
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,740
that we've had for that information the

475
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,320
sorts of things that today for I think

476
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,530
most credible organizations operating in

477
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,980
the space would be seen as simply a cost

478
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,680
of doing business would be seen as being

479
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,590
part of the quid pro quo for being

480
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,650
trusted with our personal data so when

481
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,780
you're a large telecommunications

482
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,580
company or a large marketing agency and

483
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,950
you still don't issue regular

484
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,560
transparency reports that's a problem

485
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,410
that the law itself still doesn't

486
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,530
require this as a core element within

487
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,510
the law I would say is an even bigger

488
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,120
problem and surely part of what a

489
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,290
foundational tip at a 2.0 auto look like

490
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,290
now those are and it said some of the

491
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,510
foundations I'd like to finish up in my

492
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,130
last couple of minutes by highlighting

493
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,720
at least three principles that I think

494
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,180
ought to be imbued with in some of that

495
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,360
discussion one is that this ought not to

496
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,360
be just a discussion about the private

497
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,820
sector I think what we have also learned

498
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,220
whether through Snowden or otherwise is

499
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,680
the growing realization is we ping-pong

500
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,630
between are we more concerned with what

501
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,340
the private sector is doing with our

502
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,350
information are we more concerned with

503
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,790
what government might be doing with our

504
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,860
information I think the answer at the

505
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,140
end of the day of course is both that's

506
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,870
not to say that people have ill-will I

507
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,360
think that most organizations and

508
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,580
virtually all organizations in virtually

509
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,020
all in government have best of

510
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,550
intentions whether it's to keep us

511
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,770
secure whether it's to do business in

512
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,710
the right way and yet what we also know

513
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,420
is that if the rules and the enforcement

514
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,610
systems don't fully grapple with some of

515
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,530
these issues mistakes are made or more

516
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,270
aggressive interpretations of the law

517
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,910
are made and what we end up with is

518
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,170
people whose information is

519
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,940
collected sometimes misused and

520
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,530
sometimes used in ways that they never

521
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,740
would have imagined or envisioned now

522
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,390
from a governmental perspective the

523
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,240
holes here are huge as well it is well

524
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,340
known to everybody in this room that the

525
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,980
Privacy Act hasn't been updated for even

526
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,770
in a longer period of time and so the

527
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,780
government itself doesn't even hold

528
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,630
itself to the same standard that it

529
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,520
would expect of the private sector and

530
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,800
that represents a problem government

531
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
ought to lead in this regard lead by

532
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,070
example

533
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,350
not just in terms of what it does as a

534
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,870
government but also what it will do when

535
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,000
they we find these leaders within their

536
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,910
political parties so for example bill C

537
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,970
76 just introduced with respect to some

538
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,250
changes in terms of our elections and

539
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,410
our political parties ought to embarrass

540
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,890
every one of those political parties

541
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,270
idea that they refuse to hold themselves

542
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,880
to even basic standards in terms of the

543
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,620
kinds of information they collect and

544
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,660
the disclosures and the rules applicable

545
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,000
to that is embarrassing but it is not

546
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,460
surprising as I think we all know that

547
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,620
whether it's then Do Not Call list or

548
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,170
the anti-spam legislation politicians

549
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,850
and political parties have been quick to

550
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,550
exempt themselves at the very very start

551
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,770
of of those sorts of pieces of

552
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,050
legislation now perhaps in light of

553
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,400
things like Cambridge analytical

554
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,740
analytic I and others there is a growing

555
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,810
awareness of why that simply can't

556
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,200
continue to happen but a willingness of

557
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,450
a government that likes to paint itself

558
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,460
as a progressive government on these

559
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,440
issues to introduce a piece of

560
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,480
legislation and it doesn't even have

561
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,990
basic kinds of privacy safeguards built

562
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,630
in for what has been an obvious hole and

563
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,730
an obvious area of potential misuse is

564
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,590
that I say embarrassment that ought to

565
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,900
be addressed I think it's also bigger

566
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,150
than PIPA not just in the context of

567
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,880
we've also got to think about government

568
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,590
but in the sense that it is tough as I

569
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,770
even refer to a moment ago to rap PIPA a

570
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,320
private sector or public sector into

571
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,970
some of these emerging issues in smart

572
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,460
cities is a perfect example of a place

573
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,980
that sits somewhere between public and

574
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,050
private and different layers of

575
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,360
government at the same time with global

576
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,820
activities as well I don't know that

577
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,100
we've

578
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,470
good answers for what the legislative

579
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,509
framework looks like for some of these

580
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,940
issues I know that we need the

581
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,889
participants to proactively be concerned

582
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:40,320
with some of these issues but at the

583
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,090
same time when we think about what the

584
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,860
privacy frameworks might look like we

585
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,090
have to I think recognize that they

586
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,009
don't fit in as neatly as they once did

587
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,610
so to the overlap of these issues with

588
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,200
other areas and I mentioned a few

589
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,440
moments ago trade law I don't think

590
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,389
people would have much thought about

591
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:59,669
trade negotiations as a place where

592
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,519
privacy rules get made and yet when you

593
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,470
have data transfer rules when you have

594
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,169
data localization rules embedded within

595
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,779
some of our trade agreements there is a

596
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,970
discussion taking place around the

597
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,830
legislative frameworks that we all

598
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,320
operate under and think about that

599
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,139
largely excludes the very people who are

600
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:22,320
actively engaged in it we don't get a

601
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,419
say typically certainly not behind

602
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,250
closed doors when these negotiations

603
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,039
take place much of this is presented a

604
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,809
fete accompli and that I think ought to

605
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,509
concern us finally I think we need to

606
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:35,879
also be strategic when it comes to these

607
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,289
issues I think other countries have

608
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,289
recognized that data protection privacy

609
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,070
big data this isn't just about

610
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,080
protecting the public this isn't just

611
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,419
about compliance it's also about being

612
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,889
strategic in terms of some of the

613
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,929
advantages that we want to ensure the

614
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:54,299
Canadian businesses have data

615
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,460
localization for example is a tough

616
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,399
issue it's tough because there are I

617
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,320
think perfectly good arguments for why

618
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,990
we'd want to retain data within the

619
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,240
jurisdiction there are also good

620
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,429
arguments for why we want open networks

621
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:10,529
and want to ensure that data flows

622
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,500
freely across those borders not impeded

623
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,350
by restrictions that may not provide

624
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,330
real privacy protection in any event may

625
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,039
lead some to think that they've gotten

626
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,990
more of an illusory privacy protection

627
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,830
and so being strategic with our rules

628
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,690
with the in the hope that we ensure not

629
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,809
just that we have a cutting-edge

630
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,159
proactive set of rules that better

631
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,259
reflect the current environment today

632
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,620
but also ensure that those rules provide

633
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,289
the advantages economic and otherwise

634
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,659
for the Canadian

635
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,200
is critically important I'll conclude by

636
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,450
noting that the focus is as I started

637
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,200
very much right now in this room on this

638
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,220
clock but there's another clock it has

639
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,049
been six thousand six hundred and

640
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,570
fifteen days since Pippa de took effect

641
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,039
on April it was 13 2001 so that's not

642
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,960
even the day the clock since this was

643
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,269
first introduced it's rather the clock

644
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,879
since the law itself took effect that's

645
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:15,269
a long time and as we start thinking

646
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,119
about making sure that our rules are

647
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,889
relevant not just from an enforcement

648
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:22,769
perspective but also ensure that our

649
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:24,359
rules better reflect the environment

650
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,149
today let's start paying attention to

651
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:30,090
this clock and find ways to reset it

652
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,700
back to zero thanks very much for your

653
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,350
attention

654
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,540
[Applause]
