2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,790
good morning everyone and thank you for

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,750
the introduction as a woman working in

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,600
technology I was hoping to share this

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,330
morning with you the news that for the

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,000
first time in US history a woman was the

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,130
next president but I guess this hasn't

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,550
happened and as a scientist working for

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,520
the past 20 years of my career on

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,190
building data-driven machine learning

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,160
based of human behavior the results are

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
obviously extremely interesting to me

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,210
because I get I'm sure that there is

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,129
more research that we can do and better

15
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,140
models that we can build because if we

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,120
look at one of the latest polls from

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,600
yesterday the chances were clearly for

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,260
Clinton and in fact Newsweek even dare

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,320
to issue number with Clinton as the next

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,680
president and as we all know everything

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,140
was wrong right so I think this is very

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,420
interesting to me because Annie's been

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,909
mentioned in the panel we live in a

24
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,460
world where increasingly we are modeling

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,470
humans from data and we are making

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,990
decisions based on the results of those

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,479
analyses and what is clear is that

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
humans we are still unpredictable in a

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
sense and we are way more complex than

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,570
we think we are and also that we need to

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,030
be very cautious about the data that we

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,770
are using and understanding the

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,500
limitations of that data but I didn't

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,689
come here to talk about data-driven

35
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,840
models for predicting elections I came

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
here to talk to you about a topic that

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,270
might be not as known to you which is a

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,670
lot of the work that we have been doing

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,049
and other teams have been doing on

40
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,700
understanding the value of big data to

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,340
have positive social impact I will

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,290
describe work that we've done while I

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,780
was a telefónica I'm no longer a

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,940
telefónica but all the projects that I

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,530
will present were projects that within

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,610
my research team while I was a

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,910
telefónica

48
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,470
and in particular when we talk about big

49
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,010
data there are many sources of data a

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,510
lot of them have nothing to do with

51
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,850
humans there is a lot of data about the

52
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,940
universe about particles colliding in an

53
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,730
accelerator etc but a lot of the data is

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,940
human behavioral data and part of this

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,420
data comes from a device that we all

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,220
have in our pockets which is our mobile

57
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,250
phone because the reality is that the

58
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,230
mobile phone is the most pervasive piece

59
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,570
of technology in human history the

60
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,180
mobile phone penetration radians between

61
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,510
90% and 120% worldwide

62
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,610
we love our phones we spend more time

63
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,790
with our phones than with anyone in our

64
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,920
lives this is important to think about

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,010
and the phone is connected and it's

66
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,860
really much more than a phone in fact

67
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,390
many people don't even realize it's a

68
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,590
phone because they don't talk with it

69
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,060
anymore

70
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,280
and what is really relevant for this

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,340
talk this is a global phenomenon this is

72
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,620
a phenomenon happening everywhere both

73
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,660
in developing economies and in developed

74
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,340
economies and in the context of social

75
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,860
good most of the projects are done in

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,930
developing economies and the phone has

77
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,180
become an incredible tool to be able to

78
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,739
help you know those societies in fact in

79
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,820
2013 MIT Technology Review declared as

80
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,680
one of the breakthrough technologies of

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,040
2013 the idea of using the data coming

82
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,930
from cheap phones so coming from all

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,810
phones not just from smart phones as one

84
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,340
breakthrough technology that was going

85
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,920
to enable us to really solve important

86
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,380
problems or make better decisions and I

87
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,880
will illustrate this today during my

88
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,610
talk and as many of you might be aware

89
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,610
of this in the past couple years United

90
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,310
Nations has been really paying attention

91
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,280
to the potential value of data in the

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,620
context of the sustainable development

93
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,019
goals so when they were trying to define

94
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,060
the new 17 sustainable development goals

95
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,269
they called for a data revolution and

96
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,579
they commissioned a panel of experts and

97
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,738
one of them was actually my PhD advisor

98
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,950
at MIT to issue a white paper that will

99
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,200
help them understand the potential of

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,090
data and big data to

101
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,120
both reach the 17 Development Goals and

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,400
also measure whether we have achieved

103
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,110
them or not because one of the

104
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,370
challenges is not going to just

105
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,380
achieving them is that when you say we

106
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,479
want to eradicate poverty how do you

107
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,880
measure poverty how do you know that you

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,070
have a radical Authority so both for

109
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,600
measuring the goals and for achieving

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,729
the goals there is an opportunity to use

111
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,570
large-scale data to help so in my

112
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,580
research team at telefónica for the past

113
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,470
eight years we've been trying to answer

114
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,740
the question on the slide could we use

115
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,740
mobile digital footprints to help the

116
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,200
world both individually as individuals

117
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,370
and I'm going to talk about this today

118
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,889
but also the world at large and this is

119
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,479
a very abstract question so I'll try to

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,030
sort of like bring it down to earth in

121
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,979
my presentation as I mentioned we are

122
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,780
not the only people there is an entire

123
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,820
new field in computer science called

124
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,910
computational social sciences which has

125
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,150
emerged as the combination of

126
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,889
large-scale human behavioral data and

127
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,919
social sciences and sociology as well as

128
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,680
the new way of doing social sciences

129
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,330
where for the first time in human

130
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,050
history we are able to quantify

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,789
large-scale human behavior and this is

132
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:39,139
something that we've never been able to

133
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,360
do before so a lot of social science

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,310
theories were based on anecdotal

135
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,130
evidence or our intuitions but today

136
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,139
thanks to the existence of technology we

137
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,930
can actually verify or not those social

138
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,570
theories I'm gonna very quickly give you

139
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,169
an overview of how phone works just to

140
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,460
make it more clear the type of data that

141
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,979
I'm talking about but I imagine all of

142
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,570
you know this so this is a

143
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,660
simplification of how a phone would see

144
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,490
the world so the phone is to be

145
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,470
connected to a cell tower it's just

146
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,110
usually called a BTS and the cell towers

147
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,570
are all over the space you can see them

148
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,070
outside when you go to the cities you

149
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,410
see their their little antennas so

150
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,539
usually and this is a simplification is

151
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,070
more complex than this but in most

152
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,620
projects this is how we do it we divide

153
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,539
the space we do what is called a board

154
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,210
or a tessellation of the space where we

155
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,590
divide the space in these irregular

156
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,960
cells such that at the center of itself

157
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,830
there is a cell tower and all the phones

158
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,210
that are connected to the cell tower

159
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,440
here

160
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,500
are assumed to be here but there is a

161
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,650
fair amount of spatial uncertainty

162
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,510
because the size of this cell tower this

163
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,180
of the cells is proportional to the

164
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,590
density of cell towers which is

165
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,850
proportional to the density of

166
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,280
population so in urban areas it could be

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,350
a hundred meter by 100 meter in in rural

168
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,540
areas could be a few kilometers by few

169
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,430
kilometers so we are not talking about

170
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,540
GPS precision or all but still is some

171
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,350
graph sense of location temporally the

172
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,060
data that is typically used for these

173
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,490
projects is also very imprecise because

174
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,430
it's not an event-driven data so it's

175
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,830
not data that is being collected

176
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,110
continuously it's only recorded when the

177
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,700
phone is being used either when the

178
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,080
phone is making a phone call receiving a

179
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,730
phone call or sending or receiving an

180
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,520
SMS so the most common data that is used

181
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,780
for a lot of these projects is

182
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,560
anonymized an aggregated CDRs which you

183
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,000
might have heard of which are these

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,830
records that are generated when the

185
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,210
phone makes a phone call or receives a

186
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,370
phone call or sends an SMS and citizen

187
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,300
SMS and the fields that are usually

188
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,660
employed are the encrypted originating

189
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,910
phone destination phone and then the

190
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,790
location of the tower if it's known many

191
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,530
in many cases is not known for example

192
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,090
if it's from a different operator and

193
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,100
for phone calls also the duration of the

194
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,380
phone call so it's fairly coarse data

195
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,510
and is always done in an aggregated

196
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,100
manner I'm just going to show you two

197
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,840
videos so you get a sense of how this

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,300
data looks like the first video shows

199
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,370
the every bubble here is proportional

200
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,530
the size of the bubble is proportional

201
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,360
to the number of phone calls that a cell

202
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,760
tower is handling in that moment in time

203
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,400
and this is the state of Oaxaca Mexico

204
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,070
right before during and after an

205
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,020
earthquake takes place and the epicenter

206
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,260
of the earthquake will be here so I so

207
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,539
pay attention to what happens when the

208
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,179
earthquake takes place so here's the

209
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,409
epicenter and then there's this big

210
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,570
surge of phone calls so the fact that

211
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,460
that is this big surge of phone calls is

212
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,770
extremely valuable because when the

213
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,930
government needs to send

214
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,760
help or when an NGO needs to send help

215
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,690
thanks to the fact that that is the

216
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,730
search we can have an estimation of

217
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,230
roughly how many people are in the

218
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,230
affected areas so they can dimension

219
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,180
they help appropriately and this is

220
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,950
something that we have never been able

221
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,320
to do before if we look at the mobility

222
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,450
of phones then we get a sense of

223
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,610
mobility of large-scale mobility between

224
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,800
cities which is also very vulnerable in

225
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,540
some scenarios for example for Public

226
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:13,870
Health

227
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,690
so using this type of data which is very

228
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,690
course very aggregated and seemingly

229
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,290
useless

230
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,480
we actually are finding that it brings a

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,130
lot of value in a number of scenarios

232
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,720
and the four scenarios that we have

233
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,899
explored a telefónica where the first

234
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,940
one is how can we use this data for

235
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,940
helping design the cities better or

236
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,700
understand how cities are working the

237
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,950
second scenario is how can we help in

238
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,600
the case of official statistics and this

239
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,040
is an active discussion that is

240
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,990
happening right now in most official

241
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,320
statistics offices in a worldwide how

242
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,899
can we use new data sources to have more

243
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,880
up-to-date censuses that we have now

244
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,970
because usually they are 10 years apart

245
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,709
and as you all know society's very

246
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,540
dynamic and information from 10 years

247
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,580
ago or even from two years ago is

248
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,980
probably not applicable today the third

249
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,320
area is crisis management tools as an

250
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
example that I showed for the earthquake

251
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,589
and the fourth area is Public Health

252
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,660
tools and particularly in the context of

253
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,370
pandemics where human mobility is

254
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,529
critical and for the first time we can

255
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,360
model human mobility thanks to this type

256
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,630
of data so now I'm I don't have the time

257
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,209
to give you an example of four different

258
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,580
projects on these categories so to keep

259
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,380
with the spirit of the election I'm

260
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,640
going to ask for a vote

261
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,360
so I'm gonna give you four options and

262
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,070
then organize you to raise your hand and

263
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,680
whichever winner it is I'll explain that

264
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,079
project like in five or ten minutes so

265
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,339
the first project that I could talk

266
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,589
about is a project of how we use these

267
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:44,950
data to understand how effective the

268
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,140
Mexican government measures were during

269
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,410
the h1n1 flu pandemic the second project

270
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,500
is a parade that we did to predict crime

271
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,190
hotspots in London's Metropolitan Area

272
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,690
third project is a project that we did

273
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,170
within two projects but I can

274
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,970
top-1 we did one on inferring

275
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,130
socioeconomic status in a developing

276
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,019
country and another one on inferring

277
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,350
credit score to help the unbanked access

278
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,420
credit in a developing country and the

279
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,829
fourth one is similar to the earthquake

280
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,810
one but it's in the context of floodings

281
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,579
in Mexico in collaboration with the

282
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,889
governor of Mexico and United Nations so

283
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:23,810
votes for the pandemic one Wow no that

284
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,420
many votes for the crime one votes for

285
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,320
the credit one little bit less and votes

286
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,350
for the natural disaster okay so crime

287
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,880
it is so it's the only project that is

288
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,440
not in a developing economy here we go

289
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,709
so this project was done in the context

290
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,930
of data phone for social good the

291
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,630
telefónica organized and it's a project

292
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,040
in collaboration with MIT with fpk and

293
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
with the University of Trento and with a

294
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
top alliance where I'm actually chief

295
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,709
data scientist right now which is a

296
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,860
nonprofit focused on how to use big data

297
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,160
to help development and to help the

298
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,269
world as you all know crime affects the

299
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,240
quality of life of the area where the

300
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,279
crime is happening there have been a lot

301
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,470
of studies that have tried to find

302
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,160
relationships between different

303
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,720
socio-economic indicators or census

304
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,699
indicators and crime like an employment

305
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,850
and ethnicity and education levels and

306
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,060
so forth and in the past years you know

307
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,870
I also know there has been movement

308
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,660
towards focusing on place centric models

309
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,250
of crime as opposed to people centric

310
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,870
models of crime so there's been the

311
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,110
realization and I think you all can

312
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,899
empirically prove to that that crime

313
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,730
tends to be concentrated in certain

314
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,610
areas in space and most cities have safe

315
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,779
neighborhoods and also safe

316
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,029
neighborhoods so there is this concept

317
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,750
of a crime hot spot which is location in

318
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,000
space an area in space that tends to

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,199
have higher crimes than in other areas

320
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,839
in terms of theories to explain crime

321
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,490
and the relationship between crime and

322
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,850
the

323
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,949
environment I'm going to describe two

324
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,810
theories because they seem to be opposed

325
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,630
and we actually tried to figure out who

326
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,209
was right in this project so the first

327
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,630
theory are the theories of Jane Jacobs I

328
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,769
don't know if you've heard of Jane

329
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:28,279
Jacobs

330
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,800
anyone so she was a social activist in

331
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,540
the 60s and she did a lot of work on

332
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,310
trying to understand what made a city

333
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,810
liveable and what were the

334
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,699
characteristics that made a city be a

335
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,500
good place for people to be and one of

336
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
the topics that she discussed was crying

337
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,360
so she wrote a book called eyes on the

338
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,279
street and she talked about the fact

339
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,290
that areas that have a lot of diversity

340
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,480
and have a lot of people moving are

341
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,230
safer areas because we all act as sort

342
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,490
of like policemen of each other that's

343
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,810
what she talks about eyes on the street

344
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,899
so we all protect each other by looking

345
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,389
and seeing what's happening but our ten

346
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,420
years later Newman proposed the opposite

347
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,980
theory in a sense called the defensible

348
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,220
space theory where he said well places

349
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,440
that have a lot of movement and a lot of

350
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,259
people are less safe because they are

351
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,389
more anonymous so then people are less

352
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,980
protected so you we should have this

353
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,839
defensive or spaces what everyone knows

354
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,850
each other like gated communities where

355
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,279
only neighbors know each other and that

356
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,259
way would be safer so one of the

357
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,300
questions is so who was right because

358
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,610
they seem to be saying different things

359
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,060
and as I said all these theories until

360
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,399
now have been very difficult to prove or

361
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,550
disprove because we hadn't had access to

362
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,800
large-scale human behavioral data but

363
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,509
today we are able to start shedding some

364
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,360
light on this so I will tell you at the

365
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,610
end of the this project we could shed

366
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,290
some light on who was right but I'll

367
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,939
just do a quick poll so who things

368
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,230
change Jacobs was right

369
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,689
just raise your hand know that many

370
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,170
people so who thinks Newman was right

371
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,819
more people and I guess the rest of the

372
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,949
people you have your own theory which is

373
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:08,839
not here so anyways so as I also mention

374
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,790
you can have a people centric approach

375
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,410
to crime where you're trying to predict

376
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,910
if an individual is going to commit a

377
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,189
crime this is not what we're doing or

378
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:17,600
you can have a place centric perspective

379
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
or you say well I want to know whether

380
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,529
this neighborhood is gonna be safe or

381
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,269
not and that's what we are doing and

382
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,410
this is a very important distinction

383
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,860
because when we made this project

384
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,930
he made it to the press and most of the

385
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,180
headlines were Minority Report this and

386
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,740
that and he has nothing to do with like

387
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,589
them I know the report perspective so it

388
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,540
is a data-driven approach we're gonna be

389
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,339
using data it's a play centric approach

390
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,800
we're gonna be using multiple sources of

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,750
data so it's a multi-modal approach and

392
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,690
the goal is to predict crime for spots

393
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,470
in the metropolitan area of London so

394
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,269
the reason why is in London is because

395
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:53,190
this project was part of a data phone

396
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,320
the telefónica organized it was a data

397
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,079
from for sure ship good where

398
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,370
large-scale anonymized and aggregated

399
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,160
data was shared with research teams from

400
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,290
all over the world that could explore

401
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,810
how this data could be used for social

402
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,640
good and there was not only their mobile

403
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,630
data that was shared

404
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,579
there was also data shared because it

405
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,899
was in collaboration with the open data

406
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,670
Institute there was also data that was

407
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,079
shared from coming from the open data

408
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,089
Institute a lot of census data and

409
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:21,000
London data that open data for this

410
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,649
particular project we use three data

411
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,079
sets we used a mobile data set that we

412
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,730
call the smart stuff data set because it

413
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,220
comes from a product the telefónica had

414
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,100
in in the UK we had the criminal cases

415
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,899
data set which was a data set shared by

416
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,810
the London Police where it had the

417
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,459
number of crimes in the metropolitan

418
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,010
area of London for two months and then

419
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,959
the London borough profiles data set

420
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,880
which is the Census sort of like data

421
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,380
set has 64 indicators of census type of

422
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,360
information so quickly explain each data

423
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,779
set so the smart stuffs data set was the

424
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,240
data set coming from this product where

425
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,040
instead of dividing the space as I

426
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,110
showed before in this regular grid now

427
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,519
it's a regular grid but it's the same

428
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,439
idea you have squares the size of the

429
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,150
square is proportional is inversely

430
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,770
proportional to the density so the

431
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,240
higher the density the smaller the

432
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,780
square and then for each square and for

433
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,740
every hour what he was shared was the an

434
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,990
estimation of how many people were in

435
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,630
that square in that hour and estimation

436
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,910
in percentages of what percentage of

437
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,589
those people this was their home their

438
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,839
work or they were visiting and then a

439
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,470
market research company also provided

440
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,720
estimations on the gender splits and the

441
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,490
HS plates because that data is not

442
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,690
available just by looking at the

443
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,190
activity in their cell towers of

444
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,540
the crank data as I mentioned was shared

445
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,280
by the London police and it had two

446
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,050
months of data so we use one month for

447
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,150
training the models and one month for

448
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,710
testing the models so there is an

449
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,300
assumption that past behavior can

450
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,830
predict future behavior which as I share

451
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,180
with elections you might not always

452
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,500
apply but I hear it seems to work better

453
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,210
we need to define where our crime hot

454
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,010
spot is so we use the median value

455
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,440
across the entire metropolitan area and

456
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,690
areas that had higher than the median

457
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,610
where crime hotspots and lower the equal

458
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,600
to the median they were not crime

459
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
hotspots and then I'm not gonna go into

460
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,170
the details but this is I mention it

461
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,580
because all these things they seem very

462
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,970
simple and it's extremely hard so their

463
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,260
representation the spatial

464
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,100
representation is different between the

465
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,530
census data and the crime data and the

466
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,090
mobile data so the mobile data has

467
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,940
agreed but the official data the open

468
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,030
data has what is called the L is a way

469
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,010
that for you in the UK you probably

470
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,930
familiar with this which are the census

471
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,880
regions that have a mean population of

472
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,700
1500 and they are this very regular kind

473
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,790
of zip code kind of regions so one

474
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,980
important step is how you match both

475
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,590
datasets to have the same representation

476
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,290
so for each of these LS aways we had

477
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,900
access to the sixty-eight matrix there

478
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,430
are sort of like coming from the census

479
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,050
on which in the UK are very rich

480
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,240
we even have estimation of the happiness

481
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,400
levels of the people in those allosaurus

482
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,020
but there is more typical demographic

483
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,180
information like you know age and income

484
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,600
and there are house prices and education

485
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,730
levels and immigration levels and

486
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,490
unemployment levels etc so the challenge

487
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,430
is we built three different models so

488
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,800
the challenge is we either have the

489
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,440
mobile data or we have the census data

490
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,050
or we combine both we have all the data

491
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,360
and what we want to do is we use this

492
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,760
data for the month of December we train

493
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,320
the model with the month of December and

494
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,140
we want to predict which of these will

495
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,450
be a crime hot spot in the month of

496
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,930
January and see if we are able to do

497
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,460
this task which is not even sure whether

498
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,970
we can actually do it so to do this we

499
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,160
need to first compute some features from

500
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,350
the mobile data so usually in these

501
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,230
types of projects

502
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,130
you have a spatial-temporal series and

503
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,720
one of the questions is you don't know

504
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,990
what is the right temporal granularity

505
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,870
for the problem at hand so is the number

506
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,210
of people every hour the most important

507
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,500
variable or is it the number of people

508
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,360
in the mornings versus the evening's or

509
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
is it the number of people every day or

510
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,750
is it every week or is it every month we

511
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,520
don't know so typically what you do is

512
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,420
you compute very huge amount of features

513
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,380
thousands of features all the features

514
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,170
that you can imagine that could be

515
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,100
meaningful for this problem

516
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,110
and then you apply feature selection

517
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,960
techniques to identify which ones are

518
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,430
the features that seem to matter the

519
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,770
most for this problem so in this problem

520
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,780
we computed up to 6,000 features

521
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,300
originally and then we applied a feature

522
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,070
selection algorithm in this case was the

523
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,110
mean decrease of the Gini coefficient to

524
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,260
go down to 68 features coming from the

525
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,440
mobile data and we chose 68 to have the

526
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,240
same complexity in the model as the

527
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,010
census data because the census data were

528
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,140
sixty eight variables so at the end of

529
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,480
this process we had 68 features coming

530
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,090
from the mobile data 68 features coming

531
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,430
from the census data and then the ground

532
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,560
truth for the crimes and we built a

533
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,390
model only using the mobile data to

534
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,580
predict crimes a model only using the

535
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,350
census data to predict crimes and a

536
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,390
model that combined both to predict the

537
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,680
crimes and then the question is you know

538
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,630
how well can we do it and which one is

539
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,460
doing better so this is a binary

540
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,250
classification approach we use random

541
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,420
forests is a state of the art machine

542
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,190
learning algorithm and that was

543
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,630
performing better than other algorithms

544
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,060
and we got some surprising results so I

545
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,760
think the first surprising result is

546
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,460
that the mobile phone data model was

547
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,840
doing significantly better than the

548
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,140
model using only the census data which

549
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,090
had about a 62 percent accuracy versus

550
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,310
68 percent accuracy which was very

551
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,810
surprising because the census data is

552
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,940
very rich and very detailed data

553
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,800
compared to the other data and then when

554
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,180
we combined both models we reach almost

555
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,420
70% accuracy which is very clearly

556
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,700
illustrated in these two slides which

557
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,410
compare the ground truth versus the

558
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,390
predictions I'm joking I don't think you

559
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,820
can really tell you know who is which

560
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,070
one is knowing better but I think the

561
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,660
most interesting element beyond that you

562
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,880
can do it with 70% accuracy is when just

563
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,620
your start looking at which variables

564
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,010
matter

565
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,840
because they start shedding light on

566
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,059
what what is really correlated you know

567
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,240
with crimes so when I talked about the

568
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,740
fact that we don't know which temporal

569
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,870
granularity matters so we found that the

570
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,299
features about the daily dynamics we're

571
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,850
the ones that were being selected above

572
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,940
features of hourly dynamics or weekly

573
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,710
dynamics of monthly dynamics so it seems

574
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,690
that the daily dynamics was important to

575
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,640
predict the crime another observation

576
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,419
and this is like to reveal who was right

577
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,730
whether Jane Jacobs or Newman so we

578
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,160
found two evidences that support

579
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,290
actually Jane Jacobs so there are a

580
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,090
couple people that thought she was right

581
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,950
we found some evidence for that so the

582
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,720
first one was that we found that the

583
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,309
higher the number of residents the

584
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,190
higher the probability that there would

585
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,440
be a crime hot spot and this is a

586
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,549
contrast in Newman's theory that was

587
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:56,440
saying the opposite and we also found

588
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,080
that entropy related features were

589
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,179
actually correlated with lower crime an

590
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,330
entropy measures how predictable a

591
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,490
variable is which is somehow related to

592
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,559
Jane Jacobs theories of diversity and

593
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,110
having a lot of mix of people so these

594
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,000
two findings seem to point in the

595
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,500
direction that Jane Jacobs might have

596
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,130
been right

597
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,250
we also looked into the joint model that

598
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,020
has 16 features that were coming both

599
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,179
from the mobile data and the census data

600
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,580
and one of the surprises there was that

601
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,580
only six out of the 16 features were

602
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,860
coming from the Census and the other 62

603
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,049
features were about human dynamics so it

604
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:33,429
seems that for this particular problem

605
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,799
human dynamics is very important and

606
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,390
then when we looked at with census

607
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,750
variables we're important we found what

608
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,790
may be intuitively people could think is

609
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,500
correlated like unemployment levels or

610
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,650
immigration levels so this was one of

611
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,360
the first projects has been able to show

612
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,400
the value of human dynamic data coming

613
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,280
from in this case the passive mobile

614
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,669
network to predict crime so with this I

615
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,140
think I'm going to I don't know if I

616
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,370
have five more minutes so I should

617
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:06,580
finish organizers should I finish okay

618
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,240
so I'll just quickly finish they're like

619
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,700
I just wanted to probably just leave you

620
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,679
so if you're interested we have a lot of

621
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,450
scientific publications about this and

622
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,970
it was been many of the projects of a

623
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,970
PLL or in the press and I'll just

624
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,350
mention in two seconds some of the

625
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,900
barriers because this seems you know

626
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,640
that as I said this is very easy but

627
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,290
it's actually very hard and there are a

628
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,880
lot of barriers why we don't actually

629
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,150
are using big data to have real positive

630
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,309
impact you know right now this was a

631
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,470
research project it's not a real play

632
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,420
that is being used there are internal

633
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,100
barriers I don't know right now of any

634
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,809
company that has a big data for social

635
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:49,160
good Department

636
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,590
so there are various usually when this

637
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,179
happens there is an evangelist in the

638
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:55,280
company like myself or Nicoletta carved

639
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,130
in orange that are really advocating for

640
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,980
this there are a lot of barriers related

641
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,190
to the risk and benefit analysis and

642
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,540
potential and intended consequences of

643
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,460
some of these projects for example if

644
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,870
your modern migrations in a non

645
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,460
democratic country where the government

646
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,860
happens to you know be persecuting a

647
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,540
certain group then you know you could

648
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,880
have an internet consequence and in fact

649
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,800
one of the important things is the

650
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,040
creation of special panels and ethics

651
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,230
panels to make sure that you can

652
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,179
anticipate the maximum number of this

653
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,800
and intended consequences there are a

654
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,690
lot of barriers related to social

655
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,050
challenges as well and related to making

656
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,480
sure that this is a tool that will

657
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,420
benefit you know everyone and that we

658
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,670
don't create a gap you know between the

659
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,620
ones that have access to the data and

660
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,850
the technology and the ones that don't

661
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,470
because this is precisely the opposite

662
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,570
of overtime to do there are many

663
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,210
technical challenges that as a as an

664
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,740
expert in this topic I'm very excited

665
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,210
about there is loss of technical

666
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,010
challenges that you know we still need

667
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,110
to solve there are privacy and security

668
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,420
challenges as well even if the data is

669
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,250
fully aggregated fully anonymize is

670
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,230
fundamental to have a very clear code of

671
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,570
conduct on how to handle this data clear

672
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,280
ethics guidelines on how to handle the

673
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,350
data obviously protect the data make

674
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,090
sure that is you know securely stored

675
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,520
and so forth and finally there are a lot

676
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
of challenges in the way of working

677
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,309
because these projects are by nature

678
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,090
multi disciplinary and multi team so we

679
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,919
are collaborating with United Nations or

680
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,300
with the government or with the police

681
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,249
and we expect different languages

682
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:26,779
and we are computer scientists and they

683
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,330
are whatever lawyers or whatever they

684
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,479
are so it's very important to to make

685
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:33,769
sure that you know we understand each

686
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:35,389
other and we say the right expectations

687
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:37,970
and we actually have our agendas somehow

688
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,950
be aligned and that's not easy but I

689
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,529
think it's a fundamental and a

690
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,970
completely necessary condition for these

691
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,940
projects to become a reality I'm not

692
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,349
going to explain this if you're accuse

693
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:50,419
you can talk to me later but I think the

694
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,669
question that I leave you with is you

695
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:56,389
know how can we all responsibly make use

696
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,399
of this opportunity because the

697
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,710
opportunity is huge and I think it would

698
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,200
be a shame if we don't liberate it to

699
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,669
actually have positive impact in the

700
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,690
world thank you
