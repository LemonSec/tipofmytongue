1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,110
I good morning everyone and uh see ya

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,300

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,250
with you this morning um does this

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,160
middle one hop up as well no okay well

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,270
I'll have to sort of look over here then

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,090
um so I wanted to talk to you about how

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,990
we as practitioners are using data and

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,849
really sort of picking up on sort of

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,349
Christopher's taught this morning how do

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:29,849
we think about setting the right

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,450
conditions for use of our data using it

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,520
properly and sort of thinking about and

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,140
working very closely with our previously

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,610
team to make sure we're safe guarding

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,760
our customers data as we do this I'll

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,719
give you a little bit of background

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,289
about Transport for London many of you

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,360
know most of you have used our services

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,059
even sort of been coming here for the

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,890
conference Londoners of course use our

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,520
services all the time but we we provide

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,649
to boss street network services traffic

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,559
signals walking and cycling facilities

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,900
and I have a cable Emirates Airline

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,090
cable car and so we help people move

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,840
around London and but for us it's not

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,880
just about thinking about providing a

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,470
tube service and we have to think about

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,600
it as a tube service but we really want

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,030
to think about our customers and we need

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,340
to think about what is our purpose

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,080
Transport for London it sets out what

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,640
we're doing and this is really to help

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,380
London work and grow and make life in

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,689
London better and some of the challenges

36
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,850
we're facing is we have a growth of

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,520
population in London where 8.6 million

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,280
Londoners today we're expected to be 10

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,950
million by 2030 which is a phenomenal

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,240
sort of increase and we have to meet

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
that challenge of providing services

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,970
with growth and population and we also

43
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,220
can have to understand the rising

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,229
expectations of our customers in getting

45
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,460
around and certainly this is the

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,530
transformation of the digital world has

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,420
meant that our customers expect us to

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,040
sort of understand their travel and

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,270
provide services to that and so we

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,380
really need to understand what our

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,630
customers want and they they want to

52
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,829
understand who we are and what we're

53
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,910
doing they want to understand that we're

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,530
providing them reliable

55
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,030
variances on the on the network services

56
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,370
and a good customer experience value for

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,990
money and we need to show them that

58
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,280
we're thinking about progress and

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,650
innovation but what underpins all of

60
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,590
this is trust means they have to trust

61
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,240
that we are doing the right thing and we

62
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,280
have to understand that trust is our

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,650
license to operate so this is crucial

64
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,560
that we must get this right and so I'll

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,840
talk to you a bit about our data now as

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,819
I said London London's big in our data

67
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,100
is big and there's a whole set of range

68
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,230
of sources of data that we use in the

69
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,230
organization we have and I'll talk a lot

70
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,510
about how we use our ticketing data and

71
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,820
and that is our oyster ticketing our

72
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,380
contact us payment information and

73
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,800
magnetic tickets we also have a social

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,269
media data that we sort of use to

75
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,830
understand how our services are running

76
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,500
we use and I'll talk also about our best

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,160
location data and in particular how we

78
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,900
use that to understand how our services

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,180
are running and provide information back

80
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,670
to our customers and operators asset

81
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,269
data where our trains are and then we

82
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,709
have a range of sort of network

83
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,510
monitoring sensors on our road so

84
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,040
cameras CCTV we have we have traffic

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
signal data that provides information

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
about how our traffic signals are

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,269
running and then we also have just

88
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,350
generals with other traffic information

89
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,450
sensors in the road and then you'll see

90
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,680
sort of a dotted line and I'm going to

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,870
talk about this a little bit later which

92
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,780
is about apps and mobile Wi-Fi data man

93
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,220
this is a dotted line because this is

94
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,940
something that we are currently

95
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,160
exploring and this is actually an area

96
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,079
where we've gotten a huge amount of help

97
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,209
from the ICO in terms of giving us

98
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,829
guidance about how do we approach this

99
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,540
question because I'm going to talk to

100
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,040
you later about the potentials here and

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,109
how we need to think about this where

102
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,359
have we can unlock this this oil here

103
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,310
but being very careful about how we do

104
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,290
this and safeguard our customers and our

105
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,340
data and so really we take very very

106
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,400
seriously how we protect our personal

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,660
data as we think about our big Gator

108
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,980
approach and so we we do this in the

109
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,600
range of ways we think about how do we

110
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,250
have a transparent approach to privacy

111
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,200
so at the end you'll see the sort of the

112
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,740
link to our privacy pages on the on our

113
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,580
website we provide information at

114
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,349
point that we cook that we collect the

115
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,330
information but we also direct people

116
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,759
for more information on our website and

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,590
we provide this in a clear sort of

118
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,969
language so that people can really

119
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,699
understand it and understand how we're

120
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,240
using the information we have we do

121
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,389
privacy impact assessments and my team

122
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,030
works very very closely with the privacy

123
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,430
and data protection team and we really

124
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,750
sort of set out we discuss what we're

125
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,900
trying to do and think about the think

126
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,009
about this and then we should make sure

127
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,300
that all the controls are in place to

128
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,919
have properly sort of manage our data

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,770
and we have a regular engagement with

130
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,199
the ico we rely on their guidance so the

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,210
guys in some big data the guidance on

132
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,789
anonymization the februari guidance on

133
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,830
Wi-Fi have all been hugely helpful and

134
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,379
of course the twelve step so that sheet

135
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,330
that Christopher held up earlier has

136
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,930
also been very helpful for for us um and

137
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,029
then of course we this is something

138
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,919
that's that we look at it the senior

139
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,270
level and we make sure that all of ours

140
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,979
have employees who are handling customer

141
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,529
data and personal data are really

142
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,090
understand the importance of it we have

143
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,610
a training we make sure that we have

144
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,310
controlled access and we think about the

145
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,139
types of data the people access to do

146
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,819
their jobs and we're very precise about

147
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,969
who gets access to what data and so a

148
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:42,560
little bit of statistics about our data

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,370
so we have 26 million of the sort of

150
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,199
retail sort of Blue Oyster cards used in

151
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,020
about a year and we have about 4 million

152
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,449
of those that are registered with us we

153
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,629
have a concessionary photo card schemes

154
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,219
which are basically sort of discount or

155
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,889
free travel and we have 1.6 million of

156
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,900
these oyster photo cards used in the

157
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,719
past year we have nine point three

158
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,400
million contactez payment cards used in

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,379
the past 12 months this is an increasing

160
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,460
number because we're seeing a great

161
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,050
take-up of contactless payment on our

162
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,259
network this is so in addition to the

163
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,449
sort of the oyster card which many of

164
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,650
you will have traveled with this is a

165
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,000
basically able to use your bank card on

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,139
our network where you can just sort of

167
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,449
tap and go and we sort of introduced

168
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,479
this I'm in September 2014 and it's been

169
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,979
sort of a huge success for us in terms

170
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,930
of getting customers to not have to buy

171
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,479
their top up their oyster card and then

172
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,589
travel you can just sort of take your

173
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,370
bank card and travel

174
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,090
the network we then have a number of

175
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,000
sort of congestion charging and accounts

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
and customer records from the low

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,570
emission zone sent him there Cycle Hire

178
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,510
and then license taxing private hire

179
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,460
drivers and then our camera network so I

180
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,919
wanted to start and talk to you first

181
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,350
about our travel pattern analysis so

182
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,600
this is so this is what you how do used

183
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,310
to be used some of this data on that we

184
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,449
have in this first example it's just

185
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,070
just a small question that says okay

186
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,800
when you're looking at the network you

187
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,050
can sort of see how to do things change

188
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,060
over time and this is where we can sort

189
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,550
of take data I mean look at winter

190
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,020
wonderland so for those who are not

191
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,780
Londoners we have every year into the

192
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,310
November about a three-week sort of

193
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,530
festival in Hyde Park where we set up

194
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,639
sort of so fairground stalls and and

195
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,840
it's sort of very it's very fast tube

196
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,880
and it's very crowded particularly the

197
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,010
stations right around Hyde Park and so

198
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,960
we look we look at sort of to see how

199
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,660
how these sort of station performs the

200
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,070
week before who's coming and going

201
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,110
versus a week of the festival and it's

202
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,510
just a way to sort of show how do you

203
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,030
see in numbers what people would sort of

204
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,330
see it's a by observation but it's

205
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,410
something that's of a straightforward

206
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,970
exercise that we can do to sort of show

207
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,200
what's happening and we can sort of

208
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,460
compare at year after year and we look

209
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,900
at that trend this is an example where

210
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,400
we look at what happens when we have a

211
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
closure of the network so we have been

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,300
doing a lot of infrastructure

213
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,810
improvements Tottenham Court Road was

214
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,250
closed for a while depending at the time

215
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,870
it was either close to the central line

216
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,220
which the red line or the Northern Line

217
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,590
which is a black line because we've been

218
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,710
bringing in a new cross rail station so

219
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,020
one of the questions that we were asked

220
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,419
is okay well where did people go when

221
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,150
the station was closed or and then this

222
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,770
is when the stations open where were

223
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,880
people before and how did they switch

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,830
back and so again this is sort of an

225
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,120
interesting question to sort of see

226
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,250
what's happening it's interesting and

227
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,560
from an academic and intellectual point

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,390
of view it's also really useful because

229
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,070
we have conversations with retailers

230
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,810
because they you know they were

231
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,970
concerned so what's happening who's

232
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,680
who's traveling where are they going are

233
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
we losing people are people not

234
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,130
traveling and this is you can sort of

235
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,080
say okay we're we're looking at the

236
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,430
points of where customers are entering

237
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,590
and entering and exiting on the network

238
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,910
and see what they do when something

239
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,630
changes and so that's the work that

240
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,730
we've done on the tube that's actually a

241
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,190
lot of that data is just entry and exit

242
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,250
data we have aggregated that up and once

243
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,630
we do that you can actually open that

244
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,520
data up and so one of the things we're

245
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,430
also trying to do is provide as much

246
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,710
open data as possible we've done some

247
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,720
aggregated buckets of these sort of

248
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,310
entry and exit data and we have it on

249
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,779
our website we have some sort of sample

250
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,550
data sets out there and we're looking to

251
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,550
do more that this example I'm going to

252
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,950
talk to you about is an area where

253
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,050
actually it's we need more sophisticated

254
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,490
analysis because this is answering a

255
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,650
different question right the tube

256
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,700
question is actually fairly

257
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,960
straightforward because you have a tap

258
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,220
when someone enters you have a tap on

259
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,990
someone exits and you know what the

260
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,970
journey is you know who's coming in now

261
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,880
it's a fairly easy count but the

262
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,860
challenge we had was what do we do for

263
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,560
the bus network because you have a tap

264
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,170
on on our buses nobody caps off which

265
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,940
meant that before we should have built

266
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,880
an algorithm we were reliant upon people

267
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,350
handing out surveys so we did two things

268
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,270
we had people standing with clipboards

269
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,760
so like seeing how full buses looked

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,650
seeing where the bus was at a given

271
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,930
point in time like really manually

272
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,420
recording where the buses were and we

273
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,980
also had people handing at paper surveys

274
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,810
to say where did you come from where did

275
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,550
you go to but of course the survey is

276
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,490
very expensive you can only do a limited

277
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,190
period of time there is survey bias

278
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,050
because people going short distances

279
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,690
aren't going to fill out a survey so

280
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,300
it's not it's not as precise it's not as

281
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,650
helpful in terms of planning our bus

282
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,310
network so we worked with MIT we

283
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,330
actually do a number work with

284
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,790
universities where we gave them a

285
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,680
pseudonym eyes datasets under a

286
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,959
nondisclosure agreement and we work with

287
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,370
them to tackle somebody really

288
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,520
interesting questions on this so we we

289
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,870
worked with them to build an algorithm

290
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,959
which essentially takes we know where an

291
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,030
oyster card is because it records the

292
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,670
sort of location and the time stamp and

293
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,170
we know where someone taps on to

294
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,209
bus so if someone agrees on the bus the

295
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,790
bottom of the green and then we but they

296
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,130
don't we don't know where they got off

297
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,680
but we know where they tap on again so

298
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,230
if you see a first tap on the green line

299
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,980
and then you see the second tap say at

300
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,399
stop X on the red bus route we make an

301
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,600
inference that likely people exited on

302
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,810
stop a and or if someone's on the on the

303
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,880
underground next you assume that they

304
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,589
got off at the stop closest to the

305
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,750
underground to stop be and that well

306
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,160
you're not a hundred percent confident

307
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,209
that gives you a sort of a good

308
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,310
indication of how people are traveling

309
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,880
on the network and so we do this some of

310
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,350
these really interesting but just

311
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,790
interesting is not enough it's got to be

312
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,380
actually useful particularly when you're

313
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,930
still looking at customer information

314
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,880
customer data you always have to ask the

315
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,440
question about why are we doing this um

316
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,480
and what's the business value and what's

317
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,940
the business benefit and we use this to

318
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,709
start with one of the good examples was

319
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:04,470
in 2014 putney bridge had to close for

320
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,529
emergency repair works and we had the

321
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,760
sort of we found out very quickly with

322
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,410
sort of emergency works we had to figure

323
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,699
out what would happen because people

324
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:14,310
could walk across the bridge and people

325
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,079
could cycle across but you couldn't

326
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,279
actually take a bus across who could

327
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,820
drive cross so suddenly we looked had to

328
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,410
say how do you tackle this and so we

329
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,829
looked at weeks with the data and we

330
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,470
found forty thousand unique oyster cards

331
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,730
and they made a hundred and eleven

332
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,649
thousand bus journeys across the bridge

333
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,110
there were about eight hundred and forty

334
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,760
thousand journeys on those bus routes

335
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
but you know some of them were miles

336
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
away from the bridge so it didn't matter

337
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,500
you really wanted to understand who is

338
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,930
crossing the bridge and then about half

339
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,570
of these journeys started or ended close

340
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,360
to the bridge so for these journeys you

341
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,819
would actually find that you would

342
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,220
people would take one bus get off walk

343
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,690
across the bridge or walk across the

344
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,819
bridge get on a bus and it was be one

345
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,680
bus trip for them not ideal because it

346
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,000
had to walk across the bridge but it's

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,579
one bus about half actually have the bus

348
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,649
journey right in the middle and so were

349
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:05,819
these customers they were going to have

350
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,550
to take two buses and so for these

351
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,310
customers we did a bus transfer card so

352
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,890
we had to know roughly to scale the

353
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,360
problem and think about how does it help

354
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,310
our customers

355
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,200
and so we created this it wasn't very

356
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,570
high-tech it's fine with facing paper

357
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,970
card we hand it out but it worked and

358
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,520
then we also sort of we plan some

359
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,870
additional routes around the area so

360
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,240
people could severe out and we send

361
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,800
email to those who would be affected

362
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
just to minimize the impact and that

363
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,460
takes us over to how we're using to a

364
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,070
bar our customer information to provide

365
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,770
relevant and sort of timely emails to

366
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,190
our customers and we do this who rested

367
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,279
our customer database and we look at how

368
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,080
do we provide information that customers

369
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,150
will find useful by understanding their

370
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,710
travel patterns the recent travel

371
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,450
patterns and then sending them

372
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,880
information so if someone lives in South

373
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,740
London we won't necessarily send them

374
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,839
something about East London we say we've

375
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,210
there just cuz you don't we send out I

376
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,040
probably can send out 20 or 30 emails a

377
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,600
day we have to make sure we're sending

378
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,130
them out that are relevant to the

379
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,520
customers and we also will sense a very

380
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,980
broad base sort of information if

381
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,650
there's I'm a big event or strike or

382
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,930
weekend closures but otherwise we want

383
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,220
to get very precise and useful

384
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,260
information and what we do is you've

385
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,240
done surveys to see how relevant people

386
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,740
find this information and we do have a

387
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,720
good to return we're eighty-three

388
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,130
percent of our customers say that the

389
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,490
email services are useful so then this

390
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,980
is the what next piece right because

391
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,839
this is all we have to be thinking about

392
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,190
what do we do next with our with our

393
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,050
data how can we help provide better

394
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,300
services to our customers and of course

395
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
we all have to do this in the context of

396
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,300
the gdp are so we are we are sort of

397
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,680
doing more work on this right now and

398
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,589
we're sort of really working to further

399
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,810
embed even more emphasizes privacy by

400
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,550
design and a date of minimization

401
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,370
culture and we are really looking

402
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,440
through how we review how we're seeking

403
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,459
and obtaining and recording our consents

404
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,320
we're looking about you the difference

405
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,790
of Asus in which we carry out different

406
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,980
types of data processing we're

407
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,810
strengthening and testing our data

408
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,750
breach processes and procedures we and

409
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,430
then we also want to look at documenting

410
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,990
our data processing activities I'm

411
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,400
really going through very precise

412
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,640
exercise to do this and this and and

413
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,110
then lastly we really sort of have to

414
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,910
understand an update and right in plain

415
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,620
English our privacy notices and just

416
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,450
make sure that we are as clear and as

417
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:29,870
trans

418
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,580
and as possible and this goes back to

419
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,860
the sort of this regulatory importance

420
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,290
and also this fundamental need to make

421
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,970
sure our customers understand and trust

422
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,710
and we earn their trust to make sure

423
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,670
we're taking this seriously so and then

424
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,750
I want to talk to you a little bit about

425
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,300
what we would be doing further and we're

426
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,760
still exploring some of the stuff and

427
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,490
this is where we're thinking about how

428
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,690
do we challenge in the challenge of it

429
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,029
okay okay good back and how do we think

430
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,770
about the challenge of a right rising

431
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,540
numbers of customers on our our services

432
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,150
how do we help manage our service better

433
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,950
and provide useful information to them

434
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,529
and there's a range of ways but we were

435
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,150
thinking of doing this this is an

436
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,700
example where we look at customer

437
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,890
journey times from tap to tap on the

438
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,529
network we segregate them up and then we

439
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,540
look at what a regular sort of usual

440
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,550
journey time might be and then we also

441
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,140
can provide that information on what the

442
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,029
current journey time is and this is

443
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,529
helpful so if there's a problem on a

444
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,810
line you might say oh actually you know

445
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,029
it I know normally this takes 10 minutes

446
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:34,940
but it's taking 14 minutes that's

447
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,589
probably okay I mean if things are

448
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,810
congested things slow down a bit because

449
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,820
people are the doors have to stay open

450
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,670
longer as people getting on and off it's

451
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,350
just generally slower you might not get

452
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,910
the first train but it's useful

453
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,500
information to be transparent to our

454
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
customers about what's happening on the

455
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
network and then of course if you do a

456
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,230
problem you can proactively tell them

457
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,060
and they may take a different route or

458
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,459
change your travel and this is where

459
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,290
again we're thinking about how do we

460
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,060
provide this information about just

461
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,400
general to the state of the network and

462
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,500
this is an example where we're looking

463
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,980
at crowding and actually our Victoria

464
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,230
Line trains they actually the most

465
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,990
useful precise data about how heavy a

466
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,000
train is at the moment they weigh

467
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,319
themselves from the signalling system

468
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,270
and so you can take that which is really

469
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,640
cool our other trains do that too

470
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
although the Victoria Line trains give

471
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,059
is the best data right because some of

472
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,770
the others don't the they don't get as

473
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,690
much detail but it's you can see you

474
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,920
know how heavy a train is when it's

475
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,660
empty and then you make assumptions on

476
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,690
how have how heavy the trains are when

477
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,190
you have people on them and yeah yeah

478
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,110
you make some assumptions about that way

479
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,660
to people but yeah but it gives you a

480
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,570
sense

481
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,519
and then so then what we can do is if we

482
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,620
know how people are where people are on

483
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,200
the network out or and historically have

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
either historically or in real time you

485
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,490
can begin to predict what the trains are

486
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,600
going to look like when they get to your

487
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,210
station um which is particularly useful

488
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,549
if you have different routes you might

489
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,500
go to you know so you know for example

490
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,210
if you're a green park maybe you take

491
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,590
the Piccadilly line into the Victoria

492
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,019
Line the Victoria Line may be faster but

493
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,669
if it's really crowded and you have to

494
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,139
wait three trains to get on it you're

495
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,220
better off taking the Piccadilly line

496
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,200
same for you student for example with

497
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,370
the northern line and the and the

498
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,799
Victoria Line and so we can sort of

499
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,480
provide this information to customers

500
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,139
that is relevant and useful to them this

501
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,730
is sort of direction we're trying to

502
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,879
explore um the other thing we're looking

503
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:30,059
at doing is how if people want to opt in

504
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,830
for even more personalized services

505
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,259
we're exploring how this might work so

506
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,990
if people were to choose to register

507
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,409
their device I and we could provide them

508
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:42,059
even more specific information relevant

509
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,789
to them and you might choose to register

510
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,220
your device on a desktop laptop and you

511
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,600
might even choose to share your location

512
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,210
and this is something where the ICA was

513
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,039
really helpful in terms of beginning to

514
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,779
explore this with us and giving us some

515
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,820
suggestions on how to approach this and

516
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,470
they suggested we do some customer

517
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,720
research which was sort of hugely

518
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,490
helpful just to make understand what our

519
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,019
customers were thinking would they value

520
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,759
this I'm is this a service that if you

521
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,149
could opt in what people like it so we

522
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,440
did a little bit of research on this

523
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,860
we're just to say okay we gave them for

524
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,210
different types of scenarios of how we

525
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,970
might collect their data and we asked

526
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,529
different sort of groups about what they

527
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,779
felt and customers were positive about

528
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,200
this they said they understood

529
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,070
particular understood the purpose why

530
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,559
they really felt that they wanted to

531
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,419
understand the benefits to them and when

532
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,620
we explained we could do some of these

533
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,990
things like provide very specific

534
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,309
information about the route that they

535
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,750
were going to take in the mornings if it

536
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,960
was delayed and send them a message they

537
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,480
were comfortable with that you know

538
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,980
understanding they could opt in to get

539
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,679
this information but and they were clear

540
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,659
that they want it they we needed to be

541
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,279
clear we needed to be transparent about

542
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,350
what we're doing we needed to explain it

543
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,690
we needed to communicate why we were

544
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,260
doing this

545
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,600
and and actually deliver benefits and

546
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,310
make it useful to them and that was

547
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,600
really important to make sure that we

548
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,090
were doing that and then we would also

549
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,730
need to sort of reassure our customers

550
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,460
and we were taking some data protection

551
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,780
and protecting their data and securing

552
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,210
their data and so some of the things

553
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,850
that we're exploring now would be how we

554
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,070
might do this with sending sort of

555
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,450
notification some of this we can do this

556
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,230
already so we do refunds so in fact my

557
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,710
team today are looking at the impact of

558
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,580
yesterday we had a problem on the

559
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,380
Jubilee Line where we had some sort of

560
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,920
customers who were affected by service

561
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,600
outage we had some signal failures and

562
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,400
so we already have a people can go on to

563
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,780
our website if they were delayed for

564
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,840
more than 15 minutes and claimed for

565
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,580
their journeys they put in their journey

566
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,620
information and we validate did they

567
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,060
actually travel and then we offer them a

568
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,630
refund back but we on a bad day and it

569
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,370
looks like yesterday is a bad day we'll

570
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,750
see how many people are affected and if

571
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,820
it was a significant impact we will

572
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,470
proactively just push out refunds to

573
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,140
customers who were affected but we're

574
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,730
also looking at other notifications that

575
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,790
we could do particularly things like if

576
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,230
we sort of can push information to

577
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,330
mobile devices in the future send people

578
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,140
text messages email them and certainly

579
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,460
the more information we have about

580
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,470
customers travel patterns a better week

581
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,030
more relevant information we can give

582
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,460
and this is the trade-off right so we if

583
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,650
we our customers want to share that

584
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,450
information with us we can sort of

585
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,950
design relevant information that's

586
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,050
specific back to them but it's making

587
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,580
sure that we have the right trade-off

588
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,580
and that they feel that there's value a

589
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,380
tangible value that they'll see at a

590
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,350
trust in us that we have to deliver on

591
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,540
and so this is where we're going in

592
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,280
terms of how we're so thinking about the

593
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,810
integrated network it's a last bit also

594
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,670
to just say is that we also interested

595
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,840
in in the sort of connection between

596
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,060
people who are are driving on the

597
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,760
network and walking and cycling and when

598
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,630
they're traveling on the public

599
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,490
transport network and so again thinking

600
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,620
about ways we can understand how they're

601
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,240
using our network end-to-end is really

602
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,860
helpful for us to help provide

603
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,000
information how they can use it better

604
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,580
so that's essentially we for now and

605
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,690
here's our link to our privacy pages and

606
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,250
I email so thank you very much for

607
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,970
inviting me to speak
