00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,740
there's no recognition dark profession

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,660
more important in the vanguard award and

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,580
I'm both humbled and honored to be among

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,950
builds recognized by ia PP and our

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,949
profession my start and privacy actually

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,659
began on this 20 years ago when it was

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,070
part of the team that hired our first

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,739
ppl barb Lawler but the real journey

10
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,079
began ten years ago when barb actually

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,300
moved it into it and I was recruited to

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,699
integrate and lead the privacy function

13
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,059
for HP two weeks into my role leading

14
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,550
privacy HP suffered a major incident

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,190
involving pretexting the company had

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,440
always taken privacy very serious but

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,539
the incident led the leadership focusing

18
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,399
on the topic in asking us to be

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,530
visionary in our thinking which led to a

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,569
multi-year strategy and developing a

21
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,099
comprehensive program based on

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,710
accountability and social responsibility

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,759
in building a comprehensive program

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,810
nothing is more important than the

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,579
strategic partnerships that you build

26
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,130
within the company we can all create a

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,799
vision but unless those who impact data

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,840
are fully engaged and feel part of it

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,659
it's never going to happen it's critical

30
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,780
to forge true partnerships as our data

31
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,820
driven world becomes even more complex

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,520
and interconnected the only way we're

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,079
going to stay on the right side of right

34
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,810
is to think beyond mere liability and

35
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,390
fully embrace social responsibility and

36
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,850
ethics to help us balance those tensions

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,149
of using information robustly but

38
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,950
ensuring that the rights and freedoms of

39
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,259
individuals of respective this

40
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,420
profession is expanding and we all have

41
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,119
to expand our capabilities even faster

42
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,439
