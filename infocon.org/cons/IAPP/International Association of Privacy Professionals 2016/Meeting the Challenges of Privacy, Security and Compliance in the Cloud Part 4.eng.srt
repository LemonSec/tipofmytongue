1
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,500
there we go all right that's the fastest

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
I've ever gotten a computer to work on a

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,190
projector that's pretty good my name is

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,150
information security for taser we'll

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,609
talk a little bit about what taser does

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,529
that has anything to do with privacy and

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,210
cloud and those kinds of things which

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,000
might be new to some of you I'm in

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,520
practicality that means I play C so

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,010

officer all right get to do all those

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,809
things depending on the day in the

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,670
situation taste there's not a huge

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,620
company we have a big name a big brand

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,020
most everyone's heard of but we're not

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,879
gigantic there are about 700 people

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,489
today but growing really fast right

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,289
based out of Scottsdale Arizona have a

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,870
pretty good-sized set of software

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,879
engineers in Seattle and then offices

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,520
all over the world in you know Amsterdam

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,010
London Australia Canada is coming online

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,600
and things like that by the way anyone

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,740
here he doesn't want to work anyone here

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,869
work in law enforcement have anything to

29
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,200
do with the law enforcement world okay

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
good so a lot of this will be new and

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,950
hopefully interesting to everybody

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,259
anyone been tased before yeah was this

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,240
was this a controlled hazing or like a

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,970
wild friday night controlled that's

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,619
unfortunate the wild friday nights are

36
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,710
much better stories they really are I've

37
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,060
been tazed Greg have you done it yet

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,939
what so quick introduction Greg Hughes

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,979
over here is our manager of trust and

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,869
compliance so all the things I'm going

41
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,670
to talk about the actual work is done by

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,710
Greg and his team and somehow you

43
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,570
haven't been tazed yet okay interesting

44
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,219
all right I'm going to try and get this

45
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,579
thing to work

46
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,649
yeah just second so the reason it wasn't

47
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,300
working there was because microsoft

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,980
office just popped up all the updates

49
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,230
that i need to apply it's a feature

50
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,330
feature it's good it's comforting to

51
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,120
know that updates come though right

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,430
absolutely um as you know in the US

53
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,810
certainly but even in other places

54
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,550
around the world law enforcement is

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,070
under a lot of scrutiny right now right

56
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,750
a lot of people looking very closely at

57
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,700
how law enforcement goes about their

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,070
business how they handle you know

59
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,840
sensitive or tough situations with

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,270
certain folks that they deal with and

61
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,430
this is made exceptionally transparent

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,690
to everyone because we're all walking

63
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,530
around with cameras right anytime I mean

64
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,360
imagine in any kind of a downtown

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,000
situation anywhere around the world if

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,620
there's an escalating altercation

67
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,600
between law enforcement and the citizen

68
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,440
what happened with everybody else doing

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,989
boom pull out the phones right you got

70
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,030
all sorts of video going on and of

71
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,260
course those videos get used in all

72
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,549
sorts of different ways they get sent to

73
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,560
the news they become evidence they get

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,780
edited and put up on YouTube and who

75
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,310
knows what right so a lot of scrutiny

76
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,590
for law enforcement you can pick your

77
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,760
incident right there's incidents that

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,350
happen every day there's some really big

79
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,610
international ones that everybody knows

80
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,489
about well taser one of the things that

81
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,709
that we're trying to play a role in is

82
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,430
to help law enforcement police

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,010
communities be a positive force in our

84
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,410
communities through technology right

85
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,910
there's a lot of different lifted things

86
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,010
that need that we need to to do to solve

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,360
this problem but technology is a

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,980
critical part of it and two technologies

89
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,860
that taser has been working on lately

90
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,850
that we think are helping this problem

91
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,470
or first the less less or non-lethal

92
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,930
tasers that everybody knows about right

93
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,820
certainly in an escalating situation if

94
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,680
you can stop somebody from being

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,630
aggressive or attacking you without

96
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,700
having to shoot them with a gun well

97
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,620
that's a good thing right so that's what

98
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,010
the Taser non-lethal weapons aims to do

99
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,950
then there's also the body cameras right

100
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,269
anybody know if they're local law

101
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,190
enforcement in their areas already using

102
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,589
body cameras right so it's grown

103
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,910
going very fast that part of our

104
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,010
business that taser is growing extremely

105
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,470
rapidly right there is a lot of interest

106
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,180
in body cameras all over the world from

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,740
all law enforcement agencies if they're

108
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,479
not already using it they're looking at

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,070
it if they're not already doing a trial

110
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,280
on it or they're already doing RFP so

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,229
taser was the first probably the first I

112
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,180
think very very close to the first

113
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,280
company to come to market with body

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
camera for police officers interesting

115
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,940
story for how we even got there was we

116
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,169
first started putting cameras on the

117
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,330
bottom of the tasers right way back in

118
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,419
two thousand and six seven everybody

119
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,830
would get sued every time somebody was

120
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,500
tased right somebody gets tased the

121
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,639
officer that pulled the trigger gets

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,740
tazed gets get sued the police

123
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,630
department gets sued and taser gets sued

124
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,150
and then the neighbor across the street

125
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,560
that happen to witness that gets sued to

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,900
all right so everybody got sued so

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,919
today's your thought well how can we

128
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,419
help them how can we help demonstrate

129
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,729
that these these capabilities these

130
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,340
weapons are being used effectively and

131
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,570
in the right way and in the right

132
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,639
situations well why don't we put a

133
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,530
camera on the bottom of the Taser so

134
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,199
that started happening in two thousand

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,169
2006-2007 problem is that only captured

136
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,180
once the trigger was pulled all right

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,380
you pulled the trigger and then it shows

138
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,610
what happened afterwards it didn't show

139
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,830
anything about what escalated the

140
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,300
situation to the point where they had to

141
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
use force in the first place so that

142
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,440
gave rise to the idea of well can we

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
make cameras small enough to put on

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,780
officers so that they can see the entire

145
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,520
interaction that they had in any

146
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,169
situation where they had to use force

147
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,400
they had to make those difficult

148
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,889
split-second decisions so taser started

149
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,590
working on body cameras for officers in

150
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,860
about 2007-2008 and first came to market

151
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,139
with him in 2009 and if you remember

152
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,010
back when did the first iPhones come out

153
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,330
anyone November an iphone one what year

154
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,810
was that seven six or seven right so

155
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,729
making a camera small enough to fit on

156
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:10,680
an officer's body in two thousand six or

157
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,110
seven was not like a given right like it

158
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,090
is today right technology wasn't quite

159
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,700
there so even the ones in 2009 that were

160
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,250
first released didn't sell at all

161
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,650
because they were big they were clunky

162
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,570
the officers are like I already have

163
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,360
like a whole army of equipment on me I'm

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
not going to wear that thing right it

165
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,250
was big but the concept was there right

166
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,070
so took a few more

167
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,930
years to refine the technology to become

168
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,580
small enough and light enough and have a

169
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,380
long enough battery life to actually be

170
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,050
useful in a real law enforcement

171
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,240
situation for an entire shift right and

172
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,610
they'll started to sell 2011-2012 and

173
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,560
then something really big happened in

174
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,410
2014 that really threw the body cameras

175
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,910
into the into the public consciousness

176
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,920
and then the market took off anyone

177
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,740
remember that one Ferguson right

178
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,380
Ferguson Missouri was 2014 serious

179
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,030
situation happens where there is no

180
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,400
video right there was no video of what

181
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,170
happened so everyone's wondering like if

182
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,060
we had video what would have happened in

183
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,680
that situation there's no way to know

184
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,540
how that situation would have been

185
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,130
different if there was video but we can

186
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,680
tell you that in similar situations

187
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,110
since then where there has been body cam

188
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,630
video even when it clearly showed that

189
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,370
the officer did something terrible and

190
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,130
was completely in the wrong the public

191
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,310
angst and the riots didn't occur right

192
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,130
interesting kind of kind of a social

193
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,860
social science going on there we're even

194
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,540
where the officer absolutely did

195
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,300
something wrong if there's video of it

196
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,950
that shows clearly that the officer was

197
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,900
wrong and then the public sector the

198
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,400
police department the chief can take

199
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
responsibility for it right away the

200
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,080
braai 'it's and the angst and the anger

201
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,050
does not seem to bubble up quite as much

202
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,820
right we've seen that a not need lots of

203
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,260
examples that I won't have time for

204
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,730
today or that it's happened and

205
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,340
certainly in situations where where the

206
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,350
officer was in the right and most

207
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,300
reasonable people would agree yeah in

208
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,590
that situation I would have pulled the

209
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,840
trigger as well that video show and

210
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,970
everyone can see that the riots and the

211
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,250
angst and the anger don't don't happen

212
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,530
right so a lot of positive coming out of

213
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,710
body cameras to help shed the truth the

214
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,840
light on a certain situation so that's

215
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,860
what tasia has been doing for the last

216
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,960
few years now what that means with all

217
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,860
these body cameras all over the world is

218
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,020
they have to store and manage all of

219
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,140
that video data that video evidence no

220
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,560
small task for an individual officer

221
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,580
it's about one gigabyte per day a video

222
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,380
per shift right so they don't worry

223
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,549
they're not recording everything

224
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,250
generally they usually turn it on / /

225
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,080
interaction then turn it off at the end

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
of it at the end of the interaction

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,730
that usually leads to about a gigabyte

228
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,090
of per data per day per officer so for

229
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,520
normal sized police department of 150

230
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,710
officers that's 56 terabytes of video

231
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,000
per year even just storing that amount

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,530
of video and managing that about a video

233
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,170
is a huge stretch for most law

234
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,660
enforcement agencies most law

235
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,860
enforcement agencies are not big

236
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,540
organizations they do not have dedicated

237
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,330
IT staff they maybe have one police

238
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,150
officer that does i.t stuff they try and

239
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,800
leverage the tech know that the

240
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,870
technology is provided by the county or

241
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,880
the city or things like that they're not

242
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,100
really equipped to manage that amount of

243
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,800
data year-over-year constantly because

244
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,870
it's not just about storing it think

245
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,840
about the life cycle of a body cam video

246
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,030
you have to add metadata to it what's

247
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,070
the category who is involved what's the

248
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,710
GPS coordinates and all those kinds of

249
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,230
things well do we keep it forever does

250
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,880
it have a life cycle what if it has to

251
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,110
go to court what if it needs to be

252
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,300
reviewed by the chief what if we need to

253
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,390
redact it what if we need to go on and

254
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,560
on and on there's a whole bunch of

255
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,540
features and life cycles that happen

256
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,460
with these videos that no law

257
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,570
enforcement agencies can be able to

258
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,450
build the tools and the technology to do

259
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,610
that for themselves and I can

260
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,830
confidently say no law enforcement

261
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,240
agency because we're currently doing

262
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,980
business with and have as our customers

263
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,480
the biggest police forces in the world

264
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,630
the LAPD the London Metropolitan Police

265
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,480
some big agencies in Australia have

266
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,550
determined on their own they have huge

267
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,990
IT departments like it does not make

268
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,850
sense for us to build our own storage

269
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,670
mechanisms and custom applications to

270
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,410
manage the lifecycle these body cam

271
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,960
videos it just doesn't make any sense so

272
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,340
what tasers developed is a thing called

273
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,520
evidence calm cloud-based digital

274
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,650
evidence management system for all

275
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,630
digital evidence mostly body cam video

276
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,700
right now mostly from our cameras but it

277
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,380
is equipped and ready to go to ingest

278
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,260
digital evidence from any source

279
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,270
competitors body cams dash cameras from

280
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,390
the cars CCTV right which is which is

281
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,640
all over a lot of places interview room

282
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,940
audio in the field crime scene photos

283
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,900
etc etc all digital evidence managed in

284
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,240
the cloud questions so far I'm kinda

285
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,310
we're tasers at and what we're doing in

286
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,899
the cloud with body cams and things like

287
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,940
that stories clear so far all right good

288
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,260
okay who would want to hack police stuff

289
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,420
right so imagine now we've got probably

290
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,020
over 5,000 customers over 5 petabytes of

291
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,140
police video data in evidence com which

292
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,089
is growing rapidly I don't know how far

293
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,529
out it is but we'll be adding you know a

294
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,180
petabyte per quarter and then a petabyte

295
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,220
per month here pretty quickly because

296
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,440
it's the ramp up of body cameras around

297
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
the world is it's a steep curve it's

298
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,640
happening quickly so who would want to

299
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,980
get to that data right these are these

300
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,209
are the people that keep me up at night

301
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,880
these are the folks that I worry about

302
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,399
hacktivists servant sort of anonymous

303
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,100
yeah they like to hurt police any way

304
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,050
they can hurt police right they're very

305
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,720
conflicted by the way about taser

306
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
because they hate the police and taser

307
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,130
sell stuff to the police so taser must

308
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,880
be bad but putting cameras on officers

309
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,709
is a good thing to show all the bad

310
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,630
stuff to police do and taser sells the

311
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,330
cameras so then tasers good and so they

312
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,709
have a hard time dealing with us they

313
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,899
don't want I don't know but at any given

314
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,250
moment they probably hate us for

315
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,130
something and so we do get a lot of fun

316
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,870
times with anonymous pretty regularly

317
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,880
one example I'll give this was this was

318
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,760
fun for my team Mesa police department

319
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,160
this is all been in the news Mesa police

320
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,329
department in Arizona had an

321
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,130
officer-involved shooting right a very

322
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,839
unfortunate situation where i think the

323
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,850
officer has actually been indicted and

324
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,610
that's going through the court system

325
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,320
the grieving widow of the guy that was

326
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
killed so the guy that the officer shot

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
a couple of days later not that many

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,050
days later the grieving widow of this

329
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,079
guy goes on the local news in arizona

330
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,480
live on the news and says i need to see

331
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,790
what happened in this video i need to

332
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,899
see what happened to my husband

333
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:46,610
anonymous i know you can get to those

334
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,680
kinds of things the videos in evidence

335
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,220
calm please go get that video okay my

336
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,860
team was excited about that that was all

337
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,079
right whoo we didn't want to sleep this

338
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,959
weekend what okay so that kind of stuff

339
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,550
happens right hacktivists don't like law

340
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,350
enforcement pick an incident if it's on

341
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,360
video body cam it's probably in evidence

342
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,089
calm we got to worry about those guys

343
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:09,260
organized crime where you can imagine

344
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,990
situations where you have video of a you

345
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,980
know a mob boss

346
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,100
or someone who's involved in organized

347
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,019
crime the video that's going to convict

348
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,269
him is that is in evidence calm if they

349
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,190
can get that video tossed somehow by

350
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,589
creating doubt about its veracity

351
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,120
they're going to do that and they have

352
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,740
money to spend so they'll pay really

353
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,240
talented hackers a lot of money to go do

354
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,180
that nation state intelligence we're an

355
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,440
international company we have

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
international clients so some of our

357
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,980
clients are really worried about Chinese

358
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,779
intelligence some of our other clients

359
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,639
are really worried about the National

360
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,949
you're the NSA for the US all right so

361
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,510
we need to worry about like how involved

362
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,240
are nation state intelligence even

363
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,130
though it's law enforcement data right

364
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,050
are they going to try and

365
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,070
surreptitiously get access to some of

366
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,010
this stuff even though they could easily

367
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,389
go through the legit channels through

368
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:58,010
law enforcement right so we worry about

369
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,230
that and then of course even predatory

370
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,630
traders maybe not something everybody

371
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,730
deals with it as a public company be

372
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,050
really really good way to make some

373
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,560
money too short taser stock caused a

374
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,570
massive you know data breach of evidence

375
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,570
calm make money right so those are the

376
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,360
kinds of things that we worry about but

377
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,620
that's all security that's all

378
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,160
traditional tactical security that at

379
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
least I grew up doing that I've done

380
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,300
most but what about privacy right are

381
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,250
there more are there different kind of

382
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,839
privacy things that we need to worry

383
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,250
about with law enforcement data in the

384
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,810
cloud that are a little outside the

385
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,940
normal security scope and certainly

386
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,990
there are and we're going to talk about

387
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,990
some of those one thing I want to point

388
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,550
out is that I don't think that we could

389
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,500
possibly Greg and I and our small team

390
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,310
could possibly tackle the scale and

391
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,920
scope of privacy concerns and

392
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,630
regulations that we need to worry about

393
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,370
globally with all our customers unless

394
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,769
there were standards out there right

395
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,660
unless we have partners like Microsoft

396
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,569
having evidence common as your that are

397
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,010
already tackling those standards

398
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,540
ensuring that the infrastructure that we

399
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,010
use is already compliant with those

400
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,899
standards that we can build on right i

401
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,839
can imagine trying to convince every

402
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,670
individual customer around the world

403
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,370
that were have good strong practices

404
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,839
around the privacy of their data without

405
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,410
something like iso 27001 an accepted

406
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,699
privacy standard that we can be

407
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,500
certified to that they understand and

408
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,850
everyone has to do all these audits

409
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,579
within US law enforcement there's CJIs

410
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:25,950
the

411
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,500
terminal justice information system has

412
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,640
a security policy that says that any law

413
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,440
enforcement data of which evidence com

414
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,200
holds a lot needs to meet the set of

415
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,760
security standards and there's privacy

416
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,230
standards within the cjis policy as well

417
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,700
right we couldn't possibly go to every

418
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,710
single individual agency improve it over

419
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,940
and over again right we need some

420
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,100
central mechanism where we can certify

421
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,630
ourselves to a standard that they accept

422
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,960
certainly we also do ISO 27001 we're

423
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,820
working on FedRAMP for the federal

424
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,830
government I should I should mention

425
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,600
that's not up here is we're also just

426
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,240
finishing up the cloud security alliance

427
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,000
the star star certification level two so

428
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,990
the actual the actual audited

429
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,580
certification level for that which i

430
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,350
think is a fantastic standard for cloud

431
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,450
providers and we're actually I spend a

432
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,770
lot of time trying to convince our law

433
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,200
enforcement customers around the world

434
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
that they should use something like the

435
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,020
CSA as their standard for cloud

436
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,730
providers because one interesting

437
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,070
element that we deal with is we are the

438
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,250
first major application or system of

439
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,620
theirs that is cloud-based law

440
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,450
enforcement around the world as is

441
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,090
natural likes to keep things close where

442
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,650
they can control it and see it and smell

443
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,510
it and touch it so putting their data in

444
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,700
the cloud is a big step for most of our

445
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,130
customers around the world in order to

446
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,810
help them get over that step now the

447
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,190
same time they realize they can't do

448
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,110
this video body cam thing without going

449
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,970
to the cloud so we're the first major

450
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,530
provider that's kind of helping them get

451
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,240
over that hurdle and realize the

452
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,790
benefits of the cloud so having

453
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,740
standards like the CSA and things like

454
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,930
that help us a lot we can point to like

455
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,220
we're not just doing this ourselves this

456
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,170
isn't taser making it up all right these

457
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,819
are internationally accepted standards

458
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,530
that all the big boys like Microsoft are

459
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,480
doing that we're helping to protect your

460
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,099
data so more specifically what are some

461
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,190
of the the privacy questions and

462
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,380
concerns that we get from law

463
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,970
enforcement that we have to try and

464
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,900
answer so I'm going to go through their

465
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,560
questions to talk about how we try and

466
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,180
meet their requirements or questions

467
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,240
about privacy specifically privacy

468
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,820
privacy and compliance of their data so

469
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,630
one who owns my videos right anybody

470
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,160
else here work for a company that runs a

471
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,919
cloud service

472
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,970
yeah do you have to deal with that

473
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,950
question with your customers like who

474
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,539
owns the data when I put in your cloud

475
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,360
who owns the data that yeah the customer

476
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,759
should but how clear is that to the

477
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,460
customer right is it absolutely crystal

478
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,139
clear to the customer is it in the

479
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,259
contracts is it absolutely ironclad as

480
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:00,419
you can possibly make it that the

481
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,190
customer still owns the day that you're

482
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,470
just a custodian you're just a rented

483
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,470
hand to help do some things right that

484
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,690
needs to be my mind that needs to be

485
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,190
super crystal clear ladies to be very

486
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:18,419
transparent right yeah oh man you're

487
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,009
hitting all the good stuff yes I was

488
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:21,059
going to get to that we'll talk about it

489
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,509
now we have this additional nuance where

490
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,529
our customer is a law enforcement agency

491
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,879
it's easy for us to make it clear that

492
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,489
they own their video data right in the

493
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,220
video data were just a custodian but

494
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,379
what about the additional privacy

495
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,379
considerations for the public the people

496
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,779
in the video the citizens of that

497
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,299
community right those kinds of things I

498
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,129
can tell you right now it's not it's not

499
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,289
clear right that varies by state that

500
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:50,759
raised by jurisdiction that varies by

501
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,249
country that is a very nuanced and

502
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,679
difficult question answer right what

503
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,869
we're trying to do though is to make

504
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,789
sure that we build in the technologies

505
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,669
within evidence calm and our body cams

506
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:05,789
to be able to satisfy whatever is

507
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:08,369
decided within a community right we may

508
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,999
have some countries or customers where

509
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,710
where the video is law enforcement and

510
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,269
no one else is allowed to see it and

511
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,489
it's that law enforcement agency justice

512
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,960
aside everything that happens to that

513
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,330
video okay we need to provide the access

514
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,789
controls and the audit trails and all

515
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,169
those kinds of things to satisfy that

516
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,330
need we may have other countries

517
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,600
customers jurisdictions where the person

518
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,129
in the video has a right to see that

519
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,169
video whenever they want to see it they

520
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:36,659
because they're in the video therefore

521
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,450
we need to provide tools to be able to

522
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,100
help our customer the law enforcement

523
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,679
agency produce that video give it to the

524
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,230
requester what if it's a mass requests

525
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,359
it needs to be done bulk right that's

526
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,399
not a small technological task so we

527
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,200
need to be able to support

528
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,179
that workflow in jurisdictions where

529
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,100
that's what they've decided to do right

530
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,880
because as you might as you might

531
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
imagine there's a different answer to

532
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
that question all over the world we're

533
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,799
just trying to make sure we build the

534
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,120
technologies that can satisfy it

535
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,980
depending on who it is and where it's at

536
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,990
did that answer that question yeah I

537
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,190
guess we'll talk about redaction that

538
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,269
down at the bottom I already have it on

539
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:18,299
there who can see my videos okay so yeah

540
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,559
I'm putting this video up in evidence

541
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,250
calm but who's who who can see it who

542
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,750
could go watch that video if they wanted

543
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,519
to and how what trust do I have what

544
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,830
proof do I have that only the people

545
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,320
that I want to see that video can see

546
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,820
that video or actually do see that video

547
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,870
right so certainly we have to build in

548
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,610
audit mechanisms and audit trails and

549
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,260
things like that to be able to

550
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,289
demonstrate to a customer that the only

551
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,570
people that even can access access that

552
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,860
video are the people that you have

553
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,139
authorised whether that's through the

554
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,760
access control systems that we give you

555
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,870
and you pick the roles and the

556
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,710
provisions and who can do what or in the

557
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,690
interest er the rare cases where we have

558
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,880
some administrators on the back end that

559
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,010
theoretically could go look at videos if

560
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,679
they needed to and we in honestly we do

561
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,029
have a couple right we're not an

562
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:08,970
infrastructure provider where we can run

563
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,529
the hardware and never have to access

564
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:12,779
the data right we're a software as a

565
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,460
service provider so our people are

566
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,919
writing the code dealing with the actual

567
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,450
video is being stored in the databases

568
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,100
and the metadata in the databases right

569
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,630
we're a little bit closer to it than a

570
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,419
Microsoft or naww s so we do have a few

571
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,639
people that if they really needed to

572
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,799
could get into those storage areas to

573
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,240
fix things in which case they could

574
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,490
access video so how do we provide

575
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,830
transparency to our customers about who

576
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,830
those people are and how we control and

577
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,490
protect that access right so what we

578
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,559
provider are pretty standard contractual

579
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,840
things that says we'll give you the list

580
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,190
of who those people are we'll do

581
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,500
whatever vetting and clearances that you

582
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,110
require us to do for those few people

583
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,779
and then our internal security team has

584
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:57,029
these specific monitoring checks and

585
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,639
audit trails to watch and demonstrate

586
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,559
whenever that that is done whenever that

587
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,870
access is used it was for a legitimate

588
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,549
purpose and we can tell you what that

589
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:06,139
purpose will

590
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,159
right so we have a lot of controls

591
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,590
around that unfortunately what that

592
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,139
means for those few administrators that

593
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,399
actually have that level of permission

594
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,859
is they might be the most like security

595
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,529
cleared people on the planet right is

596
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,629
they got to do the US checks for sieges

597
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:23,519
we've done some Canadian checks for

598
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,799
Montreal what else are we working on

599
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,349
some of the UK stuff and a few others

600
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:32,429
are coming down the road right yeah good

601
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:33,629
question subpoenas do I have that up

602
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:36,090
there I'm going to cover that under who

603
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,649
has the right to request my videos yep

604
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,839
yep so don't let me forget to talk about

605
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,469
subpoenas into that okay so regardless

606
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,629
of who can see my videos who actually

607
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:48,960
has seen my videos who has viewed it

608
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,169
downloaded it shared it those kinds of

609
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,269
things alright so we have built into the

610
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,339
system to try and address that concern

611
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,839
pretty robust audit trail to allow the

612
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,729
customers see exactly everything that's

613
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,109
ever happened with the video from the

614
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:06,450
time it was uploaded who looked at it

615
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,190
who downloaded it who shared it who

616
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,129
viewed it all the details they might

617
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:12,599
even need to show in court about chain

618
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,979
of custody for everything that happened

619
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:15,659
to a video but even for an internal

620
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,849
investigation right just to see like

621
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:20,039
well who who wasn't that shared this

622
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,349
video with with the prosecutor that

623
00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:24,330
maybe we shouldn't have or who was it

624
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,399
that download of the video when we

625
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,869
didn't want it to be downloaded and

626
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:32,820
things like that I think my mind I think

627
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,499
this is a transparency feature that has

628
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:37,589
to be more prevalent in cloud solutions

629
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:40,200
right really robust and deep audit

630
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,570
trails so you can see who exactly has

631
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,849
done what with with the data yeah you're

632
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:46,830
trusting the cloud provider to do to do

633
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,200
a lot of work for you but that doesn't

634
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,190
mean that you need to give up the

635
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,450
ability to see what it is they've done

636
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,299
for you you should still be able to see

637
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,070
all those details and we're able to

638
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,979
satisfy a lot of privacy concerns in the

639
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,359
countries we work in because we do have

640
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,460
this robust audit trail where they can

641
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,379
see the deep level exactly who has done

642
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,239
what with any individual piece of

643
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,759
evidence we do have some some kind of

644
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,659
funny stories where for example a

645
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,950
prosecutor shows up in court they should

646
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,259
have viewed the video ahead of time they

647
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,790
show up in court and they

648
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,880
say you know yes or no no your honor I

649
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,190
haven't seen the video I haven't had a

650
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,840
chance to review it yet and right in

651
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,970
court they can the priest officer could

652
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,770
pull it up and say well actually the

653
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,940
audit trail shows that you watched it

654
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,910
four times yesterday right that happens

655
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,380
occasionally then people get they get

656
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,480
the idea all right evidence com has

657
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,730
audit trails that's different than when

658
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,040
the video is on a DVD you can see

659
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,860
exactly what happened where is the data

660
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,060
stored so it's already it's been talked

661
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,530
about a bunch already today on the data

662
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,690
sovereignty concerns and we certainly

663
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,220
run into that very frequently where in

664
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,230
the world is the data center the

665
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,820
application residing with that data

666
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,770
stored is an important question for our

667
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,530
customers one sometimes there's there's

668
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,350
actual legislation legal requirements

669
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,390
around it but even when there's not

670
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,000
there's actually very real kind of

671
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,980
political considerations around that

672
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,510
when it comes to law enforcement data

673
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,490
right who wants to be the police chief

674
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,170
in a country that's just starting to use

675
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,180
cloud that has to explain to your

676
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,850
Parliament that I'm putting all of our

677
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,060
body cam videos on servers in the US

678
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,110
even though there's no law against it

679
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,360
even though I'm completely confident

680
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,190
that the security of that system is

681
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,640
top-notch no police chief no

682
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,170
Commissioner wants to be the person to

683
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,050
try to explain that to their Parliament

684
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,730
right so there's a very real political

685
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,380
considerations for this data sovereignty

686
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,410
as well so much like Microsoft we've

687
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,060
taken the strategic step that yeah we're

688
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,730
going to keep data in the countries in

689
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,230
the countries of the regions where those

690
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,850
customers are that's what we're going to

691
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,680
keep the data and we certainly leverage

692
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,150
infrastructure partners like Microsoft

693
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,530
that are having these data centers these

694
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,000
Azure deployments all over the world in

695
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,640
order to do that right so UK data stays

696
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,200
in the UK Australia data stays in

697
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,020
Australia Canada stays in Canada us

698
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,310
stays in the US etc with some

699
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,270
regionalization I think I forgot who was

700
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,760
a dimension that that it's going to

701
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,800
settle out and it won't be every country

702
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,360
having their own clouds but there will

703
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,710
be some regional clouds like we've been

704
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,450
successful in convincing New Zealand

705
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,670
that it's okay to use the Australian

706
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,890
region right that's kind of kind of not

707
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,930
a big deal right in Europe we'll see how

708
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,440
that works out questions up to this

709
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,660
point

710
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,490
well one interesting thing we deal with

711
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,800
on the on the where is the data stored

712
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,080
is where does the person sit who

713
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,300
administers the system all right so one

714
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,890
thing we still do is we still have our

715
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,310
top system engineers they handle the

716
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,340
tier 3 problems our US citizens and they

717
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,560
sit in the US we do have some systems

718
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,390
this admin work that happens or steel

719
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,680
sales engineers and stuff like that that

720
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,080
work in the regions but we still have US

721
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,490
citizens in the US they have to

722
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,020
administer the Australian system in the

723
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,660
UK system and the candidate system so

724
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,700
far that's worked out right we've been

725
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,230
able to convince them that the controls

726
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,410
that we have in place ensure that the

727
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,640
data is still not being pulled into the

728
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,470
u.s. even when they go do some of that

729
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,990
administration in those regions and

730
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,550
we'll see over time how well that

731
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,890
continues as we continue to grow

732
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,730
certainly once we hit a certain size

733
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,890
will probably be similar to the to the

734
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,300
model that Microsoft's taken where

735
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,010
German citizens are running the German

736
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,510
data center I suppose we'll hit the

737
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,770
scale at some point where we may have

738
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,940
something similar who has the right to

739
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,680
request my videos right so as to the

740
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,840
subpoena so in a lot of places that

741
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,160
around the world is certainly in the US

742
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,330
you have these Freedom of Information

743
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,420
Act work right so who can request the

744
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,350
video and who can they request it from

745
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,670
right can a citizen come to taser and

746
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,590
request a video from evidence calm

747
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,390
through a Freedom of Information Act

748
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,030
request well our stance would be no

749
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,490
please don't do that right that should

750
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,680
be through your local jurisdiction right

751
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,050
through the law enforcement customer who

752
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,360
to which those laws apply and then we

753
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,010
build the technical mechanisms that

754
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,600
allow them to actually provide that

755
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,330
video when that legal FOIA request comes

756
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,670
in right so far so good that works out

757
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,980
pretty well well what about subpoenas

758
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,650
right what happens when you have you

759
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,900
know a subpoena from a citizen or from

760
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,490
one law enforcement jurisdiction to

761
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,180
another to get the video again much like

762
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,950
Microsoft our stances that's not our

763
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,210
video to give away that's not our

764
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,570
subpoena to respond to that needs to go

765
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,630
to the owner of the data right so so so

766
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,220
far so good all the subpoenas have been

767
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,260
routed to the actual law enforcement

768
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,510
agency that owns the data and they

769
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,770
handle how they handle it and if they

770
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,460
need to provide

771
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,440
they can access evidence calm through

772
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,789
all the normal mechanisms and provide

773
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:50,710
that video and that's how we've done it

774
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:58,320
so far questions up to this point yeah

775
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,380
so we have we have not yet had a

776
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,020
subpoena that I'm aware of asking us for

777
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,600
the data we make it very clear in our

778
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,220
agreements and anytime there's any wind

779
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,290
that there might be a subpoena like we

780
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,790
make it clear do you go to the owner of

781
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,470
the data so I'm not aware that we've

782
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,750
actually received a subpoena yet they've

783
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,940
all gone through the actual owners of

784
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,200
the data the actual law enforcement

785
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,280
agency that's involved yeah yes

786
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:47,839
yeah good question so for those

787
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,579
international customers I mean one we're

788
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,379
in a practicality we really don't ever

789
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:55,279
pull the data across from the region

790
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,690
right our engineers go into that

791
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,949
environment and work on it there the

792
00:29:57,949 --> 00:29:59,989
data is not coming back across to the US

793
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:04,579
in all practical purposes and oddly

794
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,949
enough law enforcement has some

795
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:08,749
interesting carve outs when it comes to

796
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,669
some of these privacy regulations law

797
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:12,679
enforcement data is actually not treated

798
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,259
the same as general PII in most of the

799
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:18,469
countries that we deal with so while we

800
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:19,999
do have to worry about and comply with

801
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,379
those requirements it's usually an

802
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:22,699
agreement between us and our law

803
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,979
enforcement customer as opposed to the

804
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:27,049
general regulation that might apply to

805
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:29,169
the you know the general population PII

806
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,279
so it really is kind of one-off

807
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,989
discussions and agreements in the

808
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:35,119
purchasing process the RFP process with

809
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,909
it with a particular country I guess not

810
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:43,159
in the strictest sense but in a in a

811
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,579
framework wise yes in a sense kind of

812
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,669
like that yeah yep and the only to

813
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,079
honestly the only time that we ever end

814
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,299
up with international data in the US is

815
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,299
when is when the law enforcement agency

816
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:58,159
for example when they have to return a

817
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,379
broken camera and they have to send it

818
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:01,549
to us to retrieve the data off the

819
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:03,649
broken camera which is very few and far

820
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:04,759
between and that's all part of the

821
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,869
contract whenever that needs to happen

822
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:07,999
and we're growing at a rate we're

823
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,139
actually more of that is actually

824
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,429
happening in country we don't have to

825
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:11,690
send it back to the engineers in the US

826
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:18,190
right just it's just a scale thing yes

827
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:29,340
she ain't no no so the question if you

828
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,540
didn't hear was if there is a data

829
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,650
breach this is completely theoretical

830
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,120
who would be responsible for notifying

831
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,940
any of the individual citizens that are

832
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,460
in the videos right interesting question

833
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,880
luckily have not crossed that bridge it

834
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,070
would almost have to be the law

835
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,300
enforcement agency because there's no

836
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,050
way we would know who is in what video

837
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,270
right we would know which video belongs

838
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,280
to which law enforcement agency there's

839
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,080
no way we would know who is actually in

840
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,480
what video so that would have to be up

841
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,650
to the individual law enforcement

842
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,840
customer to do that now of course we

843
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,790
have agreements about how quickly we

844
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,320
need to notify any customers of any

845
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,300
potential breaches so hopefully that

846
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,820
would be a relatively quick process but

847
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,990
if it was a large amount of data that

848
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,540
would not be easy to go figure out

849
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,460
exactly who's in what video maybe the

850
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,380
specific subject they would know but if

851
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,670
there's ancillary folks in the video

852
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,559
that's going to be tough yes

853
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,700
correct so which made the data is

854
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,889
attached to a video is largely up to the

855
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,629
decisions of the of the law enforcement

856
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,610
themselves right our system provides the

857
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,049
ability to attach a bunch of different

858
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,580
metadata elements everything from just

859
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,529
tagging and then the tags I can put

860
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:51,730
whatever they want they can have their

861
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,980
own custom tagging situation GPS

862
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,980
coordinates the category for the type of

863
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,409
incident it was all those kinds of

864
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,330
things are built into the system what an

865
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,220
individual agency decides to put into

866
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,159
that metadata system is up to them right

867
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,929
they may be putting they may be putting

868
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:09,250
people's names and addresses and stuff

869
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,710
like that chances are not really because

870
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,690
what usually happens is they have a

871
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,000
records management system already right

872
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,649
that records management system was what

873
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:19,419
contains criminal you know criminal

874
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,639
history information exact what happened

875
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,990
in an incident who is involved in an

876
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,299
incident and stuff like that they just

877
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,909
attach or link up the video to the

878
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:30,220
records management system so the

879
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,480
metadata around the video is pretty

880
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,830
minimal and all the details are in the

881
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,649
records management system in most cases

882
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:37,809
right but again like we don't you know

883
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,039
we're not at the level of detail but

884
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,360
we're watching exactly what metadata

885
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,370
each customer's doing by providing we're

886
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,110
providing that capability and they use

887
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,919
it how they will yep all right other

888
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,009
questions these are good questions all

889
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:54,730
right and finally how can I redact my

890
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,519
videos you can imagine scenarios happens

891
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,919
every single day over and over again

892
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,179
where a legitimate Freedom of

893
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:02,769
Information Act request is made for a

894
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:05,590
particular video or set of videos there

895
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,570
is an onus usually in the law where they

896
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,280
need to redact certain parts of that

897
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,859
video before it can be released publicly

898
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,929
right either there's minors or there's

899
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,989
license plate numbers or people not

900
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,310
related to the incident in the

901
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,399
background and things like that so how

902
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,290
can I redact that video becomes a really

903
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:27,699
big privacy question right and the onus

904
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,159
of meeting that privacy obligation is on

905
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,989
our customer who in turn then is

906
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,839
requiring us to build sophisticated

907
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,918
technologies to enable them to do that

908
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:41,859
efficiently right I mean if you're doing

909
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,319
it the hard way would be frame by frame

910
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:45,369
right imagine taking two

911
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:48,489
was a video multiply that by 10 or 20

912
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,829
and going frame by frame to blur out a

913
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:53,049
face well that's not going to scale

914
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,609
that's not going to work and in fact if

915
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:55,839
that was if that was the way it was

916
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,569
today a lot of body cams would not be in

917
00:34:58,569 --> 00:34:59,890
the streets police departments would say

918
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,019
I can't do it we can't deploy body cams

919
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,779
and capture this video because I will be

920
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,359
swamped with redaction requests that we

921
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,339
cannot fulfill therefore we're not going

922
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,890
to do body cams so it's on us to try and

923
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,930
provide robust redaction technologies

924
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,809
and tools so that that public purpose

925
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:19,150
can still be fulfilled and still meet

926
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,099
the privacy obligations so we're working

927
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,809
hard on making it as automated as

928
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:25,119
possible current state of the art is

929
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,799
object recognition like here's a head

930
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:28,990
and we can follow the head around in the

931
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,259
frame and keep it redacted not quite

932
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:34,240
facial recognition yet you still have to

933
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,950
go back and view it make sure it didn't

934
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,630
you know mess things up in a few places

935
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,339
and clean it up but it's still a lot

936
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,319
better than it was but it still needs to

937
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,630
get better right there good true

938
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,700
automated redaction is going to be

939
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,859
critical to the wide adoption of body

940
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,380
cameras and videos because there is

941
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,089
there is in most countries and most

942
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,450
locales a public right to these videos

943
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,400
in certain situations but there also has

944
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,200
to be this privacy constraint or certain

945
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,680
things are redacted all right that's all

946
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,739
of the big topics I wanted to cover got

947
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:06,970
you out a little bit early unless

948
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,349
there's like a half an hour worth of

949
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:17,109
questions just waiting said a hand

950
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:18,999
raised no it's just uh if you want to

951
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,470
dig into any of the details for how

952
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,610
we're doing some of this greg's your guy

953
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,960
okay i'm actually just curious about

954
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,690
your role in the organization he said

955
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,180
you're the siso yep but you're talking

956
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,100
about a lot of product features how are

957
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,410
those d play on both sides the product

958
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,690
development and in the organization yeah

959
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,610
it's a great question so what role does

960
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,890
the security team play in product

961
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,280
development right luckily a Taser we're

962
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,420
in a position where we play a big role

963
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,100
in product development which isn't

964
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,150
always the case I worked with other

965
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,620
companies but that's a hard thing to do

966
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,510
for the sea so to get into the product

967
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,640
and make sure privacy and security

968
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,920
features are built into the product not

969
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,750
so a Taser they recognized early on when

970
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,700
they brought me on board that that we

971
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,530
need security expertise in the product

972
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,570
developed lifecycle in order to sell

973
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,220
these products like trust is a huge

974
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,540
thing we won't be able to sell these

975
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,040
products unless there's really strong

976
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,010
robust trust so a part of my team spends

977
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,530
a lot of time doing threat modeling on

978
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,570
product features certainly with you tons

979
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,490
of pen testing on the products we look

980
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,690
carefully at various features of

981
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,670
products to you know make suggestions on

982
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,860
on how we can help support privacy

983
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,750
regulations actually in the products

984
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,180
right so we do spend a lot more time in

985
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,680
the product available life cycle than

986
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,020
then probably a lot of companies have

987
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,280
their security and privacy teams

988
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,070
actually do which is interesting

989
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,350
refreshing and also like terribly time

990
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,860
consuming all at the same time yeah

991
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,770
I see videos on Facebook all the time

992
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,110
where the faces are redacted so I just

993
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,430
assumed it was an app you can download

994
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,980
is it is it a significant thing to

995
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,170
redact so yes it's a significant thing

996
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,550
Facebook actually probably is

997
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,380
state-of-the-art right now on facial

998
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,630
recognition and image processing and

999
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,850
redaction they're not giving us their

1000
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,270
technology a shocker and there is a

1001
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,830
fundamental difference that's not

1002
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,470
obvious for most of that video versus

1003
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,360
body cam video when you have a

1004
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,080
stationary camera and it's HD and the

1005
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,090
faces stay pretty much in the camera you

1006
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,170
can actually do pretty good facial

1007
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,110
recognition now put the camera on a body

1008
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,600
and it's bouncing around and there's

1009
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,460
people moving all which ways and it's

1010
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,770
not full HD necessarily all of a sudden

1011
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,560
facial recognition doesn't really work

1012
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,640
right so is an interesting distinction

1013
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,900
when you see some of the cool fancy

1014
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,820
facial recognition yeah they're not yet

1015
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,830
doing that with body cam video right

1016
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,120
that's bouncing all over the place and

1017
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,770
officer running down the street and all

1018
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,330
that kind of stuff yeah

1019
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,880
yes here's our contracted some ginger on

1020
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,770
the engines but that's a product or

1021
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:27,910
international yep so evidence calm body

1022
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,070
cameras is a very new thing in law

1023
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,380
enforcement so certainly with the bigger

1024
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,500
agencies this this is a custom

1025
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,880
negotiated contract almost every time

1026
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,390
when you're talking about LAPD's and the

1027
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,829
London Metropolitan Police and certainly

1028
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:44,680
the first big agency in a country right

1029
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,940
we're helping to figure out the

1030
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,470
contractual language for that region

1031
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,780
with those first few customers so it is

1032
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,790
a very laborious individual process

1033
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,609
right now we are making that more

1034
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:55,750
efficient we are becoming more

1035
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,579
standardized I mean Greg correct me if

1036
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:59,079
I'm wrong it is much more standard in

1037
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,359
the u.s. right large diploma in the US

1038
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,410
but pretty much is what it is and

1039
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,329
everyone we meet all the cjis

1040
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:05,859
requirements it's very clear how we've

1041
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,390
done in the US and so the tends not to

1042
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,790
be near as much back and forth we're

1043
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,740
just now having discussions in Germany

1044
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,680
France Italy countries like that

1045
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,609
guarantee there'll be a lot of custom

1046
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,260
negotiations on how the contract is

1047
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,119
going to work in those countries right

1048
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,520
so so a little of both depending on

1049
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,420
where you are yeah yep

1050
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,460
I can describe how tasers work too if

1051
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,390
you really want it but this is more of a

1052
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,860
law enforcement question that there

1053
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,180
might be someone who knows the answer to

1054
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,140
it it seems like it's not really easy to

1055
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,360
get a police report even if you are

1056
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,040
named in the police report not that that

1057
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,750
happened by the way that you know but

1058
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,460
but I've just found that out through

1059
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,530
talking with people so so what is that

1060
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,340
what is the law looked most like local

1061
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,380
laws or what is they law about getting

1062
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,360
video your video of yourself that's been

1063
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,250
you know that the police owns for one

1064
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,460
reason or now so I actually don't know

1065
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,710
the difference between like a police

1066
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,560
record that has you in it versus a

1067
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,710
police video that has you in it as far

1068
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,570
as the request laws work i'm sure it's

1069
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,090
different in every state i just know

1070
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,820
that it is a regular and onerous thing

1071
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,250
for people to request videos so i don't

1072
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,150
know if that's because the law is

1073
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,340
different or if it's just more

1074
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,680
interesting to request videos but that's

1075
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,910
certainly happening a lot nowadays yeah

1076
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,660
video

1077
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,250
vacations from statutes like Information

1078
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,530
Act with the California Public Records

1079
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,730
Act where's the police report considered

1080
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,520
a public record because there's a public

1081
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,869
interest in knowing who was arrested

1082
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:04,520
okay interesting very good

1083
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,589
yep

1084
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:21,309
yep and that's right that's like ongoing

1085
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:24,140
law right now in discussion and it's in

1086
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,400
a different place in every jurisdiction

1087
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,400
around the world on you know what's

1088
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,249
allowed what's public was not public

1089
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:33,380
it's quite a discussion now in a lot of

1090
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,539
states on with when police are wearing

1091
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,819
body cams okay they're out on the street

1092
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,410
this is happening we all get that what

1093
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,140
about when they need to walk into a home

1094
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,700
ok this is the privacy requirements

1095
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,529
change when they need to walk into a

1096
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,719
home well we're as taser we're not

1097
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,859
getting involved in what the law should

1098
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,719
be right that's a public policy

1099
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,460
discussion but we're watching it closely

1100
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,170
because we may need to build features

1101
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,960
and capabilities into the cameras to

1102
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,249
take into account the difference between

1103
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:00,829
out on the street and in the home all

1104
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,619
right so there's and dealing with a

1105
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,089
minor versus an adult and the whole

1106
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:12,799
thing yep John on the impact police body

1107
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,719
cameras on domestic violence where in

1108
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:16,369
some states they found I believe in

1109
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:19,880
Arizona that when police are wearing

1110
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,499
body cameras in investigating domestic

1111
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:22,999
violence situations to actually have a

1112
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,469
higher success rate in the prosecutions

1113
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:28,700
typically because the culprits plead

1114
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,650
guilty on the basis of the video

1115
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,069
evidence are more likely to plead guilty

1116
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:37,579
yeah they're in places around the world

1117
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:40,099
that don't have the law enforcement

1118
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:41,690
trust issues that we have in the US

1119
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,549
they're still deploying body cams

1120
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:46,400
because they're fine far better rates of

1121
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,190
convictions for things like domestic

1122
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,019
violence and things like that so there's

1123
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,059
a number of different use cases for body

1124
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:55,099
cameras beyond just transparency and

1125
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,749
police behavior and it's pretty

1126
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:58,069
interesting to see which parts of the

1127
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,900
world are adopting them for what reasons

1128
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,789
yeah good any final questions or you're

1129
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:06,829
done you made it through the day it's

1130
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:09,440
time to end it all right I think we're

1131
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,310
done Jeff

1132
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,460
thank you
