1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,779
I'm going to very briefly introduce Greg

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,510
Brown of Microsoft who is he has an

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,800
official title here which is on the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,309
board senior director strategy for Sela

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,109
corporate standards group sealers

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,690
they're basically their legal in-house

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,750
shop but in reality what Greg is like

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,980
Microsoft's standards guy who drives the

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,750
development of all of the standards work

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,660
internally and you know

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,210
well knows a lot about this yeah we'll

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,950
moderate that first of all let me thank

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,820
people for coming back from the break

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,860
some of you left your stuff which was

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,149
very encouraging but you know it's

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,180
always a bit dodgy I am going to talk a

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,610
little bit about standards which to me

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,680
are a deep passion but not to everyone

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,250
sometimes so I am what I'd like to do is

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,079
speak for about a half an hour and then

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,420
because of my role at Microsoft I do get

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,520
some insight into our sort of operations

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,319
and compliance and things like that and

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,080
we'll leave some time open for questions

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
not only prompted by what I'm gonna say

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,260
but but other questions about how we do

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,290
things in operations so I'll hold the

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,479
questions till then but I am open to

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,780
sort of visual signals you know as

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,580
subtle as having your forehead hit the

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,380
table or something like that I'll I'll

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,830
try and change in what I'm doing as I go

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,369
along so our group there are a lot of

34
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,890
people who do standards inside Microsoft

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,759
we connect to a ton of other products we

36
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,040
have devices that have USB ports and

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,180
things like that we do a lot of

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,880
standards work our group focuses on

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,829
international standards standards that

40
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,939
are both basically voted on by nations

41
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,170
created by technical experts and then

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,420
voted on by nations and we're really

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,759
lately been focusing on standards that

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,509
deal with security and privacy and the

45
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,189
cloud so we have it there is some

46
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,250
narrowing of my scope but our team works

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,320
on the submissions into the

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,179
international standards effort what what

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,730
do we draft to suggest would be a good

50
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,990
idea and as you may know this time

51
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,330
process the international levels very

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,070
slow it's a couple of three four years

53
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,020
for a standard and some of that is a

54
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,700
very high value because they get vetted

55
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,970
very deeply and they get voted on by the

56
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,680
experts but then they get voted on by

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,690
the national standards bodies of all the

58
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,120
nations and so they carry with them some

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,910
benefits they're like for example it's a

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,730
per se not a non-tariff barrier to trade

61
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,070
to quote an international standard so if

62
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,180
you have a if you have a an RFQ and you

63
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,390
say you have to support ISO 27001 in the

64
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,170
RFQ it's not it's not considered a

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,600
barrier to trade around the world right

66
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
you're allowed to do that kind of things

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,570
but that means they looked at very

68
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,280
carefully it takes a long time to do it

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,590
so I'll be focusing mostly on on

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,380
international standards and we'll talk

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,480
about these kinds of topics what's the

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,490
role of standards how does it work with

73
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,950
privacy I want to introduce you to some

74
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,670
standards that are bubbling up for you

75
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,880
to think about and maybe participate in

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,400
and then we'll we'll talk a little bit

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,910
about what's coming up next okay so what

78
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,470
are the roles for standards and

79
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,480
particularly international standards and

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,420
we tend to focus on them in two separate

81
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,400
ways one of which is as the basis of

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,770
certification basis of third party

83
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,800
audits okay and the second one is a way

84
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,640
to increase transparency to allow people

85
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,980
to be using the same terminology the

86
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,870
same structure of thought the same

87
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,570
economies in order to be able to

88
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,720
communicate both of those hope to

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,310
demonstrate are critical for the

90
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,230
upcoming complexity of conversations

91
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,600
we're going to have about privacy right

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,820
we'll start with certification for a

93
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,370
little bit you know there's in

94
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,560
international standards and ISO level

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,840
standards there's a chain between

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,330
there's actually three or four parts to

97
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,149
a certificate there is a standard upon

98
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,370
the standards somebody makes a scheme an

99
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,279
audit scheme and then there's an actual

100
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,250
audit process and then they issue a

101
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,440
certificate and for an international

102
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,540
standard all of those elements

103
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,810
are regulated by the national bodies so

104
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,450
if you have the British Standards

105
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,400
Institute come out and do an audit there

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,590
are an accredited auditor by the British

107
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,780
government and you will notice that on

108
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,460
some of those certificates there will be

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,980
the Queen's mark on it just like you

110
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,840
know an Altoid or something else but

111
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,390
that this is comes from the Queen so

112
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,060
these have a certain provenance of of

113
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,070
what you're allowed to do and not do in

114
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,750
those certificates but there are all

115
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,160
those elements you can take a standard

116
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,190
and create another scheme against it

117
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,400
CSA does this takes 27001 expands the

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,820
scope and creates another scheme of

119
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,580
auditing that we use as some a 27001

120
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,920
does some new things with it as well so

121
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,110
all of those elements are in place but

122
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,060
the key part of that is you can do a

123
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,170
third party audit the second one and and

124
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,010
there are two parts to that in the 27001

125
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,800
world there's a standard that says

126
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,140
here's how you should do things here's

127
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,880
how you should think about risk here's

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,790
how you should build a process that will

129
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,640
allow you to be risk enabled and then we

130
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,550
mentioned 27,000 18 which is a specific

131
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,130
set of controls that said for cloud

132
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,490
service providers acting as processors

133
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,110
we want you to want to tell us why

134
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,450
you're not doing these controls right so

135
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,580
put in your state but your statement of

136
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,290
playability why you're doing or not

137
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,930
doing so you can have narrower cases

138
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,830
that you can audit against transparency

139
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,350
we want to be using the same language

140
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,550
the same semantics the same meanings in

141
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,110
order to communicate some difficult

142
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,970
concepts and I'll talk about those

143
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,870
standards in a little bit so one thing

144
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,790
we talked about somebody has to great

145
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,020
question about boundaries and scopes and

146
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,080
when you go to a cloud service provider

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,670
it's worthwhile for the kind of

148
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,200
practitioners that are sitting in front

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,510
of me in the audience to go look at the

150
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,670
actual services that you're going to buy

151
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,710
and see which actual certificates are

152
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,350
against those scope of services I

153
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,060
pictured here our

154
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,450
our broader services with our strongest

155
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,000
set of certificates on it but if you for

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,650
example the extreme case take a beta

157
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,310
product it may be out of scope we just

158
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,610
bought LinkedIn LinkedIn services I'm

159
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,590
sure they have some stuff but I'm sure

160
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,380
I'm not sure it's 27001 certified to our

161
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,410
level yet so you will see from Microsoft

162
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,480
these services and this is the highest

163
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,640
level these services have these

164
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,320
certificates about it and that's worth

165
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,570
looking at right that means they being

166
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,620
certified and they've gone through

167
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,780
things now how do we do all of those as

168
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,690
we you know I for once this is my first

169
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,370
presentation without the set of logos

170
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,270
but how do we do all of those

171
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,450
certificates

172
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:31,030
well Microsoft participates in beginning

173
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,360
in the external process we work with the

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,470
definition of standards we have I think

175
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,090
a very good communication with NIST

176
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,520
about what should happen in FedRAMP they

177
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,590
listen and they do whatever they want to

178
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,280
do but they do listen but so we work on

179
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,620
standards to try and condition them to

180
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,900
make them realistic to what we think is

181
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,990
happening in cloud and then internally

182
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,090
we do a business process that says which

183
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,400
customers want which certifications how

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,260
much market will it open up what does a

185
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,900
kid who cares about it and determine on

186
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,600
a set of certificates and then as Doug

187
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,410
mentioned we go look to see what

188
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,510
controls do we already have in place

189
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,669
that we can do a control equivalency

190
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,060
mapping to and what new controls come in

191
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,630
place and phrase and that applies the

192
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,130
standards of course applies to

193
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,710
everything else so GDP are we are in

194
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,530
active daily conversations right now

195
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,169
pouring through GDP are saying okay are

196
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,909
there new obligations in there that we

197
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,950
are not covering in this service that we

198
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,990
have to add new controls in in order to

199
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,710
do that's an accumulative process office

200
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,140
365 has around 900 controls in the

201
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,430
control set right now 2/3 3/4 of those

202
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,370
are active can

203
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,910
okay and then when an auditor comes the

204
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,030
process is to say okay these controls

205
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,020
are equivalent to the controls in socket

206
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,810
two these controls are equivalent of the

207
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,870
controls in in FedRAMP here is our

208
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,660
control evidence will you go through the

209
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,790
control evidence checked we're running

210
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,160
the process check the controls and give

211
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,810
us the certificate so we do not have a

212
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,540
whole twenty seven thousand one set and

213
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,460
then a full FedRAMP set and then a full

214
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,460
SOT to set it is a combined set of

215
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,930
certificates it's the only way we can

216
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,740
manage this death and realistically you

217
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,650
know this there are new threats so there

218
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,630
are new things you can do but after a

219
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,160
while there's only so many ways you can

220
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,710
secure a system right I mean you're

221
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,060
doing everything you know how to do

222
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,040
right and so until a new threat comes

223
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,050
and you go close the barn door after

224
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,090
that particular horse in case there are

225
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,860
any more horses you put a new control in

226
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,990
place you start to asymptotically

227
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,180
approach what you can do all right so

228
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,870
that's how we handle it today but I will

229
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,490
tell you that I think we as an industry

230
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,200
our customers are driving us this way

231
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,300
particularly our sophisticated customers

232
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,250
are moving to a post certificate world

233
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,690
where they no longer perhaps in the

234
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,910
early stages of evaluating a service or

235
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,100
deciding well is this something I even

236
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,930
want to investigate as a potential in

237
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,940
the in the solution design phase or

238
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,840
something they look at the certificate

239
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,740
bases but usually their risk management

240
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,120
organization wants to see the actual

241
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,030
control evidence and we are moving more

242
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,600
and more to the point where and this is

243
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,710
something called the it's not the TSP

244
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,580
now what's called Service trust portal

245
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,920
Service trust portal where you will be

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,830
able to get the evidence that we

247
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,690
provided the auditor against the

248
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,790
controls so you can go look at the

249
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,490
evidence directly and that's one of the

250
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,830
ways that our customers can talk to

251
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,020
their regulators by doing evidence

252
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,880
layering they can say okay our

253
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,160
responsibilities are this our cloud

254
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,190
service providers

255
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,840
here's the evidence they provide here's

256
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,550
our evidence and provide that package

257
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,070
and go get their own audits or

258
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,560
certification but we're moving out of a

259
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,570
world where the certificate is enough

260
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,060
into a world where there is a lot of

261
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,820
evidence that the cloud service provider

262
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,510
is gonna give the customer it's good

263
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,090
news because it's transparent it's bad

264
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,490
news because there's a lot of stuff and

265
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,130
how did you know that you asked for all

266
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,860
the right stuff right so one of the

267
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,750
standards that the standards community

268
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,400
is has worked on in order to sort of

269
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,980
respond to this issue of how do you

270
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,900
organize all of the evidence that you

271
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,840
need to think about is cloud service

272
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,810
level agreement framework fondly known

273
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,550
as one 908 six and that was developed

274
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,610
it's being work developed worldwide came

275
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,250
from two routes one from NIST and

276
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,680
another one from the European Commission

277
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,450
sets of documents merged pulled together

278
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,600
and when you really look at it it's a

279
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,590
due diligence checklist for the cloud so

280
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,390
when we when we're thinking about this

281
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,000
hard we said how do we avoid a symmetry

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,740
of information between the cloud service

283
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,750
provider and the customer so you can

284
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,700
make a fair deal right so somebody can

285
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,980
actually make a deal and know what what

286
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,000
happened what should they look at and

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,210
that standard this is a checklist that

288
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,530
is derived from that standard that

289
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:38,440
standard will be published November has

290
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,320
elements in it of for example cloud

291
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,839
service customer data define cloud

292
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,230
service customer data and usage terms

293
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,830
how do you use cloud customer data

294
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,000
commercial services the answer is almost

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,530
always well for our services we don't

296
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,950
use it for anything but the provision

297
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,650
and improvement of the service and we're

298
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,000
going to talk more about that but we

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,650
have a very limited scope of how we use

300
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,960
customer data but it also talks about

301
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,750
account data derived data other classes

302
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,950
of data and we'll talk about that a

303
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,920
little bit

304
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,649
but how is data use good data location

305
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,019
where is the data stored where is it

306
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,699
processed where did it go in transit

307
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,499
these are things that you should find

308
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,089
out about when you go through the cloud

309
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,389
service evaluation process and what are

310
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,220
the processes for law enforcement access

311
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,439
so this is about a quarter to a fifth of

312
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:39,019
the elements on the checklist for one

313
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,649
908 6 and it's simply something that

314
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,660
when you're writing an RFP or you're

315
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,329
evaluating a cloud service it's a due

316
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,730
diligence checklist help you organize

317
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,279
all of that evidence and figure out how

318
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,999
to to get it now we're a work running

319
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,949
around in background now that the

320
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:00,860
standards starting to close up saying

321
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,569
how do we organize the information we

322
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,279
have on all our websites and give people

323
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,339
a rosetta stone that is also organized

324
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,439
by one 908 six so we can respond quickly

325
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:11,769
to these requests but this is a way of

326
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,839
communicating between these two that's a

327
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,089
transparency standard so when we had a

328
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,790
good question about we had a couple of

329
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,300
good questions about the data center in

330
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,550
Germany and some of the work we're doing

331
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,740
the US federal government and I had some

332
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,269
great questions about how the cloud

333
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:40,160
works and what you want to do when it

334
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,329
gets right down to it the thing about

335
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,660
the cloud is the cost curve is

336
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,149
extraordinary

337
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,290
so it's 20% the cost to run 10,000

338
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,079
servers as it is a thousand service for

339
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,870
the same unit of work it's a fifth and

340
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,720
it keeps dropping and oh by the way it's

341
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,019
not just 1 over X it's just not

342
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,089
amortization of cost it actually drops

343
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,100
off more rapidly than that 100,000

344
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,170
servers is a lot less expensive again

345
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,730
all right so how do we want to provide

346
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,600
those economies of scale to people but

347
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,139
still maintain data localization

348
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,699
requirements handling requirements

349
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,370
special handling for data well the

350
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,630
secret is to define data probably

351
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,290
right we would like to be able to

352
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,670
process and store locally managed

353
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,759
globally right so if we find a threat

354
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,380
and we want to do an update to servers

355
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,569
we want to propagate update to servers

356
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,750
worldwide without concern right so

357
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,639
there's a whole level of management that

358
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,480
we would like to be able to do without

359
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,639
fettered access you have to talk to

360
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,410
people about that that I gave you the

361
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,930
two really obvious things your data

362
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,610
stored locally you know where exactly

363
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,819
where it is the temperature that comes

364
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,990
off of the server racks that we monitor

365
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,730
you don't care right I should be able to

366
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,399
pull that from Germany or Washington DC

367
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,250
or Beijing nobody cares but in the

368
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,569
middle is where the interesting

369
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,889
conversation is about data end user

370
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,199
identifiable information

371
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,339
organizationally identifiable organized

372
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,829
information that we may want to work

373
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,540
with around the world to improve our

374
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,759
services you may consider confidential

375
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,100
how do we talk about it

376
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,130
$1.99 for four is a technology that's

377
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,990
probably q3 next year and a summer next

378
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,439
year

379
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,279
which is a taxonomy of data types for

380
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,930
cloud data you know I'll show you a

381
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,910
taxonomy picture there's that this

382
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,310
button either gives me a laser or ends

383
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,870
the world alright this is a big red dot

384
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,409
so this is literally the taxonomy of

385
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:09,659
data so for example customer content for

386
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,569
all of you who have a been working on

387
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,179
gdpr and thinking about it here are four

388
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,730
new entries that came in just recently

389
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,289
into the standards development process

390
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,750
personal genetic data biometric data

391
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,209
data of children political opinions

392
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,640
financial details starting to segment

393
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,230
out the data that is specifically

394
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,049
addressed as sensitive data and the GDP

395
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,240
are so people can talk about it right

396
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,520
these are a taxonomy of data types so

397
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,590
people can talk about data use and

398
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,760
that means we should be able to build an

399
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
agreement right a contract that says we

400
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,430
treat all customer content this way

401
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,570
right we only use it for this however

402
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,490
your account data which is specifically

403
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,410
about your payment instrument data we

404
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,420
can work with worldwide can we agree to

405
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,010
that so we're not just saying where's

406
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,260
the day you know bird data we're talking

407
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,900
about specific elements of data and the

408
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,710
standard also allows for the creation of

409
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,530
very specific data use statements and

410
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,030
I'll click through this quickly if

411
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,380
anybody wants to talk to me afterwards

412
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,390
I'm happy to go in more detail but it

413
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,720
basically says I'm gonna say I'm gonna

414
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,910
qualify by how linked it is to an

415
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,230
individual I'm gonna say a data type

416
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,530
from somewhere is used by something to

417
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,140
do something that results in something

418
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,990
else it's a structured statement that

419
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,390
allows you to write a sentence like

420
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,610
aggregated telemetry data from this

421
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,680
capability is used by this service to

422
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,740
improve the CSP services and every term

423
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,830
in red is defined in the standard so you

424
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,960
can put that statement in the data use

425
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,030
statement and somebody can go and find

426
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,330
out quite precisely what do you mean by

427
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,230
that okay

428
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,010
and so this is there's two versions of

429
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,540
it a passive voice and an active voice

430
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,230
it's an international standard this

431
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,330
allows you to write very very precise

432
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,300
data use statements in short form but

433
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,610
that boiled down to actual commitments

434
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,220
and we're you know as we get more

435
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,870
complicated use of data we think we're

436
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,040
gonna have to communicate more

437
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,320
specifically with customers we're very

438
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,000
excited about this standard as a result

439
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,100
another standard in the same mode that

440
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,490
is in development I'm gonna answer a

441
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,380
question you haven't asked her haven't

442
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,930
asked me yet what keeps me up at night

443
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,580
this is a standard for describing

444
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,100
de-identification techniques by their

445
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,340
characteristics and the kinds of attacks

446
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,820
that they will withstand

447
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,160
it doesn't tell you how to do the

448
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,340
identification right it simply helps you

449
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,250
describe the identification if any of

450
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,940
you and I presume many of you have have

451
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,460
been trying to explain to people what

452
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,770
sued anonymization doesn't mean almost

453
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,750
anonymization okay it's not like it's

454
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,700
like pseudo anonymization and so those

455
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,590
techniques though even in documents as

456
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,080
seriously the gdpr are bandied about

457
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,420
without real understanding of what do

458
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,340
you mean of the injection of pseudonyms

459
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,020
for direct identifiers z' is what I

460
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,480
would call sued anonymization it's not

461
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
exactly the use in in a lot of documents

462
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,730
so this standard says here is a taxonomy

463
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,920
of data-id identification techniques

464
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,640
judged by their characteristics and for

465
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
Excel when you describe to a regulator

466
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,840
you can say I pursued this technique I

467
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,150
my goals were to defeat these kinds of

468
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,600
attacks I used these kinds of inputs

469
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,480
then I designed my process why is this

470
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,110
so one of the ones that's out here at

471
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:16,290
the end is a framework Cris logic

472
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,670
framework maybe I've got an old data but

473
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,400
is of differential privacy what keeps me

474
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,620
up at night at night somebody asked a

475
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,130
good question about is this a trend

476
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,770
towards it's things like our data German

477
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,860
data center a trend towards Microsoft

478
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,210
removing itself from the data so it

479
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,920
doesn't have direct attached to the data

480
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,710
the answer is is yes that is a trend

481
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,650
many of those techniques that keep us at

482
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,140
arm's length for the data are extremely

483
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,840
difficult to understand differential

484
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,330
privacy blockchain heavy encryption

485
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,040
just-in-time processing these are things

486
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,600
that are critical to our trust with

487
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,460
customers very difficult for people

488
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,550
writing policy to understand and so this

489
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,250
standard takes differential privacy and

490
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,290
says here's the goals here's the

491
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,020
limitations here's how it might be used

492
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,030
it helps define that so again it's a

493
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,680
transparency standards just a way to

494
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,960
talk about these and I would encourage

495
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,850
you you know when you're you're thinking

496
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,440
about designing the identification

497
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,390
systems try and get a draft at this

498
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,090
standard or even join us and work on it

499
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,010
as it goes forward so we can do a better

500
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,650
job of describing very precisely what we

501
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,850
mean by the identification by the way

502
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,360
the data qualifiers that were in the

503
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,930
data use statement are linked closely

504
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,330
with the identification standard those

505
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,040
two standards are linked so if you've

506
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,730
described the data as unlinked or sued

507
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,950
anonymized over here you can go look at

508
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,390
the other standard exactly what do I

509
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:55,310
mean to get that so the ties together so

510
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,630
in the end that's what we're trying to

511
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,710
accomplish in this aspect of

512
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,630
transparency standards and certification

513
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:09,740
standards in in AI so if you look at the

514
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,340
classic relationships in a protection of

515
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,390
PII there is a controller of course the

516
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,340
controller has some relationship with a

517
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,420
cloud service provider the controller at

518
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,500
least is under the observation of a PII

519
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,420
authority I think with gdpr

520
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,560
the processor is has more direct

521
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,720
obligations maybe indirectly talking to

522
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,480
the DPA but at least the controller is

523
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,180
talking to a DPA and these standards

524
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,230
help in 199 44 for example help that

525
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,630
controller describe here is the data and

526
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,600
here is how I am using it to that to

527
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,970
that authority we are very interested

528
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,220
again in allowing governments to write

529
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,250
their own laws but when it comes down to

530
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,320
sort of not their own facts right so

531
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,290
when it comes down to the specific

532
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,110
technical performance that you or we are

533
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,540
supposed to do have that defined by

534
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,880
international standards so that when

535
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,830
they say soon Animas ation we all know

536
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,929
what it means when

537
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:20,659
say provide the service we all know what

538
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,210
it means and we what's really expensive

539
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,769
for us if there is a different

540
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,419
definition of provide the service in

541
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:27,950
Germany than there is in France and

542
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,740
there is in the UK because we are then

543
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,539
constant and every time we make an

544
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,639
enhancement to the system we have to

545
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,340
check all of those definitions so the

546
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,080
specific technical performance run by

547
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,690
standards is our goal so that's an

548
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,990
important transaction same thing with

549
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,440
the communication with the data subject

550
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,669
which is tougher the standards there is

551
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,450
nobody posting photographs on facebook

552
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,419
that is read iso 29 100 to understand

553
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,210
what their privacy rights are nor will

554
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,539
they read one nine nine four four but if

555
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,429
there was an iconography created as

556
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:10,399
described in the gdpr that iconography

557
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:12,169
should be based on a fixed language of

558
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,600
use it might be based on a standard down

559
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,470
at the end and then the critical one of

560
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,980
course for us is the relationship

561
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,480
between the cloud service provider in

562
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,499
the pii controller and then there are

563
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,369
certification standards like twenty

564
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,740
seven thousand eighteen you must or

565
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,070
explain why not codes of practice and

566
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,389
then there are descriptive standards

567
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:38,509
like one 908 six tell me everything you

568
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:40,369
did that's relevant to our relationship

569
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,190
or 199 44 tell me in detail everything

570
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,230
you did with the data we're gonna write

571
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,360
a contract on the basis of that and that

572
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,009
will be a much better contract for us

573
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,299
over time and then finally the cloud

574
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,549
service provider itself defines itself

575
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,950
all of the NIST terminology is now being

576
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,840
put in international standards so we can

577
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,509
use it so the excellent presentation we

578
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,789
had on how data how the cloud is

579
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,950
structured all that's based on

580
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,330
international standards so we can go

581
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,440
forward okay so what would I love to

582
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,799
have you do well at least review 199 for

583
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,580
for when it comes out this November and

584
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,080
provide feedback directly to anybody

585
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,879
involved in ISO you can provide it back

586
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:24,980
to me or anybody else but also think

587
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,129
about using it actually I used the wrong

588
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,859
number there it's the wrong number one

589
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,850
908 sick

590
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,100
the SLA standard is coming out in

591
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,800
November when that comes out start using

592
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,900
that to communicate with us and other

593
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,640
vendors about your desires for

594
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,920
information about the cloud and then

595
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,260
participate or at least review these new

596
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,540
transparency standards to see how

597
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,430
they're going to fit in the sort of

598
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,800
quiver of tools we have for for

599
00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:00,190
transparency okay so with that questions

600
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,340
Thank You piata cracksman State Farm

601
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,890
Insurance I did not realize that there

602
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,380
are so many techniques for D

603
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,080
identification are you able to provide a

604
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,450
high level description for me what's the

605
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,310
difference between di identified data

606
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,260
and anonymize data

607
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,040
sure I'll tell you what the standard

608
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,600
says all right so did we pick the

609
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,630
identification as an umbrella term for

610
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,190
all the techniques underneath

611
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,810
anonymization is defined in the standard

612
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:42,560
as you have now reduced the data is no

613
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,970
longer in the form of what you would

614
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,160
call Micro data it is no longer a line

615
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,440
item of data related to an individual

616
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,720
even if you've removed the linkage

617
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,620
between that individual and a real

618
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,710
person it's possible to reaiiy denta fie

619
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,870
them if you have enough individual line

620
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,340
item so anonymize data now removes

621
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,170
aggregates the data together or adds

622
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,420
enough noise to the data so that you can

623
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,580
no longer detect a single individual in

624
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,790
the data it's a bad recitation what's in

625
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,860
the standard all of the other techniques

626
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,200
suit anonymization techniques which are

627
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,670
also called the identification

628
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,490
techniques take either direct or

629
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,490
indirect identifiers Gregg is a direct

630
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,980
identifier okay lids in on Queen Anne in

631
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,260
Seattle is an indirect identifiers you

632
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,480
start removing those that's levels of

633
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,000
pseudonym ization I'm adding usually you

634
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,530
replace it with a number or something a

635
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,080
pseudonym so that's a little bit of a

636
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,000
difference but you you should have a

637
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,899
look at the standard

638
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:50,840
lays that all out you cannot put it back

639
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,879
together you cannot put it back together

640
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:55,370
and the thing is you cannot put it back

641
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,029
together

642
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:58,639
to a guarantee and that's another thing

643
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,049
the standard talks about so there are

644
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,789
techniques in an autumn is a ssin that

645
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:05,360
say you can kind of put it together but

646
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,169
you'll never know with more than the

647
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:11,240
least you can get to is five people with

648
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,220
the same data it's called KN anemone

649
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,440
right so there will be no fewer than

650
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,720
five people that you can't tell amongst

651
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,210
right so there are different kinds of

652
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,639
attacks that people do right do they

653
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,889
want to find a senator out of the middle

654
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,230
of a set of medical records or do they

655
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,159
just want to find people who are likely

656
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,669
to have a disease and they don't care if

657
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,049
they're not precisely right they're

658
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,149
gonna stand to adds to them that's a

659
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,440
different kind of attack so there are

660
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,179
different kinds of attacks that you put

661
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,100
on the data different techniques in the

662
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,440
standard maps between those so at least

663
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,119
when you go talk to a regulator say this

664
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,649
was the attack I was trying to prevent

665
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,019
and this is the technique I used the

666
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,789
regulator can say okay that that's the

667
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,259
attack we care about and that technique

668
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,289
is reasonable one okay okay so that's I

669
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:02,320
don't know if that's an answer but okay

670
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,409
yeah we went through a and I skipped the

671
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:09,980
data portability standard but that was

672
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,929
three hundred to three hundred pages of

673
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,639
standardized standards on the numbers I

674
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:16,330
gave you so far

675
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,570
yeah are these traps all available and

676
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:27,630
where can we find them yes and no the

677
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,450
notorious online ISOs door well yeah the

678
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,120
notorious iso standard ah they go

679
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,190
through a dark period so like 1 908 6

680
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,809
right now you can't see because it's

681
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,220
about ready for publication

682
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,039
the other ones yes we can get drafts for

683
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,539
people who are interested in reviewing

684
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,039
or participating in the in the

685
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:53,490
standardization yeah at work we are

686
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,500
always getting surveys and they say this

687
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,380
is completely anonymous when you reply

688
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,360
to the survey and they want to know your

689
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,730
opinion on different things and they're

690
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,019
using things like Survey Monkey

691
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,919
sometimes so it makes me not be

692
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:09,710
completely assured that they're using

693
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,789
anonymization like you're describing

694
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,139
did you tell can you tell me what do

695
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:15,659
they usually use they're usually using

696
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,179
some form of what we what the scanner

697
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,669
would call secure pseudonym ization so

698
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:26,460
they take your data they replace it with

699
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,090
an ID and then they do what they call

700
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,460
fuzzy ID right so they take the the

701
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,330
number and add noise into the pseudonym

702
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,950
so it's it's quite hard to reify you

703
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,750
however it's not resistant in the attack

704
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,909
that said well give me everybody who had

705
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:47,880
these 5 answers to the singling out

706
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,639
attacks that would not be be easy to do

707
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:53,190
with that data and part of the problem

708
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,590
we've had with the identification in

709
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,899
general is we've used terms like

710
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,799
anonymous I think this famous Netflix

711
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,470
prize example where they said this data

712
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,190
is anonymous and the academic applied

713
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,710
one attack to it singled out some data

714
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,899
and said no it isn't and therefore

715
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,330
nothing can be truly anonymous right

716
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,299
that's one attitude the other attitude

717
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,720
is hippos approach to soothe

718
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,529
dynamization

719
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:26,669
it's quite basic I mean it takes the

720
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:28,630
direct identifiers out essentially

721
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,060
we really have not had a significant

722
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,150
difficulty with with re-identified

723
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,060
medical data right so it works it really

724
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,530
helps it's much better than not doing

725
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,520
anything and that's one of the things

726
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,390
that we really want to make sure is that

727
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,400
companies do apply the identification

728
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,560
techniques as part of their improvement

729
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,970
of their protection of PII

730
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,000
even though academically it's possible

731
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,500
that it's not completely anonymous so

732
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,810
it's not a waste of time and it's a

733
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,490
being a funny debate because people have

734
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,470
not used the terms what they mean is

735
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,830
your data is soon autumn eyes and not

736
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:14,710
anonymized sorry more questions perhaps

737
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,090
on that somewhat reassuring note thank

738
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,620
Greg for his
