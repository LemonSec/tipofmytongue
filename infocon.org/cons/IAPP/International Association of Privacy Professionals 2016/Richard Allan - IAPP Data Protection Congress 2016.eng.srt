[Music]

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,099
good morning and it's a pleasure to be

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,120
here this morning talking about

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,150
something that's important that isn't

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,130
current politics that the only silver

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,770
lining I found from the brexit episode

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,380
is that now I'm a call upon expert

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,119
within the company for dealing with

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,810
shocking surprising and in some cases in

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,910
most cases unwelcome election results

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,230
thinking about what I won't talk about

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,090
today I thought the important thing

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,430
would be to reflect on some of the

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,110
learnings that we have had as a company

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,390
as Paul said I think we're a company

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,399
very publicly has faced an enormous

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,390
amount of scrutiny for what we've done

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,670
in relation to our compliance model in

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,559
the way that in particular we've rolled

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,410
our privacy policy updates over time I

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,420
want to share some of that learning with

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,460
you because I think it's particularly

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,559
timely right now as actually our first

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,239
speaker said as more and more of the

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,080
devices that we use start to become

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,250
devices that are in some way connected

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,080
with the use of personal data so in

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,380
other words the need for a broader range

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,080
of products and services to think about

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,640
their privacy policies think about how

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,159
they're going to explain to the people

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,520
using that service their use of data

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,720
that's important and then also in the

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,939
context of the general data protection

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,290
regulation which I'm sure there are

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,939
large numbers of people in this room

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,520
right now who are spending time figuring

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,740
out what updates if any they need to

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,840
make to their policies in the context of

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,079
the new regulation so what I wanted to

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,320
in particular think about whether the

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,720
regulations that we have and the ways in

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,970
which we comply with them help people in

44
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,159
the way in which they're intended to be

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
looking at that that specific example in

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,380
the EU we've defined privacy as a

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,270
fundamental right and we've also in the

48
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,049
European Convention on Human Rights

49
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,360
articulated a view that privacy again is

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,329
a core human right but this doesn't need

51
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,520
translating into practical regulation so

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
we have the core right but there's

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,510
practical regulation that's given effect

54
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,380
previously through the

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,840
or currently through the data fiction

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,460
directive as transposed international

57
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,250
law and soon through the data protection

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,470
regulation and when we translate that

59
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,960
fundamental right into a regulatory

60
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,780
framework we need to do it in a way

61
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,480
where it doesn't cause paralysis there

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
is no intention I think when you define

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,170
something as a fundamental right for it

64
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,630
to prevent all kinds of activities that

65
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,310
are actually in the public interest in

66
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,010
the interests of people rather it's

67
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,630
intended to create a framework within

68
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,000
which those activities can take place

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
but at the same time respecting that

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,660
core right I spent some time some years

71
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,050
ago as a legislator new UK Parliament

72
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,030
and one thing stuck out for me was when

73
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,480
we modified our law on communications so

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,310
communications are not a fundamental

75
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,110
right in European Union law but we

76
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,390
needed to give effect of the regulation

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,880
of the telecom sector and we debated for

78
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,090
a long time how we should call the

79
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,560
people whose interests we were

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,910
regulating for there was a debate

81
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,100
between calling them citizens and

82
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,410
calling them consumers quite a

83
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,910
philosophical debate as to whether or

84
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,710
not that would change the way in which

85
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,600
you gave effect to the regulation and in

86
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,850
the end we compromised by calling them

87
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,730
citizen consumer so classic political

88
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,560
compromise for their citizen consumers

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,270
in the regulation but I actually find

90
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,060
that quite a nice phrasing when we think

91
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,910
about regulating businesses in the

92
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,430
context of some of these core rights we

93
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,410
have interests as a consumer and we

94
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,760
shouldn't forget those the interest as a

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,460
consumer primarily other service that we

96
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,620
like and and want to use is able to be

97
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,750
delivered to us but we also have broader

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,390
interests of citizens there is a sense

99
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,040
in which rights like the right to

100
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,040
privacy have a broader societal impact

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,110
than simply the right of me as the

102
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,300
individual use of a consumer I'm so

103
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,430
thinking of people our as citizen

104
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,370
consumers and then thinking about how we

105
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,550
can give effect to those I would say

106
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,250
complementary interests through

107
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,769
regulation brings us to look again and

108
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,260
saying does a privacy policy does the

109
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,450
way in which a service interact with its

110
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,210
citizens consumers accurately capture

111
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,979
their interests and develop their

112
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,280
interests

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,300
one of the other core values that we

114
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,620
have at face because we like to think

115
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,200
we're at learning culture so the classic

116
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,020
thing that we do is we do something it

117
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,390
doesn't go the way that we expected we

118
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,430
learn from that and we don't repeat the

119
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,730
mistake but after seven years of the

120
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,830
company and having issued multiple

121
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,350
privacy policy updates for multiple

122
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,930
products I can't yet say that we've got

123
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,150
to the stage where we can now launch

124
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,860
privacy policy update and nothing will

125
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,400
happen

126
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,230
it'll be simply a sort of routine

127
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,169
business there's clearly some challenges

128
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,060
still around that we've tried many

129
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,010
things and again I'm sure people here in

130
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,450
the room who have been through these

131
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,740
exercises we tried briefing regulators

132
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,750
we've tried going out to different

133
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,910
expert groups we've tried a whole bunch

134
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,680
of different things to try and help

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,450
people understand what it is that we're

136
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,010
doing we feel very carefully about

137
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,480
design we thought very carefully about

138
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,000
opt-in opt-out options we worked for all

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,940
of that and yet we still seem to find

140
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,680
ourselves in a repeated cycle where as

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,870
we update the product and update the

142
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,419
service we are causing unhappiness and

143
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,550
that unhappiness gives us no pleasure

144
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,479
whatsoever and I don't mean this is a

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
way of complaint or a wave wind I mean

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,200
this genuinely as a this is a challenge

147
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,820
we're going through this repeated cycle

148
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,820
and huge amounts of effort of very

149
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,710
serious and well intentioned privacy

150
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,120
professionals on our side and one

151
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,060
intention and seriously professionals

152
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,640
out there in the regulatory world a huge

153
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,380
amount of that resources being taken up

154
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,020
in many cases over many many months in

155
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,330
trying to unpick what happened when

156
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,740
we've launched a policy update and that

157
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,080
feels to us not the most productive use

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,940
of resources so if there are ways in

159
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,550
which we can get past that than we would

160
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,830
like to do so and that's one of the

161
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,210
things that we want to explore actually

162
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,010
again with people in this broader

163
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,750
community rather than those just those

164
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,320
who exist within the company so thinking

165
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,750
about why we do these updates I think

166
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,669
there are really three core drivers one

167
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,280
is technology and again in the open talk

168
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,510
we talked about the evolution of

169
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,430
technology just to give you a classic

170
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,479
example if you as we did operate a

171
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,969
traditional website a website has or

172
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,439
traditionally the websites had very

173
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,719
little notion of location they're not

174
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,909
location-based services they're sources

175
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,369
used from a static point when you take

176
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,169
that service and move it on to mobile

177
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,209
and it starts to become predominately

178
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,579
used on mobile platforms all of a sudden

179
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:55,949
you've unlocked a whole range of

180
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,349
location-based services there there's no

181
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,789
reason why consumers shouldn't have them

182
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,619
they're very consumer friendly but

183
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:05,019
clearly as a service you have now

184
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,179
extended your service from a static

185
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:09,099
service to a location-based service and

186
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,829
you do need to go explain that to people

187
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,379
explain why you're doing it explain that

188
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,119
you will now be capturing location data

189
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,459
and using it in certain ways and frankly

190
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,869
if you make those kind of large

191
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,509
technology transitions you can't say to

192
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,949
people I want the version without

193
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,139
location because the service has a whole

194
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,849
has been updated it is now using

195
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,769
location in many ways would be

196
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:32,589
inaccurate to say to people well our

197
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,419
service now uses location but you're

198
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,919
particularly use of it will not involve

199
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,289
involve location the technology has

200
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,269
moved on it is now a feature a facet of

201
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,039
that service so there are technology

202
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,399
changes like that where the platform has

203
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,899
evolved and now offers something

204
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,239
different and the policies must reflect

205
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,459
that difference the second driver a

206
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,369
business drivers and again the most

207
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,929
recent update that we're talking about

208
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,119
they their whatsapp privacy policy at

209
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,269
Davis made a few headlines is is very

210
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,069
much about a business update and again

211
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,949
these are quite normal as businesses

212
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,799
evolve there's no fundamental reason why

213
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,329
a business should not be able to evolve

214
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,549
its business model and equally there's

215
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:14,019
no reason why businesses shouldn't be

216
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,249
able to change their structural

217
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:18,069
configuration because of normal business

218
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:19,959
drivers and that can be entirely in the

219
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,299
consumer interest that once you do that

220
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:23,889
you're able to offer better more

221
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,009
enhanced services that's why these

222
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,089
structures change over time and why

223
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,129
business models change over time again

224
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,860
some people will object to the evolution

225
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,000
the business model but I don't think

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,769
there's any core in principle reason why

227
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,169
that can't happen but when it does you

228
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,759
need to be transparent and explain to

229
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,740
people that the business model has

230
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,019
changed and then I think the last core

231
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,149
drivers regulations I said something

232
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,290
like the general data protection

233
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,420
regulation coming into force will

234
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,800
require everyone to look at their

235
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,060
policies

236
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,529
but there's also a lot of specific

237
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,660
changes and again one of the ironies

238
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,510
from where we say is I again intend as

239
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,010
an observation not a complaint but one

240
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,470
of the ironies is that the outcome of a

241
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,710
regulatory action very typically is a

242
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,480
requirement to put more language into

243
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,490
your privacy policy and often at the

244
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,020
same time has been criticized having too

245
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,000
long a privacy policy you will get a

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,510
requirement to say in sections 3 5 & 6

247
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,250
there's insufficient information it's

248
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,130
not clear therefore I'm asking you or

249
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,860
requiring you and in some form to add

250
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,420
additional language into your policy and

251
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,010
clearly you then need to go and do an

252
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,930
update so again from sitting inside a

253
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,570
company perspective you have a queue of

254
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,370
changes that are being made the

255
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,680
technology is evolving the business

256
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,720
models may be evolving and you've had a

257
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,640
series of interactions with regulators

258
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,160
who have told you that you must make

259
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,290
changes in order to reflect concerns

260
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,800
they have about inadequate or

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,910
inappropriate language in the policy

262
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,710
so those things queue up and at a

263
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,200
certain point after that gestation

264
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,610
you're ready to go and you launch the

265
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,210
princi policy update those drivers I

266
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,589
think are all perfectly natural and

267
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,540
perfectly normal and indeed I think one

268
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,150
of the concerns we have is that because

269
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,800
of the climate that we've created where

270
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,540
these updates are difficult to do I

271
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,400
suspect there are people sitting there

272
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,130
who really should be making updates but

273
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,020
prefer not to do so or they will leave

274
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,330
it as long as they can in order not to

275
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,370
get into one of the kind of cycles that

276
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,310
we've been involved in so those

277
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,470
requirements are there we do need to

278
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,000
figure out how to update them on a

279
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,670
regular basis but I don't think any you

280
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,080
know across the industry we figured out

281
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,630
quite how to normalize this how to make

282
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,000
it so that this is a routine part of

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
business is still seen as something

284
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,089
exceptional that's something surprising

285
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,890
when say from our point of view it's

286
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,040
really quite normal and I think part of

287
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,140
the problem is some of the assumptions

288
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,850
that are made about the purpose of a

289
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,790
privacy policy again I'm sure people in

290
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,260
this room are familiar with the research

291
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,630
done a few years ago by the researchers

292
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,000
at Carnegie Mellon where they looked at

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,230
the amount of time it would take

294
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,300
somebody to read privacy policies for

295
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,920
typical services they used if they did

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,540
that and it turned out to be more than

297
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,790
200 hours a year so we're talking about

298
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,540
five working weeks a year

299
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,190
to read the privacy policies back then

300
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,009
roll forward to 2016 and you're probably

301
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,420
you know you could spend a couple of

302
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,889
months a year actually reading the

303
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,810
policies of all the services that all of

304
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,850
us typically use so it's not gonna

305
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,690
happen

306
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,730
and I think we need to recognize that

307
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,069
the privacy policy fundamentally it is

308
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,279
not a user facing communication it

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,040
exists for them but it is primarily a

310
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,769
legal document that exists to underpin

311
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,019
the service that's there in the case of

312
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,329
dispute and as part of our conversation

313
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,009
with regulators who quite properly want

314
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,779
to check that we're doing things but in

315
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,699
the same way that if I buy a car I don't

316
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,860
read all the safety certification

317
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,110
documents or indeed if I buy a financial

318
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,240
services product I'm primarily going to

319
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,880
rely on brand and trust that all the

320
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,440
underlying compliance work has been done

321
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,970
I think similarly with the services that

322
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,819
we use that sort of formal compliance

323
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,680
mechanism I think people will trust that

324
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,350
that has been done and they're not going

325
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,670
to engage with the detail of the

326
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,560
document in most cases there will be

327
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,089
exceptions to that but most people are

328
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,889
not going to do that I say particularly

329
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:09,680
as as the use of the documents and the

330
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,440
use of personal data is spread so I

331
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,120
think we need to think much more and

332
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,709
focus much more on how we give people

333
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,660
information outside of those policies

334
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,790
and again that's been an evolution with

335
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,529
us and I think is an evolution for

336
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,350
others as well that while we need to get

337
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,819
the legal documents right and do the

338
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:27,199
compliance and we have no complaint

339
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,600
about doing the compliance we want to

340
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
take some of the energy the drive the

341
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,310
expertise of our privacy professionals

342
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,040
and direct them more towards

343
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,600
communicating with people outside of

344
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,430
that privacy policy so that we can help

345
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,860
them to understand what exactly is going

346
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,740
on under the hood how to drive the

347
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,290
product as much as how we did the safety

348
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,500
compliance for the product this may seem

349
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,380
at the moment like a large tech company

350
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,319
problem I mean most of the sort of fun

351
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,880
and games and the attention has been on

352
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,410
updates that have been done like by

353
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,850
companies like mine and similar

354
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,790
companies where we've gone out to market

355
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,439
explain how we want to update the

356
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:09,259
service and there's been a reasonable

357
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,329
amount of interest from regulators but I

358
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,069
think this increasingly this is going to

359
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:16,339
impact on everyone data using software

360
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,740
is becoming a much broader feature of

361
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,680
our life and

362
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
need to update and communicate with our

363
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,190
citizen consumers about those are those

364
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,380
data's and services will grow so again

365
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,800
to take the car example you know today

366
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,560
you buy a car the safety certification

367
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,060
is done when you buy the car the car

368
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,410
drives out the door there's no need to

369
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,690
update the safety certification policies

370
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,850
on the car but the car the futures we

371
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,640
described as was described earlier is

372
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,940
going to be a data using car the car the

373
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,279
future will have software the software

374
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,920
will gain in capability all of the time

375
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,440
and so the car whether it's the car

376
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,970
manufacture the software manufacturer

377
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,260
and in many cases it will be the car

378
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,560
manufacturer will have a requirement to

379
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,300
let the drivers of the car know how

380
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,790
those updates have occurred and so I

381
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,860
think far more sectors are going to be

382
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,690
moving into this regular update

383
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,750
requirement moving into a similar space

384
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,760
to the space occupied by classic

385
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,339
Internet service companies today and

386
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,810
again we can think of other aspects of

387
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,170
our lives like our transport taxi

388
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,350
services food delivery services you can

389
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,150
create a huge long list of services

390
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,570
which previously had no interaction with

391
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,640
personal data and increasingly in the

392
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,100
future will involve the use of that

393
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,620
personal data again in the consumer

394
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,300
interest but there will certainly be a

395
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,000
personal data that is being used those

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,029
services will change in terms of the

397
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,680
technology and the technology they can

398
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,300
offer their capability but they'll also

399
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,380
change in terms of their business

400
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,950
structures and there will be different

401
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,120
connections between different businesses

402
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,910
across all aspects of your life so this

403
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,760
notion that we need to update policies

404
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,290
we need to communicate with people about

405
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,579
what we're doing I think is going to

406
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,240
spread across the sector and again

407
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,970
rapidly earlier the new regulatory

408
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,320
frameworks that are coming down the

409
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,779
track I think we can anticipate in the

410
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,120
sense more attention and more regulation

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,950
in this space not just in the European

412
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,170
Union but across the world services are

413
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,790
going to have to constantly be

414
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,160
evaluating the levels of compliance of

415
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,079
their existing policies and updating in

416
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,959
reaction to either tweaks or full-scale

417
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,700
rewrites of regulation which are

418
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,010
happening I say from our observation on

419
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,390
an increasing

420
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,610
rapid basis across an increasingly broad

421
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,300
range of jurisdictions so I think we're

422
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,250
going to have to figure out what the

423
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,240
solutions are you know it gives us no

424
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,820
pleasure to sort of be stuck in this

425
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,420
repeat cycle where we are trying to make

426
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,980
sure that we're up to date trying to

427
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,730
make sure that we communicate

428
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,560
effectively with people who use our

429
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,020
services but finding ourselves locked

430
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,880
into cycles where we will spend months

431
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,850
and in some cases years arguing over the

432
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,250
legal documentation that accompanies or

433
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,820
underpins that service I mean we clearly

434
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,890
don't have the answers by our own track

435
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,560
record and so we're very keen to work

436
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,600
with a much broader community and my

437
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
colleague Stephen Devlin who many of you

438
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,000
may know who is one of our thought

439
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,300
leaders on privacy globally is working

440
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,970
on this trying to set up some programs

441
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,220
and some structures where we can talk to

442
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,230
a much broader range of people and try

443
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,770
to look at the challenge in terms of

444
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,090
some of the modern technology some of

445
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,350
the modern capability that's available

446
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,300
to us so that's looking at things like

447
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,730
user interface design to the extent to

448
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,040
which the user interface certainly for a

449
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,900
software service that can communicate

450
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,110
the core elements of data usage in a way

451
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,740
that is better than a formalistic legal

452
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,980
document again looking at presenting

453
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,990
bite-sized pieces of information so in

454
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,990
many cases there will be clauses in your

455
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,330
document that really are quite

456
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,400
meaningless unless until you use that

457
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,199
aspect of the service so again to come

458
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,459
back to something like location-based

459
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,609
services we can have three paragraphs

460
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,709
that describe how we will use location

461
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,530
data they will sit in the document but

462
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,449
in many case that's far less instructive

463
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,550
than the point at which within the

464
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,099
service you first access location being

465
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,530
provided human language information

466
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,359
about how that location data will be

467
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,730
used so trying to understand how you can

468
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,770
present information that will be there

469
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,720
in the formal documentation in ways that

470
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,790
are more immediately relevant to the

471
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,320
people using the service and that will

472
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,630
help them to understand it so again huge

473
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,340
amount of work there and certainly we

474
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,860
would not claim any exclusivity of

475
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,360
expertise and I hope that there will be

476
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,490
people

477
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,920
my advertising who are willing and

478
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,570
able to join in those conversations

479
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,760
because they Steven Dedmon is going to

480
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,830
be initiating on our behalf so I think

481
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,050
as as we sort of watched services like

482
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,620
asthma and again I I know there's wide

483
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,260
range of views about our motives about

484
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,770
the way in which we operate I would say

485
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,150
that you know from my experience inside

486
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,400
the company we genuinely are trying to

487
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,750
deliver services that are good for

488
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,110
consumers and we generally are trying to

489
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,000
do that in a way where we deploy the

490
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,620
latest technology we deploy the latest

491
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,800
features to them but we're transparent

492
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,300
about how we've updated our service and

493
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,910
deploy that but but within that

494
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,590
framework accepting that sort of basic

495
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,420
premise that what we're trying to do is

496
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,160
in the interests of the people who are

497
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,710
using the service I hope that others

498
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,440
will say want to join in a conversation

499
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,410
about how we can enable that how we can

500
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,510
make sure that we break a cycle whereby

501
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,750
companies are or I think it's less about

502
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,460
the companies it's more about the fact

503
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,230
that the huge amount of energies devoted

504
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,590
we devoted we think to the wrong part of

505
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,000
this equation the part that we should be

506
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,950
devoting the energy to is that clear

507
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,990
understanding between us and the people

508
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,300
who use our services about how they work

509
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,360
and about how the data is used thank you

510
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,309
for listening to me this morning I hope

511
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,559
that some food for thought and to say I

512
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,670
look forward to continuing the

513
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,140
conversation in the context of the work

514
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,730
that we're doing through Stephens

515
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,540
programs thank you
