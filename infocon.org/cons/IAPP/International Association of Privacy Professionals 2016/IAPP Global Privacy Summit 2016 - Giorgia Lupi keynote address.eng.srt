1
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,390
hi everyone Thank You Christine for the

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,300
introduction I'm Georgia it is such a

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,070
pleasure to be here and also a little

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,380
bit hard after Frank's fantastic talk

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,279
but let's see what I can do so today I'm

6
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,680
going to talk about data how original

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,850
right but I will not talk about

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,309
technology I'll definitely not talk

9
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:42,850
about Big Data I will talk about human

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,329
touch in datum handcrafted and even in

11
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,329
perfect data instead serendipity and

12
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,390
data and definitely about small data and

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,280
as a matter of fact I will also talk

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,270
about postcards data postcards but later

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,829
in my day job I work as a professional

16
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,800
in the data world I design charts data

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,660
visualization and interfaces that let

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,720
people access data in a visual way and i

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,390
run a design firm accurate and that i

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,820
co-founded five years ago we are a team

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,250
of designers data analyst and software

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,439
developers and we work across different

23
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,210
industries designing and developing

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,000
different kinds of data-driven digital

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,409
products for businesses and

26
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,380
communication purposes and in my

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,750
profession I realized that a common

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,000
approach very very common approach when

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,430
it comes to data is to throw technology

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,650
at the problem to begin with sometimes

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,540
without even spending enough time

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,970
framing the real issue and the real

33
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,310
challenge we have big data we should use

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,950
Hadoop or spark of whatever which are

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,460
only instrument and over the last year's

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,829
a lot of being done in research around

37
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,990
what technology can bring to data and

38
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,750
this is amazing but I believe that it is

39
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,030
the true convergence and hybridization

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,420
of science and design that can open new

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,149
perspective and take the conversation to

42
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,250
the next level because when we work with

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,320
information it is so easy to get

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,269
fascinated by the quantities the

45
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,549
variables the numbers it's so easy to

46
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,340
lose track of what numbers really mean

47
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,579
what it's important to display with my

48
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,260
company we work with business is an

49
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,140
organization of different nature and for

50
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,260
them we do build software

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,879
similarity black sport and we do

52
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,129
experiment and work with different kind

53
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,620
of technologies indeed but we also try

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
every time to look at any of their data

55
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,450
problem using a design approach from the

56
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,840
very early stage a design approach to

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,970
actually limit the possibilities to

58
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,610
increase the opportunities to focus on

59
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,290
framing the right questions and

60
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,540
ultimately to reconnect numbers to what

61
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,750
they stand for people behavior and today

62
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,159
I'm going to share with you two

63
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,439
completely different experiences where

64
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,379
self-imposed constraints in a way change

65
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,079
my relationship with data and change the

66
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,819
lenses that I used to look at the data

67
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,879
world the first one is called friends in

68
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,370
space last year a very peculiar

69
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,500
challenge was posed to my team by this

70
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,170
woman Samantha Christopher a tip she has

71
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,450
been the first Italian woman astronaut

72
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,950
and as you might have guessed already

73
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm Italian by the way so she contacted

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,989
us before being lunch on a six-month

75
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,659
long expedition to the International

76
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,150
Space Station and she asked us if we

77
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,459
wanted to collaborate on some real time

78
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,290
data visualization what she would be in

79
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,109
space our awesome I must say that there

80
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,480
will be to visualize like the orbits

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,459
around heard the speed and position of

82
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,549
the ISS also a hair twitter feed

83
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,250
visualized and map on a map on the real

84
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,799
time and I could really go on howrse to

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,989
list all of the data because the ISS

86
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,209
makes all this information available for

87
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,120
everyone the technology driven approach

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,160
would have taken us far from anything

89
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,319
meaningful this is exactly what we

90
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,849
didn't want to do and actually who need

91
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,540
this but still we're also compelled to

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,489
use all of the numbers that we have to

93
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,260
show the complexity and the power of our

94
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,599
engines and to display everything that

95
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,549
we analyze them processed altogether

96
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,239
more and more well but in the end what

97
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,760
we wanted to achieve was a way to make

98
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,659
feel her presence a way to remind people

99
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:23,699
back here on her that orbiting around

100
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,159
Earth up there there was a human being

101
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,610
trying to find way to talk to them so we

102
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,250
decided to frame just one question to

103
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,800
guide our design process is it possible

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
to use this data to promote very simple

105
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,969
and basic in

106
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,219
correction in human connection and the

107
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,709
idea was there already in fact the core

108
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,389
idea of friends in space which we like

109
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,610
to describe as the first social network

110
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,709
that extends beyond earth is very simple

111
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,949
you login with your social profile you

112
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,749
can see Samantha's real-time position

113
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,179
above your head within the trajectory of

114
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,889
her current orbit which is the yellow

115
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,679
arc as well as a map of all of the

116
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,569
people around the world that are online

117
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,539
in the platform in that moment you click

118
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,909
hello from where you are and a simple

119
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,919
arc on the map connects you to other

120
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,649
people who just said hello from all over

121
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,839
the world and every now and then you

122
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,909
also have the possibility to say hello

123
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,129
to samantha when you wear in Earth orbit

124
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,860
so when she was about to fly above you

125
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,319
so through this simple interaction you

126
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,360
connected with strangers you would have

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,909
met otherwise and the whole simple idea

128
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,709
is that you are part of a map of the

129
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,689
world that is linking different people

130
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,759
who are feeling the same emotion who are

131
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,829
virtually looking at the sky and at

132
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,739
Samantha together and where if you were

133
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,719
lucky you also saw and received a

134
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,669
feedback when Samantha was digitally

135
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,819
waving back from the ISS and all of this

136
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,679
connection has been recorded for you in

137
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,110
your control room in form of beautiful

138
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,360
images like visual souvenirs from space

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,259
and you see that data powers all of this

140
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,419
but in fact a very simple and human way

141
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,009
of connecting drives all of the

142
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,869
experience and we limited the

143
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:05,089
interaction by design because we wanted

144
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,369
to play with this simplicity of the just

145
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,009
sort of say hello waving and say hello

146
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,289
from where you are to other places on

147
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,079
earth and beyond Earth and through

148
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,879
friends in space tens of thousands of

149
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,860
people connected with Samantha and

150
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,599
between themselves and the whole

151
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,459
experience at the incredibly positive

152
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,949
response of its user taught me a very

153
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,179
important lesson that limitation with

154
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,269
data are the true way to transform the

155
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,639
abstract and the uncountable into

156
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,860
something that can be sealed felt and

157
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,699
reconnected to our lives the other

158
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,379
experience that I want to share with you

159
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,419
today is definitely more radical in this

160
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:45,750
sense and for me it

161
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,420
is the big data hangover relief it is a

162
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,000
zero technological your own personal

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,440
project a very laborious and

164
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,600
time-consuming one that took out

165
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,490
practically all of my evenings and

166
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,920
weekends for the last year it was a

167
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,810
collaboration with information designer

168
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,570
Stephanie Pacific so I am an Italian and

169
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,550
I live in New York Stephanie's American

170
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,560
is she lives in London and we only met a

171
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,320
few times in our life but last year we

172
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,030
decided to work together because we

173
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,430
discover that we have so many personal

174
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,920
and worse similarities we are the exact

175
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,740
same age both in our 30s both only

176
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,050
children struggling to have decided to

177
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,780
live far away from our family we both

178
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,630
work with data in a very handcrafted way

179
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,390
trying to add a human touch to the world

180
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,970
of computing and algorithm and most of

181
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,070
all we are both obsessed with drawing

182
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,040
with data with sketching data so we

183
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,710
decided to challenge ourself we would

184
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,960
get to know each other through our data

185
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,000
and through our drawings with theorem of

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,570
course so we conceived and started what

187
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,270
we call dear data and in common kind of

188
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,370
Correspondence of hand-drawn data

189
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,340
postcard so yes again postcards across

190
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,520
the ocean every week since September 42

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,190
cesium September first 2014 and for a

192
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,830
year we would collect our personal data

193
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,200
around the sheer topic from our

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,970
complaints the interaction with our

195
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,400
partners from the compliments we receive

196
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,620
to the sound of our surroundings from

197
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,169
our negative thoughts or our habits and

198
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,830
they show up for the week 52 pretexts in

199
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,650
form of data to reveal and investigate a

200
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,050
particular aspect of our self in about

201
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,169
our days at the end of the week would

202
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,360
then take the time to analyze our

203
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,849
information and to create a hand-drawn

204
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,299
data corresponding to each other and

205
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,370
fold the data postcard with us we will

206
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,349
send from New York to London into London

207
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,740
to New York eventually the postcards

208
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,180
arrives at the other person's address

209
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,100
with all of the scuff marks of its

210
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,190
journey or the ocean and we purposely

211
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,380
designed initial constraint or the

212
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,450
posters to form a consistent collection

213
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,430
but also to allows us to experiment more

214
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,279
with our weekly data

215
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,379
in fact the front of the poster contains

216
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,870
no tax at all is just hopefully a

217
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,550
beautiful drawing that you could take as

218
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,290
an illustration if you didn't know that

219
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,870
there are data behind and the back of

220
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,970
the postcard circle take contains the

221
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,499
address of the other person of course

222
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,569
the title of the weekend of the project

223
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:16,850
and the legend how to interpret our

224
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,850
drawings and we didn't send each other

225
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,160
any digital scan of our poster so we

226
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,680
both interior waiting to get the data

227
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,410
weekly portrayed of the other person in

228
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,389
the mailbox for a year also we're

229
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,309
discovering the pleasure of checking the

230
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,470
post book as you get home as Frank's

231
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,839
knows better of course it has been a

232
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,269
type of slow data small dare and

233
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,870
incredibly analog data transmission well

234
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,120
yeah in in during a time when everybody

235
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,160
talks about big data and virtual reality

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,389
we of course too small there than

237
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,759
physical postcards you know well it

238
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,309
doesn't sound very revolutionary but by

239
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,620
removing technology from the equation we

240
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,959
have been forced to extend our self as

241
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,959
designers on the one hand we have been

242
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,569
itch forced to invent 52 different

243
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,819
visual language is because hand drawing

244
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:06,949
data leads you to design that are

245
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:08,990
incredibly customized and tailored to

246
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,660
the data that you're working with but

247
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,879
removing computer from the equation also

248
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,889
triggered us to find different ways to

249
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,139
look at data as excuses to tell

250
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:21,019
something about ourself in fact as we

251
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,329
gathered our weekly data our process was

252
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,100
definitely more labor-intensive than

253
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,199
just arriving in standard metric from a

254
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,689
technological devices we conceived dear

255
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,579
data from the beginning as a personal

256
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,769
documentary more than a quantified self

257
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,139
project in fact we here didn't only

258
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,990
quantifying number we've been adding

259
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,550
anecdotal Xin qualitative details in

260
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,970
form of data to our data collection for

261
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,620
example the very first week of the air

262
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,420
data which is a pretty cold and

263
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,910
impersonal topic how many time do we

264
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,029
check the time in a week and so here is

265
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,920
the front of my posters and you can see

266
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,779
that every little symbol represents all

267
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,329
of the times that I check the time order

268
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,610
/ days and per hour chronologically

269
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,999
nothing really complicated here but you

270
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,370
also see that I added anecdotal videos

271
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,990
about those moments in fact the

272
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,000
different instances of my symbol

273
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
decayed why I was checking the time was

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,750
what was I doing was a board was I

275
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,850
hungry was I late did they check in on

276
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,560
purpose or just casually glanced at the

277
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,870
clock and this is the key part giving

278
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,420
Stephanie an idea of my days through the

279
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,520
protects of my data collection something

280
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,260
that is not possible if we don't

281
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,050
actually actually actively attract add

282
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,710
meaning to our tracking but we can find

283
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,990
data even in our minds and in the words

284
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,330
we use for example and not only in our

285
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,100
activities which is even more compelling

286
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,780
if the goal is telling you something

287
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,630
about yourself through your data at week

288
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,970
seven we tracked our complaints and I

289
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,920
compose this musical complaint cars

290
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,690
following a very literal visual

291
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,070
inspiration from the music notation

292
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,530
system to show the repetitiveness of my

293
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,600
complaints of different types over time

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,360
and their pitch their loudness through

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,190
the positioning of my complaint notes

296
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,350
over the line of each score did I truly

297
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,960
need to complain explaining in my legend

298
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,030
to Stephanie how to interpret my protest

299
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,310
and being very honest about how grumpy

300
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,730
have been in the true spirit of sharing

301
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,860
but we also figure that we can find data

302
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,020
even beyond the daily tracking and for

303
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,350
example make a survey or what we own

304
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,300
walk into our closets with the eyes of

305
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,760
the data collection looking for data in

306
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,589
the way we categorize and classify our

307
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,860
garments or we can try to use data to

308
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,990
become better human beings at least for

309
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,230
a week and perform acts to then be able

310
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,510
to report them like this week we

311
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,760
purposely smile to strangers and track

312
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,100
their reaction if they smile back or if

313
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,930
they pretended they didn't notice our

314
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,810
smile so I'm not going to show you all

315
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,780
of 100 104 post cards you can find them

316
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,760
online if you're interested and a book

317
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,170
is going to be published in the fall as

318
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,060
well but what I wanted to say is that

319
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,610
over a year Stephanie and I shared

320
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,980
everything about our self through it the

321
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,500
excuses of our data we truly became

322
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,420
friends through our data and more

323
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,420
importantly we both started to look at

324
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,190
data even in our professions through

325
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,470
different lenses so I'm not suggesting

326
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,330
you to start drawing your data or to

327
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,570
find a temple across the ocean or

328
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,680
actually if you want to do it now we

329
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,030
have an open section on our website

330
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,050
where you can find a date of payment

331
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,940
and it's already full of individuals and

332
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,529
teachers with their students who are

333
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,350
participating from all over the world

334
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,760
but anyway it is of course not

335
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,640
imaginable that we haul handle data in

336
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,000
our job but experimentations of this

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,430
kind we are we radically limit ourselves

338
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,130
where we drastically limit our tools in

339
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,320
our possibility can teach us a lot about

340
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,720
the perspective that we look at any kind

341
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,910
of data from because by shifting away

342
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,010
the produce from the technology you can

343
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,700
get closer to real meaning if you think

344
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,920
about it even when we work with big data

345
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,230
the whole point is making it more

346
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,630
meaningful more contextual it's all

347
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,120
about making it smaller smarter

348
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
understandable so for sure data is not

349
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,100
only a matter of Technology it's mostly

350
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,529
a matter of how we collect process and

351
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:12,810
relate with information it's the matter

352
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,940
how we design the way we look at data

353
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,100
and this is why I would say we should

354
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,160
try to shift from this data driven

355
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,380
design which is pretty common to hear

356
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,839
but somehow implies that numbers should

357
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,029
dictate how we approach the design

358
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,220
problem and that design should fit

359
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,959
within precise boundaries that are

360
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,870
defined by data to something that looks

361
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,020
more like this design driven data which

362
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,209
means we should design the ways we

363
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,240
approach handle used analyze and talk

364
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,029
about data keeping always in mind that

365
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,770
we have to translate how our numbers

366
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,190
into human terms and the real power of a

367
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,649
design approach is to give us the tools

368
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,870
and not necessarily the technological

369
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,480
tools and the format to recognize

370
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,250
numbers what they stand for because

371
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,649
ultimately is going to be as human that

372
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:04,980
will interact with data when we think

373
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,470
about data we always associate it with

374
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,110
more efficiency more automation in our

375
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,480
life and if I can leave you with one

376
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,790
thing today is that I argue we can

377
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,430
absolutely use data to become more human

378
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,350
to connect with ourselves and with

379
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,079
others a deeper level if we design the

380
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,329
right ways to do it thank you
