1
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,490
good morning it's a real pleasure for me

2
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,960
to be here to be with you in year 15 of

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,650
the ia pp it's amazing to me because

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,710
every year this conference brings

5
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,989
together more people to talk about

6
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,360
issues that are more prominent and

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,670
focused on work that is even more

8
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,150
important than the year before and every

9
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,000
time I pause and think that maybe we're

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,360
reaching some plateau or even peak we're

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,850
all proven wrong and the issues grow

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,750
more prominent and important still it

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,600
reminds me of the immortal words said by

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,479
this person who I will bet almost no one

15
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,079
in this room recognizes innate yes

16
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,509
Charles Dickens in 1859 he penned two of

17
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:16,000
the most memorable lines in the history

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,520
of literature when he said it was the

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,819
best of times it was the worst of times

20
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:26,319
and in some respects I believe he could

21
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,420
have been talking about the state of

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,590
privacy in our own time I think that

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,310
there are big opportunities ahead for

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,100
data and what we can do for the world

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,200
you saw some of that captured this

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,499
morning in Alec's book as we think about

27
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,479
the industries of the future the

28
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,549
companies of the future the activities

29
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,889
of the future there are going to be

30
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:52,990
exciting opportunities in the physical

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,850
world the biological world in the

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,119
digital world and interestingly

33
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,039
regardless of what part of the world it

34
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,579
involves it almost always is going to be

35
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,279
connected to the cloud I think it's

36
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:09,060
worth pausing and reflecting on the

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,310
opportunities this creates to change

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,920
almost everything in some kind of

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,890
beneficial way I see this in the work

40
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,330
that I get to do take one of humanity's

41
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,959
oldest in the

42
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,079
agriculture was invented 23,000 years

43
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,609
ago and for 23 millennia people have

44
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,189
been doing the same thing they have been

45
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:39,629
planting vegetables in the soil but

46
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,700
using cheap sensors and the Internet of

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,659
Things and data it is now possible to

48
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,579
grow vegetables this way and what is

49
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,799
most interesting is that in a world that

50
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,900
is addressing climate change in a world

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,000
where there are water shortages this

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,859
form of Agriculture can require up to

53
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:02,730
90% less water made possible in part by

54
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,329
the cloud or take another invention it

55
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,489
was thirteen thousand years ago when

56
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,280
humanity invented coins and currency and

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,799
it became possible to buy things and

58
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,959
save money and borrow and yet even in

59
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,819
our own day and age even this morning

60
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,519
there are two billion people on the

61
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,709
planet who still do not have access to

62
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,799
blent to banking using the power of the

63
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,319
cloud a company named Temenos is

64
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,659
basically realizing that wherever there

65
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,780
is a phone there is access to a bank in

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,120
just the last 18 months they have

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,280
brought baking to 10 million new people

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,680
and as we look to the next five years it

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,769
becomes possible to imagine closing the

70
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,979
remaining gap or think about a third and

71
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,459
final example an invention from 3,500

72
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,659
years ago writing and as soon as

73
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:57,329
humanity and they invented writing it

74
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,260
became important to read and yet even in

75
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,030
our own day and age there were people

76
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,729
who struggle with reading there are

77
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,889
people who have dyslexia and yet we see

78
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,459
a company in Sweden opt Alexia using

79
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,569
inexpensive eye tracking hardware

80
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,250
connected to machine learning and the

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,180
power of the cloud to make new advances

82
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,419
as you see here namasté North Korea so

83
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,599
like Papa said I am iterative if you

84
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,360
have undiagnosed dislike

85
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,280
today this is gonna affect your whole

86
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,860
life not only is your reading scale poor

87
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,189
but it also affects your confidence and

88
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,860
your motivation in school our issues

89
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,419
with every pupil should have the right

90
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,580
kind of support in school as early as

91
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,740
possible screening methods they do not

92
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,110
measure reading performance at all the

93
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,150
optelec see a screening tool is based on

94
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,490
actual reading so what we do is let us

95
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,740
generate the short passage of text and

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,050
we Nikora eye movements use an eye

97
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,270
tracker who have been using wishes to

98
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,729
give to develop the client for recording

99
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,979
our moments design movements recordings

100
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,289
are sent to the cloud and are processed

101
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,419
using machine learning models to look

102
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,300
for patterns that's different shapes

103
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,610
normal reader from an aesthetic reader

104
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,860
the customer needs trust us that this is

105
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,620
secure solution this is sensitive data

106
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,289
Microsoft has helped us to take our

107
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,020
method from being a research product to

108
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,879
something that we can actually do live

109
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,069
in school and here we have the

110
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,020
possibility to help children become

111
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,909
better readers and to improve their

112
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,509
lives I think in a nutshell that shows

113
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:41,000
how big data has the opportunity to

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,580
bring big advances and real improvements

115
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,250
for people and yet also why the

116
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,770
sensitivity of data will be more

117
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,620
important than ever and in a sense that

118
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,419
points to the other side of Dickens

119
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,330
phrase these are also challenging times

120
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,000
and one sees this in the events of our

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,610
day one sees us in the events of

122
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,699
particular days certainly one of the

123
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,860
more momentous days of the last two

124
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,060
years was on November to 24 2014 it was

125
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,279
a Monday morning and in Los Angeles

126
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,349
millions of people got up the way they

127
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,330
do every Monday and they drove to work

128
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,150
and some people drove to work by going

129
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,669
through these gates at Sony Pictures

130
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,400
Entertainment little suspecting that

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,319
they were about to become part of what

132
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,689
Fortune magazine would call the hack of

133
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,770
the century

134
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,349
and even as they got to work and found

135
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,479
that their computers their email their

136
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,210
documents were not accessible little

137
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,099
could they imagine that the events of

138
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,810
the ensuing weeks would take their

139
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,000
company across the Pacific to North

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,030
Korea

141
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,400
and the conclusion that they had been

142
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,670
the victims of a state-sponsored cyber

143
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,610
attack even then little could they

144
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,470
imagine that events would continue to

145
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,990
propel them forward across the Pacific

146
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,000
again to Washington DC

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,270
we're on December the 19th 2014

148
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,940
the very last thing President Obama did

149
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,730
before boarding Air Force One to go to

150
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,790
Hawaii for his annual vacation was give

151
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,660
a press conference and say this again

152
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,830
I'm sympathetic that Sony as a private

153
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,990
company was worried about liabilities

154
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,810
and this and then the other I wish they

155
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,450
had spoken to me first I would have told

156
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:34,440
them do not I'll get into a pattern in

157
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,530
which you're intimidated by these kinds

158
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,890
of criminal attacks that as much as

159
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,750
anything else reflects the degree to

160
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,600
which the world has changed because I

161
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,760
can guarantee that the engineers and

162
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,710
computer scientists of the country in

163
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,720
the world the people that you advise the

164
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,420
people at OTT that I advise never went

165
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,580
to a university course that had a class

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,150
called

167
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,460
what to do when your work becomes the

168
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,200
subject of a presidential press

169
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,950
conference and yet there's more somber

170
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,260
aspects of the world in which we live as

171
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,690
well we see this in other days like

172
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,600
November the 13th of last year it was a

173
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,870
Friday and in Paris people started their

174
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,820
Friday evening the way they often do

175
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,650
they were out in the streets they were

176
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,790
out at dinner in a cafe on the boulevard

177
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,160
Voltaire a man walked in at 9:30 in the

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,050
evening and he sat down at the counter

179
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,380
he calmly ordered his dinner at nine

180
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,580
minutes later he blew himself up within

181
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,400
seconds the streets of Paris were filled

182
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,679
with the sounds of sirens and the sights

183
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,260
of police cars and the next morning the

184
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,030
boulevard Voltaire and other streets

185
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,410
look like this with flowers warning the

186
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,900
victims of the night before and yet a

187
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
few weeks later on December the second

188
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,970
in San Bernardino California the sights

189
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,710
in this

190
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,840
were similar there were police cars in

191
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,420
the street by day and mourners that

192
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,990
evening commemorating the 14 people who

193
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,290
had lost their lives within days and

194
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,630
weeks and months we saw the connection

195
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,610
between those events and the issues that

196
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,800
we work on as people ask new questions

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,270
about surveillance about encryption

198
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,360
about the Apple case a case that proved

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,300
that everybody we meet anywhere we go is

200
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,120
likely to ask us what our opinion is and

201
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,750
then share with us their own we live in

202
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,730
a world where the pendulum can swing

203
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,540
back and forth and I think more than

204
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,990
anything all of these issues and events

205
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,570
and trans call on us to ask one

206
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,440
fundamental question what do we want to

207
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,770
stand for I won't presume that we should

208
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,780
all stand for the same thing or is that

209
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,940
or even that there is only one right

210
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,060
place to stand different companies have

211
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,770
different business models different

212
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,170
countries have different cultures but I

213
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,900
think all of these events call on all of

214
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,570
us to ask and answer for ourselves this

215
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,090
question I'll share with you this

216
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,720
morning

217
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,750
one person's views on where I think we

218
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,390
might consider standing and if nothing

219
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,860
else share with you what I think the

220
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,980
issues are that speak to us in our day I

221
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,730
think first we do need to stand for the

222
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,040
proposition that we will continue to

223
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,220
keep people safe that's why in the tech

224
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,350
sector companies across our industry

225
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,380
have come together to bring cases to rid

226
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,750
the internet a botnets to work with

227
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,400
state attorneys general and other

228
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,380
officials around the world to address

229
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,190
tech scams it's why we made clear a

230
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,110
couple of weeks ago that in the wake of

231
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,450
the Paris attacks we had received 14

232
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,360
lawful orders from the police in Paris

233
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,520
and Brussels asking us for information

234
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,790
we were able to comply we did so and we

235
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,310
did so with an average turnaround time

236
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,940
of under 30 minutes but if we're going

237
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,670
to keep people safe we also need to keep

238
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,230
in for

239
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,170
nation's secure that's why when the

240
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,630
question was posed we had Microsoft it

241
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,360
was important to stand with Apple I

242
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,760
think that's why the whole tech sector

243
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,970
United to stand with Apple and although

244
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,160
the case is over the debate is just

245
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,130
beginning and we are all going to find

246
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,260
ourselves involved in a discussion not

247
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,970
just in this country but around the

248
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,950
world probably between now and the end

249
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,950
of this decade working through the

250
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,590
questions that surround the use of

251
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,920
encryption these will be critical but

252
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,170
there's also other aspects and other

253
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,380
issues that are critical as well I think

254
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,660
we need to continue to stand up for

255
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,600
transparency that's why we at Microsoft

256
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,000
were one of several companies that suit

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,680
our own government the United States

258
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,940
government in 2013 arguing that we had a

259
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,990
constitutional right under the First

260
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,060
Amendment in the United States to share

261
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,340
more information with the public about

262
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,320
the national security orders that we

263
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,350
received as somebody who's been a lawyer

264
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,410
for 30 years the case that we brought to

265
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,790
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance

266
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,060
Court was like no other I had ever been

267
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,970
involved in most courts they have a

268
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,890
courthouse they have an address they

269
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,780
have a phone number you call the phone

270
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,700
number somebody answers in this case

271
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,980
it's all different you call the phone

272
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,700
number this is what you're here you have

273
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,260
reached the United States Foreign

274
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,210
Intelligence Surveillance Court please

275
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:43,480
leave a message the legal process was

276
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,880
different in other courts you file a

277
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,470
brief you wait for the other brief to

278
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,760
come back so you know what the other

279
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,530
side is arguing against you in this case

280
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,530
we got the brief back but when we open

281
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,560
the pages to read it we've never seen

282
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,220
anything like it

283
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,800
this is why we didn't stop with the

284
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,590
court across our industry we took our

285
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,420
issues to the White House and it's why

286
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,430
we were all gratified when President

287
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,190
Obama on January 17 2014

288
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,260
went to the Justice Department gave the

289
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,910
speech in which he's depicted here and

290
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,280
put our country on a path to

291
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,190
surveillance reform

292
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,199
and even though we're not finished yet

293
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,000
even though there is more work to be

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,649
done we are moving forward and I think

295
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,149
it's important to give credit where

296
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,310
credit is due

297
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,139
companies across our industry have taken

298
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,329
new steps Google was one of the first

299
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,759
and it led the way in showing many of

300
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,889
the rest of us how we could publish

301
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,980
better and more transparency reports the

302
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,889
e FF has been a prod to all of us and

303
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,509
even though there are days when I ask

304
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:51,029
myself why are we being prodded today in

305
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,160
this direction it's all part of an

306
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,620
incredibly healthy and important

307
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,790
dialogue it's part of what has led us to

308
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,649
take more advances as a company

309
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,319
ourselves to publish more transparency

310
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:09,060
reports we also need to look beyond

311
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,129
transparency we need to stand up for

312
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,709
enterprises for many of us the companies

313
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,100
for whom we work that's why we at

314
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,740
Microsoft thought it was important as

315
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,810
did other companies in our industry to

316
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,790
go forward and get certification under

317
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,889
the model clauses and provide more

318
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:28,949
benefits to enterprises in Europe it's

319
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:31,259
why we brought a case in federal court

320
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,560
in 2014

321
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,329
challenging a subpoena from the FBI that

322
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,610
sought the email content of an

323
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,569
enterprise client it was and remains our

324
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:44,370
view that when the government wants

325
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,160
content that belongs to an enterprise it

326
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,139
should go to the enterprise it shouldn't

327
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,209
go to the cloud service provider it

328
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,889
should give the legal departments of the

329
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,290
enterprise itself the opportunity to

330
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,300
look at the order decide whether they

331
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,089
want to comply or go to court if that's

332
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,420
the right course of action this issue is

333
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,759
not over there will be more in the

334
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,800
coming weeks and months and I think this

335
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,740
too will be one of the prominent privacy

336
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,290
and surveillance issues of this year and

337
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,309
our time we also need to look even

338
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,889
beyond enterprises and we need to think

339
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,290
about and stand up for people globally

340
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,980
as I come especially to Washington DC as

341
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,829
I go to meetings around town I find

342
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,050
myself constantly reminding people who

343
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,610
work here

344
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,940
one fundamental fact only

345
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,440
four-and-a-half percent of the world's

346
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,610
people live in the United States we have

347
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,520
a responsibility to the world and to the

348
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,980
people of the world and we need to think

349
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,730
about that responsibility every day I

350
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,260
think we need to think about what we're

351
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,300
hearing from the rest of the world and

352
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,250
even when we don't always agree with

353
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,170
everything it is just so important that

354
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,600
we understand where people are coming

355
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,270
from that's why I thought it was so

356
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,740
interesting and important after the

357
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,690
European Court struck down the safe

358
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,160
harbor to listen to the voice of one of

359
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,810
the more interesting individuals who has

360
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,810
spoken out max schrems and listen to him

361
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,050
say this that you're afraid these

362
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,620
companies are doing with your data we

363
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,940
have the basic problem that we have the

364
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,350
mass surveillance scandal and we didn't

365
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,000
really have any consequences in Europe

366
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
there were like angry letters by

367
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,910
politicians but nothing really happened

368
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,460
and the ado was ready to go after the

369
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,650
companies because we as Europe we don't

370
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,450
have any jurisdiction over what the US

371
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,950
is doing and the internet on mass

372
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,690
surveillance but they need these

373
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,910
companies to help them to get all this

374
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,980
data and the idea was to go after the

375
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,390
companies because for example Facebook

376
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,880
the one that was in this case is

377
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,090
operating 82 percent of their worldwide

378
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,980
user base out of Dublin which falls on

379
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,600
the European jurisdiction they can

380
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,910
actually say if you ate foreign spy

381
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,670
agencies that very likely conflicts with

382
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,260
European fundamental rights and that was

383
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,600
pretty much the case that was brought in

384
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,420
a fact as he made clear he couldn't sue

385
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,220
the United States government but he

386
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,130
could sell sue US companies and he

387
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,990
concluded that in some cases the US

388
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,730
government might be getting its data

389
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,040
from US companies in the first place in

390
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,920
a nutshell it shows the challenge we

391
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,500
have in rebuilding trust including

392
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,079
across the Atlantic that's why the

393
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,780
privacy shield is so important is why I

394
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,090
believe it's the right first step to

395
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,850
take is strengthening privacy across the

396
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,040
Atlantic while we also recognize that

397
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,590
there will be other steps that we will

398
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,320
need to take in the years that follow no

399
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,960
single legal instrument can address all

400
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,780
issues for all time but it is so

401
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,500
important

402
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,190
that we continue to move forward as we

403
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,350
do so we need to think not only about

404
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,390
what happens to European data in the

405
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,040
United States but we need to think more

406
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,080
about what happens to European data in

407
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,020
Europe itself as we've found in our

408
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,570
lawsuit that started on this island

409
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,640
Ireland in this building this data

410
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,180
center we concluded that we needed to

411
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,550
file a lawsuit as we have to challenge

412
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,620
our own government's assertion that it

413
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,660
can use unilateral search warrants to

414
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,540
reach any email content anywhere in the

415
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,400
world as long as it wants it it can get

416
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,710
a magistrate to say it can get it and it

417
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,960
has jurisdiction over the company that

418
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,230
has that data inside that in our view

419
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,160
goes simply too far and as we've moved

420
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,410
forward with this fight that I think may

421
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,480
well end up later this year or next

422
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,840
before the Supreme Court we benefited

423
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,730
from the broad support of many of you

424
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,760
inside this room from people from 28

425
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,430
technology and media companies 23

426
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,940
associations and in advocacy groups 35

427
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,860
of the leading computer scientists in

428
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,540
America and the government of Ireland

429
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,140
itself the day those briefs were filed

430
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,320
together was probably the only day in

431
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,470
the last five years when the ACLU and

432
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,460
Fox News were actually on the same side

433
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,590
that shows the breadth of support that

434
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,110
we have and it's interesting because

435
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,990
this too is an issue that is moving to

436
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,180
other places one saw the month ago on

437
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,700
Capitol Hill when the witness for the

438
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
DOJ appeared before the House Judiciary

439
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,280
Committee and he had the opportunity to

440
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,880
listen to this the country of Ireland

441
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,770
decides that in fact you committed a

442
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,590
crime and they want your self back there

443
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,490
should they be able to simply

444
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,820
unilaterally go to an Irish Court issue

445
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,950
a warrant and come get you something

446
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,510
United if the country violence a bit of

447
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,250
an extradition request for me no no not

448
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,780
an extra no no they want to come call

449
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,059
your ass in

450
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,850
I would oppose that sir okay so in the

451
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,639
tangible world that's an example where

452
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,320
we have absolutely no authority

453
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,710
whatsoever to take a person by the way

454
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,350
us are otherwise from another sovereign

455
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,639
country but let's just look at at the

456
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,860
intangible world the piece of paper

457
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,649
reduced to a PDF because that's really

458
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,940
what we're talking about we're talking

459
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,340
about something that could be tangible

460
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,929
fairly quickly but happens to be an

461
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:25,809
electronic format correct certainly okay

462
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,679
and you want us to assume that somehow

463
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,700
as two US corporations Microsoft Apple

464
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,519
whoever it happens to be that in my

465
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,590
opinion the bully is being bullied by

466
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,360
the Justice Department today in some

467
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,059
ways you want us to believe that you

468
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,590
should throw out all the history of

469
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,320
extradition all the history of you don't

470
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,509
get it you get to ask another country

471
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,970
for it and you want to have an absolute

472
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,460
right to demand it and get it if a US

473
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,080
Court says it and you have jurisdiction

474
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,559
over the entity who could control the

475
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,720
bringing of it back electronically to

476
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,149
you is that correct

477
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:05,499
unfortunately the DOJ the answer is yes

478
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,869
that is correct that's exactly what they

479
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:11,950
want and that does go too far but I

480
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,869
think we need not only to stand up and

481
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:15,549
object to that we need to offer new

482
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,200
solutions and here there is cause for

483
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,710
hope hope in a new bilateral agreement

484
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,360
that is being negotiated this year

485
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,309
between the United States and the United

486
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:26,830
Kingdom and I think there's hope and new

487
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,929
business models like the data trustee

488
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,610
model that we have created in Germany

489
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,070
where an American company Microsoft

490
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,379
doesn't actually access the data but a

491
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,590
German company t-systems does

492
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,659
interestingly we found that when we

493
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:43,450
announced that it was news not only in

494
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,519
Germany it was news not only in Europe

495
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,039
it was news around the world the next

496
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,629
morning when people got up into Asia

497
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:52,450
they turned on CNBC and they saw this

498
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,129
funny Microsoft through the tech

499
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:55,960
industry a curve ball overnight

500
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,149
announcing a German data plan to tackle

501
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,980
US Internet spying

502
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,869
let's bring in Akiko has been poring

503
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:03,340
over the details of

504
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,460
this one Akiko I gotta think that the

505
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,840
reason that they would set up data

506
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,400
centers in Germany

507
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm sure Germany likes the idea because

508
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,450
at one point America was hacking on

509
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,400
Ghaleb Merkel's phone and she was really

510
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,530
upset about that this is sort of a

511
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,170
reaction to Ed Snowden isn't it I mean

512
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,940
to keep it away from the pause of the

513
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,820
American NSA and those people yeah

514
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,590
absolutely Bernie you know American

515
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,240
companies have really struggled to

516
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,520
regain the trust of its customers abroad

517
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,010
in the wake of that disclosure from

518
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,650
Edward Snowden on NSA surveillance and

519
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,900
this agreement from Microsoft certainly

520
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,120
could have sweeping implications for the

521
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,720
tech industry it has once again injected

522
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,000
us into the mainstream of a great deal

523
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,100
of conversation it has sometimes

524
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,890
required that we step in to try to set

525
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,600
the record straight to explain what

526
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,310
we're trying to do what we're not trying

527
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,310
to do as I found myself trying to do the

528
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,120
day we announced that some very blunt by

529
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,510
doing this whatever sort of maybe the

530
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,120
philosophical view in the grander scheme

531
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,650
of things but it does deny the u.s. the

532
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,740
ability for surveillance of that data

533
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,850
well actually what this does is give

534
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,550
Europeans the confidence that if they

535
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,610
choose this option they their rights

536
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,790
will be protected by European law things

537
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,320
will have to go before a German

538
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,600
government or court and the United

539
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,820
States government can continue to work

540
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,970
in a lawful way by interacting with

541
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,980
other governments in this case the

542
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,200
German government but it will be done

543
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,660
pursuant to the international rule of

544
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,170
law that is what all of this is about

545
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,020
it's about ensuring that we live in a

546
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,120
world that is governed by law that we

547
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,830
have an Internet and that we have a

548
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,830
world where data is governed by law but

549
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,030
as we all recognize we need to modernize

550
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,720
the law we need good law and this is a

551
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,730
set of issues that I believe will likely

552
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,890
occupy everybody in this

553
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,680
room over the course of the next decade

554
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,010
as we engage in these debates as we work

555
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,740
to modernize the law we also need to

556
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,540
keep in mind one other thing I believe

557
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,840
we need to practice what we preach and

558
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,240
this is something that so many of you

559
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,670
are spending so much time advancing in

560
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,190
so many good ways it's what led we at

561
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,650
Microsoft yesterday to launch a new

562
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,110
privacy hub and unveil new privacy

563
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,960
principles to make clear not only what

564
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,820
we stand for but the way we're going to

565
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,680
stand for these principles and move our

566
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,740
technology forward in a way that enables

567
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,140
data to do what data should do to serve

568
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,300
people but also does so in a way that

569
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,610
enables people to do what they deserve

570
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,610
to do and that's know and control what

571
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,490
data we have and how it's being used as

572
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,640
we think about the future it is clear we

573
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,950
are all going to need to participate in

574
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,580
a broad conversation broader than the

575
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,620
conversations even that have taken place

576
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,390
in the first 15 years of this

577
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,480
organization we are going to need to

578
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,660
work together as we do that and as we do

579
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,920
so let's keep in mind three things first

580
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,450
privacy is an issue in fact it's not

581
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,120
only an issue it is one of the defining

582
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,620
issues of our time second as all of you

583
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,170
reflect privacy as a profession in fact

584
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,570
as you can see today it's one of the

585
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,720
most rapidly growing professions of our

586
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,960
time but more than this perhaps more

587
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,590
than anything

588
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,260
I believe that privacy is and should be

589
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,450
a third thing as well privacy is a cause

590
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:54,670
it is a cause worth embracing thank you

591
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,360
very much
