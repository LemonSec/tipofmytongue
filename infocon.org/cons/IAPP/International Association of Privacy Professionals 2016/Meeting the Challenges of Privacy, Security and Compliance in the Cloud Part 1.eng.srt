1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,690
okay well good afternoon everyone and

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,190
welcome to the IPP workshop on privacy

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,590
security and compliance in the cloud my

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,810
name is Brendan Lynch I am Microsoft's

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,699
chief privacy officer where I've been

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,039
for the last 12 years I Microsoft in the

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,529
IPP have had a long history we were one

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,009
of its first members 15 or so years ago

9
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,829
we were one of the founding funders of

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,260
the certification program for privacy

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,870
professionals and we've done many

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,180
partnerships with them along the way I

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,040
personally served on the board of

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,079
directors of the IEP P for five-year

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,590
term including being chairman in 2013 so

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,649
for me it's wonderful to be back here

17
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,820
wonderful to have a great group of

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,469
privacy and security professionals

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,160
together to talk about the cloud and

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,800
everything that we need to do to ensure

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,930
that we have the trust and confidence in

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,000
moving to the cloud and leveraging the

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,770
cloud for all the wonderful things we

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,430
can a quick rundown of the afternoon I'm

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,470
going to give some opening remarks and

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,630
take some questions from you so begin

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,159
start starting to think about what

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,049
questions you may have

29
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,030
we're then going to have Doug Miller

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,780
who's an industry expert go deeper into

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,580
the cloud and the promises and perils

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,040
will then hand over to my colleague at

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,170
Microsoft Greg Brown who's a standards

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,420
expert who will give us a good sense of

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,210
the important role that cloud stand your

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,159
standards play in the cloud both the

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,100
present and in the future before hearing

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,590
a really compelling case study from Gina

39
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,920
Holden at taser about how they leverage

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,590
the cloud for what you'll discover is

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,680
very sensitive information and then

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,560
we'll wrap up so with that I thought I'd

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,350
begin and make a few comments and before

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,790
we dive into the cloud which you'll be

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,100
spending the bulk of the afternoon on I

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,740
thought it provided a broader context to

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,049
begin with and and it's really just

48
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,060
about all the change we see in the world

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,050
today there are new ideas every day that

50
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,980
really are off

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,870
back of the new technologies that we're

52
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,200
dealing with this time and in this era

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,720
that we're in is what the World Economic

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Forum dubs as the fourth Industrial

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,810
Revolution and I'll explain what that

56
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,810
means in a moment I thought I'd first

57
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,190
back up and say what were the first

58
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,170
three well the first Industrial

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,500
Revolution began about 250 years ago and

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,950
it was where mechanized production

61
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,700
happened for the first time it was

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,150
leveraging water and steam power and if

63
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,860
you think about humanity up to that

64
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,590
point the fastest transportation for

65
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,560
example was the horse so when the steam

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,060
engine came along it was obviously very

67
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,079
revolutionary and it did it did have a

68
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,299
big impact on industrial production as

69
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,290
well the Second Industrial Revolution

70
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,870
really brought mass production and

71
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,010
assembly lines and it was heavily

72
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,599
influenced by the advent of electricity

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,840
and the broader adoption of that and

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,980
then the third Industrial Revolution

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,989
which we've been in for the last couple

76
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,329
of decades or a few more has been about

77
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,280
electronics and IT and its impact on

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,849
further automating production and so

79
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,829
that's where we are and where we've come

80
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,470
from and what what are the key

81
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,940
characteristics of this fourth

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,849
Industrial Revolution we're on we're in

83
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,630
and beginning to to be in in and it's

84
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,030
really the confluence of three broad

85
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,739
spheres of capabilities the physical the

86
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,959
biological and the digital and it's not

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,400
just advances in each of these

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,299
individually

89
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,889
it's how they interact with each other

90
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,900
about how the digital supports the

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,709
biological and so on the physical is is

92
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,889
everything from new materials through to

93
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,269
autonomous vehicles 3d printing robotics

94
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,180
and the like the biological is very much

95
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,339
about genetic testing and genetic

96
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,548
engineering and not just will have

97
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,140
impact on human health but also on

98
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,030
agriculture and livestock more broadly

99
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,650
and then the digital why

100
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,180
range of things but it includes advanced

101
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,060
data analytics quantum computing and the

102
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,150
like and so the the will economic forum

103
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,160
is is that it's the confluence of these

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,360
things and the pace that of innovation

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,610
that will come from the combinations of

106
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,979
these things and one of the interesting

107
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,500
things about it all the thing that

108
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,259
underpins all of these three is the

109
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,900
cloud the cloud is the new

110
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,479
infrastructure for our world and so

111
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,580
that's it's why it's such an important

112
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,380
topic I think for this workshop in this

113
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,169
day is recognizing the degrees have

114
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,850
changed that were that are undergoing

115
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,130
and the important and crucial and

116
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,330
fundamental role that the cloud plays

117
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,430
here are a few examples these are just

118
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,810
articles that you can't read from the

119
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,660
back I'm sure from the last month these

120
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,370
are just breakthroughs and in these

121
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,190
domains over the last month so the the

122
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,520
one on your far left is is autonomous

123
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,550
driving and a software company that has

124
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,130
has now rolled out the first fleet and

125
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,710
the first pilot of driverless taxis it's

126
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,250
in Singapore in the middle from

127
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,500
University of California Berkeley a

128
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,050
breakthrough which is a sensor the size

129
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,630
of a grain of sand which can be

130
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,330
implanted in your body and can detect

131
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,030
the electrical impulses for muscles and

132
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,349
nerves and and and it's it's sort of

133
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,870
powered by and read by ultrasound and so

134
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,870
you could imagine the real-time ability

135
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,479
to be able to monitor muscles nerve

136
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,870
activities organs which which will have

137
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,610
massive breakthroughs and it will

138
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,470
certainly replace these bands that we

139
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,630
have on our wrists if you're so brave is

140
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,570
to have these things implanted and then

141
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,870
on the far right is is the the creation

142
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,289
of the artificial atom using graphene

143
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,770
and and it's a promise in the the

144
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,080
quantum computing world is supposedly

145
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,150
going to be transformational so these

146
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,789
are just three small examples of recent

147
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,949
things that but they really just show I

148
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,229
think the the types of breakthroughs

149
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,760
that are happening with the confluence

150
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,159
of these technologies also the

151
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,390
underpinning of the cloud

152
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,880
as you might imagine at Microsoft we

153
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,980
have a lot of examples of these things

154
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,890
one of my favorites of how we're

155
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,530
bringing cloud power and data analytics

156
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,040
to help change the world is is this

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,350
example from Spain it's from the

158
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,160
Drummond Syndrome Foundation and it's

159
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,040
using the next generation the genetic

160
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,540
sequencing in the cloud to really

161
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,900
advance and and and speed up the time to

162
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,450
diagnosis of diseases so that patients

163
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,310
can get the right treatment early not

164
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,740
get the wrong treatments and and deal

165
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,410
with situations like that this one had

166
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,750
an interesting background it started by

167
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,030
a little boy in Spain called Scioscia

168
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,730
and his situation was that it's six

169
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,590
months old he was started having

170
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,820
seizures and many many many visits to

171
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,250
hospitals all sorts of testing testing

172
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,410
gene by gene to try and work out what

173
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,970
was the underlying disease causing this

174
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,040
and they they did discover and diagnosis

175
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,430
in about eight months time and believe

176
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,870
it or not eight months is actually quite

177
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,910
fast for these types of diseases there's

178
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,030
a lot of complexity sometimes you know

179
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,290
it can be a couple of years of

180
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,090
experimentation of different drugs and

181
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,190
all sorts of things to actually diagnose

182
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,710
what's going on so she has father

183
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,710
happens to be a Microsoft employee in

184
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,280
Spain and he he got together with a few

185
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,870
colleagues and worked started this

186
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,640
foundation and started to think about

187
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,220
how we might be able to leverage the

188
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,280
cloud and transform this type of

189
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,520
diagnosis in the future and that's it

190
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,710
essentially what happened you know

191
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,180
there's 40 terabytes of data they needed

192
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,160
to put in the amount of processing it

193
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,370
takes to work through these things used

194
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,080
to what used to take years can now be

195
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,570
done in a month and it's rapidly sped up

196
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,850
the diagnosis of not only drive it

197
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,620
syndrome but a range of other diseases

198
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,559
as well and has a lot of promise so

199
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,900
that's one example that's you know in

200
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,820
the healthcare space but there are many

201
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,620
many examples and I'm sure you've all

202
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,750
got your own in your own industries

203
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,420
about how technology is transform

204
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,470
and an enabling breakthrough advances

205
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,970
when I think more broadly about this and

206
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,579
and talk to my counterparts around the

207
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,019
world and various industries and

208
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,920
organizations one thing is in common in

209
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,430
all of this is that data is driving

210
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,160
innovation yes it's the computing power

211
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,810
and hyper scale cloud and all these

212
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,570
things help but a lot of innovation is

213
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,519
off the back of data and there's privacy

214
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,230
and security professionals that's

215
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,100
obviously very pertinent to our jobs

216
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,420
understanding the value side of this

217
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,430
help how important it is to advance

218
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,510
society's advanced individual

219
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,720
capabilities and at the same time as

220
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,519
managing the downside risks that come

221
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,190
with data but if you think about it it's

222
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,910
increasingly the digital world the

223
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,519
devices we have the interactions we have

224
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,139
that increasingly have a digital

225
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,500
component we are essentially as

226
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,329
individuals and organisations creating

227
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:55,339
vast and vast amounts of data which

228
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,949
provide all this promise but at the same

229
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:02,329
time they they there's some serious

230
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:03,740
considerations for security and privacy

231
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,649
and compliance it's all cloud-based

232
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,420
increasingly and we'll talk more about

233
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,360
that a lot today and it's all industries

234
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,620
one other example I use which resonated

235
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,360
well in my homeland of New Zealand where

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,130
I grew up both my parents were dairy

237
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,740
farmers but even the dairy industry is

238
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,920
getting transformed through technologies

239
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,810
so I'll give the short version of the

240
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,000
story here but it's it can imagine cows

241
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,240
walking around with pedometers on and

242
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,519
then a lot of data analysis happening in

243
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,319
the cloud in the back end and sending

244
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,959
information back to the farmer and the

245
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,630
ability to actually get early diagnosis

246
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,519
of disease because of the way that the

247
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,149
cows movements change very importantly

248
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,670
getting early indication of the

249
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,680
reproductive cycle about to begin so

250
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,329
that they can actually do the artificial

251
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,279
insemination at the perfect time and

252
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,069
really increase the the reproduction

253
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:00,740
which is crucial for not only milk but

254
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,380
you know growing the herds even to the

255
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,529
point where it's so scientific and look

256
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:07,180
at the data

257
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,910
they could decide determine the right

258
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,360
time to inseminate to increase the

259
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,670
probability of female which is obviously

260
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,890
what they want more in dairy farming as

261
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,610
well so that's an example of how one of

262
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,320
the most primitive industries that we've

263
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,380
had over time is also being transformed

264
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,510
by digital technologies and by the cloud

265
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,830
more broadly in thinking about things

266
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,990
specific to security and privacy I've

267
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,020
talked about the cloud adoption

268
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,400
organizations all over the world are

269
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,570
recognizing the the the transformational

270
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,850
strategic and economic benefits of

271
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,940
moving to the cloud and and so it's it's

272
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,730
happening at a very fast rate

273
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,190
we've also of course got the the advent

274
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,290
of machine learning and advanced

275
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,600
analytics again powered by the cloud as

276
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,230
a key trend in our space and it's

277
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,390
enabling things like more personalized

278
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,670
experiences you know I think that we

279
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,850
when we look at the world and we look at

280
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,350
all these vast opportunities that

281
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,420
technology is providing us it almost

282
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,000
seems like it's unconstrained but one

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,430
constraint that we have is human time

284
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,410
and attention and so we're all seeking

285
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,440
to be more productive without time to to

286
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,970
have our experiences more personalized

287
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,940
to basically make it more efficient to

288
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,550
get things done and we're we're just at

289
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,170
the beginning but we're seeing in the

290
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,660
individual space you know do digital

291
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,320
personal assistance and and I can expect

292
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,090
that we'll we'll see just a lot more of

293
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,540
that people are going to want to use it

294
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,250
they're going to opt into it there's a

295
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,690
lot of sensitive data that can be

296
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,280
collected through it so it's important

297
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,450
for us as privacy and security

298
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,580
professionals to really think through

299
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,620
how we do that in a way that builds

300
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,350
trust and mitigates risk and enables

301
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,350
compliance another big trend in the

302
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,910
space is there's with all this data

303
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,370
there's no surprise that regulators want

304
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,210
to have a say and we're seeing a wave

305
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,340
and I believe even more of greater

306
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,010
regulation around data one key example

307
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,380
right now which I'm sure will be topical

308
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,240
here at the IPP over the next few days

309
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,580
is the general data protection

310
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,200
regulation and Europe

311
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,960
it it it has more owners requirements

312
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,330
and more significant consequences of

313
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,090
getting it wrong I think that and other

314
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,640
things will lead us to a new era of

315
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,440
information management we're

316
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,780
increasingly going to be looking for our

317
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,240
information management systems to be

318
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,090
able to automatically understand and

319
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,420
enforce policies and rules around data

320
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,890
including not just who can have access

321
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,130
but how it can be used so I think that

322
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,590
those are a number of areas of

323
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,110
technology disruption but also areas

324
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,670
where we can use technology to our

325
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,730
advantage to help us in information

326
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,120
governance so switching to the cloud I

327
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,070
thought I'd provide a few perspectives

328
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,550
from from Microsoft as an example of

329
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,820
your major cloud provider in the space

330
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,280
one thing that's inherent in this quote

331
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,140
from our CEO Satya Nadella is that we

332
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,300
recognize that people in organizations

333
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,580
will not use technology that they do not

334
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,040
trust and so for us it's a business

335
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,640
imperative to build trust in confidence

336
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,010
in the cloud and to partner with our

337
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,710
customers in doing that so we make these

338
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,290
series of commitments we make a wide

339
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,040
range of investments to enable that

340
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,590
we're very focused on what are the

341
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,300
standards and practices and how can we

342
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,320
demonstrate those in ways that will give

343
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
you confidence give you the information

344
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,240
you need what what can we do to

345
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,530
collaborate with industry and with

346
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,870
regulators to help raise all the boats

347
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,540
to help build confidence in the and the

348
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,900
broader cloud ecosystem and and and

349
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,940
really as a company we're in your shoes

350
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,360
too we've got a lot of exposure to laws

351
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,860
and regulations around the world we

352
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,280
operate in many many countries and we've

353
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,050
got our own rigorous compliance needs

354
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,360
and we apply the same in the way that we

355
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,740
do it so that's sort of the the

356
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,310
commitment from the top down now what do

357
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,860
we do next how do we sort of unpack that

358
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,620
concept of trust what does it mean day

359
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,250
to day and investments to help and it's

360
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,590
across these four dimensions

361
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,950
security privacy control transparency

362
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,080
and compliance so the commitments of

363
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,000
course to implement the strongest

364
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,120
security procedures and controls and get

365
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,220
all the certifications to verify that we

366
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,550
have that that ensure that we're

367
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,370
safeguarding your data privacy and

368
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,080
control a bundle because it's

369
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,210
increasingly it's about how can we give

370
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,910
you control yes it's in its limiting use

371
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,100
and it's having conversations around

372
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,660
liabilities and all those sorts of

373
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,029
things but it's very much about how can

374
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,730
we empower you through our services to

375
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,980
have control over how the data is used

376
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,520
and who has access to it compliance I

377
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,839
mentioned before we we focused a lot on

378
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,839
achieving all the certifications that

379
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,310
there are customers demand honor of us

380
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,450
and in helping thereby you to be able to

381
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,310
comply with your needs and to be very

382
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,170
transparent Trust is always built on

383
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,120
transparency is that saying that

384
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,670
sunlight is the best disinfectant I

385
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,560
think it's especially true here and

386
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,190
there's so much that we and other cloud

387
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,339
providers have published to really live

388
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,210
up to that principle of being clear and

389
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,740
transparent and we're trying to do that

390
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,650
in is clear and plain language as

391
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,660
possible and tailor the content for

392
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,430
different audiences and I'll talk a

393
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,660
little bit more in a moment about what

394
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,220
we're doing specifically for the

395
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,650
security and privacy professionals so in

396
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,079
fact I'll start there right now you have

397
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,869
a vital role I you know I you all know I

398
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,359
bet that that you had you play a vital

399
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,390
role in your organization's around data

400
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,050
generally on one hand you want to be in

401
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,480
a position where you're helping your

402
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,449
organization enable the use of data to

403
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:29,300
drive that next wave of innovation to

404
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
delight your own customers and at the

405
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,220
same time you want to manage that risk

406
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,780
and you're responsible and accountable

407
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,510
for helping manage that risk for your

408
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,460
company so you're depended on and I

409
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,929
probably can't say enough about that you

410
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,670
know I know that in my own role when I

411
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,150
think of

412
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,730
supplier relationships and data crossing

413
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,650
trust boundaries to other organizations

414
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,290
that that we spend a lot of time and

415
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,250
focus on how do we ensure that we have

416
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,570
confidence throughout the data lifecycle

417
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,510
and all its movements that the rules are

418
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,230
being upheld around its use and and so

419
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,700
that is it probably goes without saying

420
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,080
that you have a crucial role the there

421
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,880
are a couple things that we do to help

422
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,480
you with that and first of all it's how

423
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,010
we actually approach our cloud services

424
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,400
and that's in in a number of areas I

425
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,590
talked about standards and regulations

426
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,020
we actually have a history of being

427
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,170
often the first in industry to achieve a

428
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,840
particular certification to it to a new

429
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,450
standard and we've seen that whether

430
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,340
it's the first to get European model

431
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,880
clauses whether it's the first to get

432
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
certified to ISO 27001 8 which is a

433
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,310
cloud privacy standard those are

434
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,230
examples of that and you can expect that

435
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,970
from us that we're always going to be on

436
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,160
the forefront always looking around the

437
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,720
corner listening to our customers

438
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,640
understanding what they want might want

439
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,730
next and going and going there we've got

440
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,160
thousands of people security and

441
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,560
compliance professionals around the

442
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,070
company working on this we do a lot of

443
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,050
work to actually stand up for the legal

444
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,150
rights of customers we've been in the

445
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,450
position recently of suing the US

446
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,820
government four times for various things

447
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,520
largely around the ability to provide

448
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,220
more transparency to be able to inform

449
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,440
our customers more about what sort of

450
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,390
law enforcement access is happening to

451
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,030
data or requests that are coming in is

452
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,050
an example of that so that's that's what

453
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,990
we're doing in our own actions and then

454
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,520
finally and then I'll open up for some

455
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,400
questions is we've created this new

456
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
portal particularly focused at the legal

457
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,430
and compliance professionals to help

458
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,340
them sift through all the large amounts

459
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,290
of data and have it tailored for them by

460
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,470
industry by region about how we can help

461
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,320
you with this the the website there is

462
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,440
Microsoft cloud assurance com

463
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,090
and you'll find a lot of those resources

464
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,070
there we're also partnering with

465
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,590
organizations to do training and we're

466
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,300
doing a number of customer roundtables

467
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,670
too to listen and understand your needs

468
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,250
this is an example I think of one of

469
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,510
those partnerships of where we're

470
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,520
reaching out to the community and

471
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,500
providing information and bringing a

472
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,830
broad set of perspectives together like

473
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,430
we have in this workshop today so those

474
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,900
are some of the things that we're doing

475
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,910
some of the broader context that I see

476
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,590
for the way the world's changing the

477
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,050
crucial role that the cloud plays the

478
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,270
crucial role that privacy and security

479
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,620
professionals and compliance

480
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,720
professionals play and some of the

481
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,610
things we're doing to help

482
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,740
so with that I'll I'll pause and I'll

483
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,470
open up and take any questions you may

484
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,840
have we've got a microphone up here so

485
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,020
when you're ready raise your hand and

486
00:20:50,020 --> 00:21:04,190
we'll take a question you talked about

487
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,950
genetics as the science that you're

488
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,510
primarily concerned with through their

489
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,320
other areas it wasn't per se that it's

490
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,180
an area I'm concerned with it was more

491
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,810
that it was an area where we expect a

492
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,330
lot of breakthrough and it's the the

493
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,310
whole genetics world because they can

494
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,310
now leverage the power of the cloud for

495
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,590
these advanced computations were over

496
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,170
large sets of data and derive new

497
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,400
insights that are really going to

498
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,790
advance human health and as well as as I

499
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,740
mentioned agriculture and livestock and

500
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,470
and the rest of it so on one hand you

501
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,790
know I'm saying I'm not I didn't raise

502
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,370
it necessarily as a concern but that

503
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,800
said you know our genetic information of

504
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,810
course is I've really some of the most

505
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,810
personal information that we have and so

506
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,580
we need to ensure that all of this is

507
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,950
happening like everything else that we

508
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,660
that we put in place the appropriate

509
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,700
security and privacy protections around

510
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,340
it so that we get all the good out of it

511
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:09,140
and mitigate the bad hi Jacob Jacob

512
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,960
Abbott Laboratories I'd be interested to

513
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,090
hear your thoughts of like the trend

514
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,710
towards the cloud no question but also

515
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,750
the trends from countries to localize

516
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,690
data and how I sort of like try to meet

517
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,200
those sometimes conflicts yeah I think

518
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,330
it's a it's a very interesting question

519
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,919
there are certainly is we all know

520
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,480
concerns often about where is the

521
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
location of the data in addition to

522
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,159
irrespective of where it is how is it

523
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,570
protected who has access and all the

524
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,990
rest of it and I think we're seeing a I

525
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,429
expect a settling out eventually I think

526
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,870
there are certainly some countries are

527
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,730
saying for at least for certain datasets

528
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,880
that we want to have that maintained you

529
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,649
know you know region or our country at

530
00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:01,100
the same time when you look at the pure

531
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,860
sort of economic and agility benefits

532
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,799
that come from the cloud they often

533
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,960
benefit from data movement and from data

534
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,390
video to be able to move around and and

535
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,980
be combined with other datasets unlike

536
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,590
and naturally that will mean often

537
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,279
crossing a national border so those

538
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,299
tensions are at play I I think that

539
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,190
there'll be as I say a settling out it's

540
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,710
probably going to be certainly us and

541
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,169
others looking to see what we can do

542
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:33,500
from a regionalization of our of our

543
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,140
cloud infrastructure we have at

544
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,419
Microsoft I think more regions than any

545
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,850
other right now I think it's 24 regions

546
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,309
or something like that around the world

547
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:46,250
where where organizations can can have

548
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,049
move to the cloud and have their data

549
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,299
stay within the region for example in

550
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,679
Europe you know because we've got data

551
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,270
centers in Dublin and Amsterdam and

552
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,419
building more out in other places you

553
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,399
can then enable that that kind of thing

554
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:00,919
so I think we'll see a combination you

555
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,690
know at the same time there's a big

556
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,360
public policy debate about should it

557
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,360
matter can we establish new norms and

558
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,669
treaties and the like that sort of makes

559
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:13,159
the makes the about the border

560
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,860
irrelevant in terms of being able to

561
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,020
uphold the people's rights so if your

562
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,990
rights get upheld no matter where the

563
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,419
data is based on your own laws locally

564
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:26,120
that's certainly a I think an intriguing

565
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,320
prospect and one

566
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,340
we're in our public policy discourse

567
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,540
exploring to see how that sort of thing

568
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,840
might work because that that should if

569
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,840
that could come about that would in in a

570
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,270
lot of ways I think take away there the

571
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,090
concerns and the need for for more

572
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,620
sovereign or localized clouds I see

573
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,170
Suzanne Ames Research Center this kind

574
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,390
of is a good follow-on to that question

575
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,670
how has regulation affected how Micra a

576
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,390
Microsoft approaches cloud services and

577
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:07,270
if it has what example yeah I think

578
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,590
that's a great question I think you know

579
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,010
one of the one of the things to begin

580
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,160
with is that when we first began in

581
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,890
cloud services and arguably largely

582
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,200
still today there's not cloud specific

583
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,450
regulations so it's all about how are

584
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,610
the existing laws and regulations apply

585
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,710
to this new paradigm and we see this

586
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,910
time and time again with a new

587
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,670
technology when when we first introduced

588
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,680
location-based services how do we apply

589
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,900
the existing law to this new thing

590
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,690
and the same was true for the cloud for

591
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,370
us that actually began 20 years ago

592
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,880
because that's when we had hotmail you

593
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,610
know and and and the consumer clouds of

594
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,610
offering for the first time we're from a

595
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,290
privacy standpoint even though the cloud

596
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,390
today is very different it's hyper scale

597
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,060
and it's got all of these you know all

598
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,680
these other capabilities that come with

599
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,460
it but the concept of putting sensitive

600
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,470
personal information on servers that are

601
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,170
none under your control you know in a

602
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,360
cloud environment and access it through

603
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,980
a web web form a web site was was back

604
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,690
then and so right at that moment I

605
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,550
wasn't at the company at that time but

606
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,830
it was all about how do we apply our

607
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,170
current rules and policies and

608
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,970
everything that you're designed to meet

609
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,250
the laws and regs around the world for

610
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,980
this new thing what are the controls we

611
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,050
should put in place whatever was the

612
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,850
what are the consent we should get what

613
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,170
are the informed choices that people

614
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,180
have how can we enable people to control

615
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,000
it to be able to delete their email you

616
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,380
know

617
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,050
that kind of thing and and and then that

618
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,880
sort of flows through so I think it's a

619
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,460
fairly generic answer but but generally

620
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,510
speaking the the it's it's about really

621
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,160
because a lot of these laws and regs are

622
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,900
principles based it's about applying

623
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,460
those principles to the new thing and

624
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,410
that's why you see our trusted cloud

625
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,320
principles being those cool things

626
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,630
transparency control security the

627
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,220
bedrocks of all privacy and data

628
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:13,330
protection law since it began you know

629
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,420
federal requirements for all IT if

630
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,350
you're going to work with the federal

631
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,900
government yes is a national institution

632
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,160
of standards in technology 800-53 is

633
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,570
kind of known throughout the federal

634
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,800
government and the federal government

635
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,260
really is only a small part of the yeah

636
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,530
total customer base that you have but it

637
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,430
has affected how how the government

638
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,010
approaches you know cloud services so I

639
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,610
was wondering how regulations affect how

640
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,120
NASA

641
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,190
I mean Microsoft approaches cloud

642
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,110
services yeah absolutely I know it you

643
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,670
know it's that's a good good follow up

644
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,620
because I I stopped short of going there

645
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,480
but but I was talking in the more

646
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,860
general case that's you apply the

647
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,660
principles but of course there are going

648
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,730
to be laws and regs and rules and things

649
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,890
that come out that are specific whether

650
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,170
it's specific to a vertical industry

651
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,540
sector specific to a certain country

652
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,730
where they do get more prescriptive and

653
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,270
and that is that is peak you know to to

654
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,530
the way that we provision out and

655
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,530
operate our cloud services we have and

656
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,940
when Greg comes up I'm sure he'll

657
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,770
explain more about the vast you know

658
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,480
amount of things that we have to deal

659
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,570
with like that but what the approach we

660
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,920
take is to establish what's that common

661
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,170
layer of controls that we need in place

662
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,270
to meet all these things sometimes a new

663
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,830
requirement will come in which means

664
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,450
we've got to add a new control often

665
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,930
it's it's a flavor of something else

666
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,490
that we've already got to control for we

667
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,930
might just need to demonstrate it in a

668
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,580
different way to meet that particular

669
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,340
rule or for that auditor and so but it

670
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,410
does it does these types of things like

671
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,990
nest and FedRAMP and all these other

672
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,520
ones they

673
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,310
we have a very significant impact on the

674
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,070
way that we design operate our cloud

675
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,600
services thank you

676
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,650
hi but Eccleston if I'm an interaction

677
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,810
I'm just going back on the data

678
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,940
sovereignty issue and specifically for

679
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,560
Europe you were quite innovative with

680
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,770
your data trustee model in Germany I was

681
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,380
wondering if you could expand a little

682
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,300
bit on this and and also outline whether

683
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,430
it's more tactical solutions until

684
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,310
things settle down or is this more of a

685
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,000
strategic or more of a strategy for

686
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,850
Europe where you won't deploy sort of

687
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,680
specific agreements with the Turkish tea

688
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,230
providers in order to build that trust

689
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,660
and give control to their customer yeah

690
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,210
it's a great question and I'll might

691
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,040
just take a minute to explain for those

692
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,360
in the audience who might not know what

693
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,360
what the the model that we're that were

694
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,360
adopting and in Germany as a first

695
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,490
instance and it's it's called a data

696
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,650
trustee model so it's a it's a data

697
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,480
center very similar to the ones that we

698
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,090
design and build everywhere in the world

699
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,470
except that Microsoft's not operating it

700
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,650
it's operated by in this case a

701
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,950
subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom so it's

702
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,140
German nationals

703
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,940
it's a Germany based its German

704
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,990
nationals operating it and and and the

705
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,880
reason behind it I think is partially to

706
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,540
is looking at that there is a need and

707
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,380
expectation for some customers

708
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,150
particularly for some workloads or some

709
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,100
data sets that they really do want to

710
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,010
keep its sovereign health health data is

711
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,100
often in that realm but it's part of the

712
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,310
broader approach that we have which is

713
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,110
we want to cater to everybody's needs

714
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,230
and we have hybrid we have everything

715
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,450
from the public cloud through to the

716
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,970
on-premise solution and then variations

717
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,040
in between and this is just somewhere on

718
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,550
that spectrum where it's it's about you

719
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,160
know sort of enabling a certain set now

720
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,690
there is one thing that's important to

721
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,250
understand there is it's a more

722
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,470
expensive model it was the price premium

723
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,020
to that but they may well be demand you

724
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,910
know demand that

725
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,160
will because you back to the benefits of

726
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,450
the cloud and the strategic and economic

727
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,420
benefits if there's a data set or a

728
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,340
workload that's just too sensitive to

729
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,890
put in the public cloud for example this

730
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,900
may well be a really viable option and

731
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,450
for our customers and so that's we made

732
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,880
that announcement a while back in

733
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:29,890
building towards that one yes and can

734
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,210
you elaborate a little bit on the

735
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,710
scenarios you had talked about the legal

736
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:40,030
challenges here in the US now what the

737
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,870
there was actually been for legal

738
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,240
challenges to the US government

739
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,270
three of which are pretty much concluded

740
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,170
and one that's ongoing the the first was

741
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,330
in the wake of the Snowden revelations

742
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,750
and us you know we'd already been

743
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,340
publishing a transparency report on the

744
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,160
the law enforcement requests that we get

745
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,940
for data and and the like but we were

746
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,500
prohibited in the national security

747
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,290
sense to be able to do that about FISA

748
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,320
Court requests and like so we were we

749
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,880
with the RET with others in industry

750
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,180
challenged the US government to allow us

751
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,540
to be more transparent around that and

752
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,430
eventually the the Justice Department

753
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,950
agreed and gave some parameters for that

754
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,170
you know we can report and blocks of

755
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,110
like it's between zero and nine hundred

756
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,000
and you know nine hundred and two

757
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,250
thousand or whatever it is but but there

758
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,830
was a successful case there was there

759
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,680
was another one where we were asked for

760
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,420
data relating to an enterprise customer

761
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,080
and our policy is to redirect law

762
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,270
enforcement to the enterprise customer

763
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,890
because we don't know how to finish the

764
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,160
request it's we're just the you know the

765
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,440
story of the data it's them that it

766
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,170
should go to and and we were successful

767
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,270
and

768
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,610
in that case as well then there was a

769
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,340
third one which was cross international

770
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,890
one which we call the warrant case but

771
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,320
it was a warrant in New York which was

772
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,590
seeking to get a data from the Microsoft

773
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,030
cloud relating to a customer whose data

774
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,750
was in Europe a non-us citizen whose

775
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,540
data was in Europe and what we were

776
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,350
really standing up there for was the to

777
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,150
stand up for the principle that the same

778
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,190
protections that you have a place in the

779
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,800
analogue word willed should apply in the

780
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,440
digital world so for example why should

781
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,740
the printed copy of this email in this

782
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,580
individuals house in a foreign country

783
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,940
have more protection than the copy on

784
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,120
the server and and the argument was from

785
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,290
the US government side where there's

786
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,059
these were business records and we had

787
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,440
the ability to hand them over therefore

788
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,500
we should and again we've revealed

789
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,710
prevailed in that case that went to it

790
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,550
went to an appeal and then most recently

791
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,530
we have a case which is again it's a

792
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,560
transparency thing but it's also about

793
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,440
it's about being a right and ability to

794
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,859
be able to inform customers of when

795
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,600
there is a regal request for their data

796
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,449
now often there are situations where

797
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,889
there was a gag order on that because

798
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,168
revealing it to him you know would tip

799
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,109
them off that you know they're the

800
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:37,679
crimes are about to be busted but what

801
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,399
we noticed over time was that the the

802
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,619
gag orders on these were increasingly

803
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,340
frequent and and were unbound from a

804
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,850
timing perspective and so that's what

805
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,290
this lawsuit is about and we've recently

806
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,510
just got a lot of support and amicus

807
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,918
briefs from another and others in

808
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,720
industry and civil society and etc to to

809
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,540
really try to curtail that and not have

810
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,670
there are places where that makes sense

811
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,730
and as a society we want that but it

812
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,680
really felt like the the government was

813
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,220
overusing this ability to put a gag

814
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,250
order in place

815
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,980
and not set a time limit on it so that's

816
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,599
the one that's more current and active

817
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,140
right now

818
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,769
okay well I will wrap up with one final

819
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,059
question for Brendon I think we have

820
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:35,009
about another few minutes in our in our

821
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,470
time slide here so Brendon your chief

822
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,210
privacy officer one of the largest tech

823
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,680
technology companies in the world that

824
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,319
puts really real on the front line and

825
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:45,029
we know all these things are coming down

826
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:46,829
the pike for example in Europe you've

827
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:47,880
got the general data protection

828
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,619
regulation which you mentioned we've got

829
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,079
privacy shield which max schrems has

830
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,920
assured us will be challenged in court

831
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,089
what are you going to spend the next 12

832
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:58,499
months sort of what's going to be

833
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:02,130
keeping you awake in this coming year

834
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,940
I think the you know in some ways I know

835
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,019
a lot of my counterparts around industry

836
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,979
are going to be spending a lot of time

837
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:14,670
on how do I reorient my program to meet

838
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,789
these new European rules and and that's

839
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:19,319
that's true of us as well there are

840
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,519
certain things that we've got to do

841
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,229
we've I think fortunate that there's

842
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:24,479
been a lot of investment in privacy at

843
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,400
Microsoft over the years I'm actually

844
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,319
the third chief privacy officer say I

845
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,450
was lucky enough to inherit an already

846
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,450
mature program when I joined and so it's

847
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,509
continual improvement so you know we've

848
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:38,339
got time there's some of these timelines

849
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,630
are short particularly if you've got to

850
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,749
make system changes and things like that

851
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:44,400
may 28th een will come around pretty

852
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,469
quickly so that certainly got a lot of

853
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,719
my attention to make sure that we we do

854
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,150
all what we need to do not only to

855
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,549
achieve our own compliance but back to

856
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:55,619
the our cloud in our enterprise

857
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,930
customers what do we need to do and what

858
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,180
can we do to help our enterprise

859
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,279
customers so that'll be a lot of focus I

860
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,069
think the the other broad theme for me

861
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:07,170
is just the pace of change back to where

862
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,700
I began this talk and when you think

863
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,979
about things like doing a privacy review

864
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,259
to make sure that a new data collection

865
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:19,440
or a new data use is in with lying with

866
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,999
our values and our policies and our

867
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:24,930
principles you know the the ability to

868
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,680
kind of take some time to do that review

869
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,259
is disappearing quickly and what it

870
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,599
leads to I think is a shift in the

871
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,910
approach a little bit more emphasis on

872
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,089
how do we create broader awareness how

873
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,260
do we

874
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,359
create more more of the cultural element

875
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,250
so people just know what the rules are

876
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,109
when they're doing this targeting

877
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:47,339
particular communities we've got a lot

878
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,559
of data scientists at Microsoft how do

879
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,770
we how can we inform them in a way to go

880
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,970
and do all the cool work they're doing

881
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,490
but also to be cognizant of where they

882
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,799
might run afoul of our privacy policy so

883
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,230
it happens more organically and by

884
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,890
design

885
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,690
so I think those are a few of the focus

886
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,260
areas for me
