1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,649
well good morning everybody and thank

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,710
you very much boy Jana for those very

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,570
very generous words it's a bit like

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,940
hearing your own funeral oration but I

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,090
do i do assure you and you know I'm not

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,000
gone yet Hera Wilson famously said that

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
a week is a long time in politics well

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,470
I've got ten weeks to go and ten weeks

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,649
in digital is a long time to the power

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,500
of of 10 and there's a lot of politics

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,559
going on in case you you hadn't noticed

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:41,640
so it's a great pleasure to be with you

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,989
this morning and to see a lot of old

14
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,980
friends and possibly just reflect a

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,489
little bit on what we can learn from

16
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,829
from seven years that's relevant to

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:07,650
what's going on now um I think the first

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,549
point I would make is that it's a it's a

19
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,140
miracle that i'm still here you see 70

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,030
years seven years as it's a traditional

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,920
time for it for apprenticeships i'm just

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,049
about ready to start now but seven years

23
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,460
it's been a time when there's been so

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,009
much change in the digital space and so

25
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,409
much time so much change in the economy

26
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,540
as a whole i think one thing i have to

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,390
be very thankful for is that that i'm in

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,390
a job and that you're in a job because

29
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,270
lots of people aren't and one of the

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,939
reasons that i'm in a job is that the

31
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,380
information commissioner in the UK is

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,270
this peculiar animal a corporation soul

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,149
appointed by Her Majesty the Queen and I

34
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,799
think we ought on this on this

35
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,049
auspicious day the occasion of her 90th

36
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,119
birthday to wish her majesty many happy

37
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,240
returns of the day because in my warrant

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
appointing me as the information

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,799
commissioner she describes me as trusty

40
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,690
and well-beloved so I think I should

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,400
return the

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,079
the compliment but term it's um it's

43
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,500
it's a point i like to make that the

44
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,329
Independence of the Data Protection

45
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,150
Authority in the UK is established

46
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,040
because the Information Commissioner

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,359
once appointed can only be removed by

48
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,159
joint resolution of both houses of

49
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,989
parliament and dismissed by Her Majesty

50
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,459
the Queen so it gets kind of good job to

51
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,230
have in a recession and looking back

52
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,290
over seven years what what a recession

53
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,500
it's been you are in an area that's been

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,209
growing but a lot of a lot of other

55
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,790
areas haven't and it's as well to

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,370
remember that and the ICO over seven

57
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,280
years I think reflects the growth in the

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
importance of the digital business

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,019
because the extra responsibilities that

60
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,209
we've been given by Parliament mean that

61
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,760
if you compare the head count now with a

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,030
head count when I when I came in the

63
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,120
growth has been spectacular so much more

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,269
to do we've had to do as they say better

65
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,190
for less we've had to find new ways of

66
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,560
doing things but if you look at

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,659
full-time equivalents in 2009 we just we

68
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,419
had just over 300 staff and it's now

69
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,940
just over 400 it's been a thirty five

70
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,599
percent increase in the full time

71
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,329
equivalent of people working at the ICO

72
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,290
and that's supported not by government

73
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,169
money not by granting aid because that

74
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,699
for the Freedom of Information side of

75
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,650
the business has been consistently cut

76
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,500
year after year after year it's been the

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,019
growth in notifications under the data

78
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,659
protection act the growth in in people

79
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:58,120
signing up as as data controllers and

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,519
that's provided the resources for the

81
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,379
Data Protection Authority here in the UK

82
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,479
to do the job that boy Jana has been

83
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,209
describing and as Trevor said it's a

84
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,790
good time to be a privacy profession or

85
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,069
two isn't it because we've heard that

86
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,440
the data protection regulation will

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,769
require the recruitment of 28,000 data

88
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,300
protection officers

89
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,550
um and the the the game that we're all

90
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,630
in is making sure that we can get the

91
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,780
benefits that digital offers while

92
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:44,070
avoiding the risks now the benefits that

93
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,570
digital offers if you think back over

94
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,479
seven years part of my standard stump

95
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,550
speech will be will be hearing from

96
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,970
lauren from Transport for London shortly

97
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,590
but part of my standard stump speech

98
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,500
when I started was isn't it exciting all

99
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,169
the wonderful things that can be done by

100
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,330
mashing digital information looking at

101
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,820
maps of transport maps of London looking

102
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,010
at accident statistics and planning safe

103
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,190
cycle routes and this was before we ever

104
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,700
got to silicon roundabout and all that

105
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,229
sort of thing but clever people in bike

106
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,030
sheds in Hackney were developing apps

107
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,389
that would make for safe safe cycling in

108
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,900
London and all of us are in the business

109
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,110
of making sure that digital delivers the

110
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,510
good things and that we avoid the

111
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,440
pitfalls that we we find the

112
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,229
opportunities and and that and the

113
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,760
growth and the prosperity that comes

114
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,550
from that but but we avoid the threats

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,710
it's been said I don't know who said it

116
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,080
I'd be in shamelessly repeating it that

117
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,330
we thought that digital was the new oil

118
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,950
and then we discovered that it was also

119
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,930
the new asbestos so it's about managing

120
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,610
the the threats as well as the

121
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,990
opportunities and that's the business

122
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,599
that you're in when i was attending the

123
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,020
recent I APPL summit in Washington on

124
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,789
the subway there was an an an ad for a

125
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,190
digital security service wasn't a very

126
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,320
good ad because I don't remember who it

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,150
was advertising but I do remember the

128
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,500
line which was digital is rockstar but

129
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,020
it needs a good manager or it trashes

130
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,260
everything and it's the balance of the

131
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,020
opportunities and the threats that the

132
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,729
that is the business that we are all in

133
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,160
but at the global privacy summit

134
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,259
listening to some of the speeches I

135
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,330
wondered whether we actually are in

136
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,669
quite the same business because the

137
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,849
danger is that some people are inclined

138
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,229
to use the the term privacy when they

139
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,530
actually just mean digital some of the

140
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,169
speeches that I heard you could just

141
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,870
take out the word privacy and put in the

142
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,090
word digital and it was exactly the same

143
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,409
message in other words it was all about

144
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:11,080
the opportunities and and none about

145
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,659
threats now it's the Data Protection

146
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,120
Authority for the UK the Information

147
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,060
Commissioner's Office is very much about

148
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,659
advice and guidance and enforcement to

149
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,080
make sure that the threats the personal

150
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,569
privacy are properly managed and if we

151
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,219
get too excited about all the wonderful

152
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,580
opportunities and don't manage our way

153
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,560
through the regulation then we're not

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,009
doing anyone any favors and I I I heard

155
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,050
a little bit too much buccaneering

156
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,690
speech from the people charging off to

157
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,270
the great new world not bearing in mind

158
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,110
sufficiently the way in which you can do

159
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,449
that but you can do that safely and if

160
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,279
you don't do that safely then you're

161
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,270
going to be in trouble with the

162
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,060
authorities it's no good saying what we

163
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,009
don't it's a brave new world we don't

164
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,750
need all this regulation it's just

165
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,029
getting in the way the clever thing to

166
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,550
do is to work out where you want to go

167
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,650
and how you're going to get there but

168
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,430
making sure that you don't disrespect

169
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,630
individuals autonomy and the rights of

170
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,880
citizens and consumers and the

171
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,889
information commissioner's office under

172
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,960
whoever's leadership is going to be

173
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,740
constantly making the point to you this

174
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,259
is how you get the best of both worlds

175
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,449
this is how you get the opportunities

176
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,779
and the growth in the excitement of

177
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,120
doing things a new and exciting way but

178
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,159
you do it without disrespecting and

179
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,078
people's privacy and I found myself

180
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,940
playing a little game because I like

181
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,279
anagrams and I discovered that the

182
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,940
whether you call it privacy or privacy

183
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,530
there's only one letter difference

184
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,590
between privacy and piracy and be

185
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,750
ambitious do what you want do what you

186
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,400
want to do but stick within the rules

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,380
and the Information Commissioner's

188
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,350
Office will be your ally but get it get

189
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,710
it wrong and you're going to be in

190
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,530
trouble with the regulator who ever

191
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,000
whoever it is now if you were attending

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,730
the session on the the jurisprudence

193
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,440
around the general data protection

194
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,180
regulation yesterday you'll have heard

195
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,790
my my colleague steve wood talking about

196
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,340
some of the things that the the ICO is

197
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,990
doing to make sure that the regulation

198
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,090
when it comes in finally in two years

199
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,910
time is something that can be complied

200
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,210
with relatively easily I'm sure he will

201
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,260
have referred you to the ICO website WWI

202
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,210
co uk where you can access our 12 steps

203
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,250
to take now to compliance with the the

204
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,470
new regulation yesterday we were holding

205
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,640
an event for small business in in

206
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,710
Birmingham and we were bigging up our

207
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,290
SME toolkit which you can also find on

208
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,550
on the website we've been conducting

209
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,110
stakeholder consultations and we're

210
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,840
standing ready for advice and guidance

211
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,880
and I had a call yesterday for one of my

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,840
opposite number data protection

213
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,340
authorities in Europe saying it can you

214
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,110
send us all your stuff because we need

215
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,700
to do that too and we don't we don't

216
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,800
want to reinvent the wheel so working

217
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,360
with our colleagues in the article 29

218
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,520
working party we're going to make sure

219
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,120
that we are effective partners and in

220
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,870
implementing the data protection

221
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,210
regulation Brianna said some heroic

222
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,760
things about fines I don't know whether

223
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,790
Spain finds more than the UK or UK finds

224
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,980
more than Spain what I do know is Spain

225
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,020
gets to keep the money in and and I have

226
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,810
to hand it over to to George Osborne but

227
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,260
the the fines that we do impose our are

228
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,360
pretty small beer I mean it's it's not

229
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,499
it's not good ahead

230
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,499
is it if you're hit with them 350

231
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,929
thousand pound fine for doing stupid

232
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:10,599
things with the nuisance phone calls but

233
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,639
I'm sure you will have heard and it's

234
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,219
it's a it's a point that I think you

235
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:18,429
need to take back and stress to your

236
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,709
chairman and the board and your chief

237
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,169
executive and your chief finance officer

238
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,689
it's not about half a million pounds

239
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,339
from the information commissioner

240
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,289
anymore it focus on 20 million euros up

241
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:36,999
to 20 million euros focus on up to four

242
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:40,499
percent of global global turnover I

243
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,089
think those are figures that should

244
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:44,709
interest the chairman on the board and

245
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,239
the chief executive in the chief finance

246
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,159
office of course they sure as hell will

247
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,029
interests shareholders now I'm not

248
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:53,529
suggesting that we're suddenly going to

249
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,329
go into a very butch world of finding

250
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,569
finding everybody but this regulation

251
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:00,519
the European general data protection

252
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,399
regulation means business when it comes

253
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,039
to enforcement so that's the big stick

254
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,049
in the cupboard yes we want to work with

255
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,359
you yes we want to give clear advice and

256
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,939
guidance yes we want to enable good

257
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,429
things to happen and show you ways of

258
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,589
achieving what you want to achieve while

259
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,689
sticking to the rules but in the

260
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,720
background for those organizations that

261
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,309
don't take any notice for those

262
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:27,039
organizations that don't care for those

263
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,779
organizations that think they can get

264
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,849
away with it it's not a question of

265
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,249
shrugging off up to half a million

266
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:37,359
pounds if you're some great global

267
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,909
company that can well afford it this is

268
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:44,739
serious money and serious enforcement

269
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:47,529
which which you would do well to plan

270
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,389
for very carefully if you look at those

271
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,349
12 steps a lot of it is about raising

272
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,679
awareness within the organization of the

273
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,919
role which people like you need to play

274
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,529
it's not it's no longer something that

275
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,879
happens down the end of the of a

276
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,319
corridor we don't care very much about

277
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,469
it this is absolutely slap bang on the

278
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,709
risk register of any organization

279
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,299
commercial or otherwise and needs to

280
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,310
needs to be taken on board

281
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,639
now Vienna said we dealt with we've

282
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,600
dealt with the previous of shield and

283
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,829
now we can move on and think about the

284
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,589
regulation well I wish we had dealt with

285
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,810
the the privacy shield because I saw a

286
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,839
story running on Reuters yesterday but

287
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,610
some high-up figure in the American

288
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,889
administration was saying 'yeah will

289
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,540
read very carefully what the article 29

290
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,000
working party had to say about the

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,639
regulation but basically we're not very

292
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,649
interested in in say much more about

293
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,190
this and I paraphrase the article 29

294
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,839
working party of the data protocol the

295
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,639
dead protection authorities was

296
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,540
reviewing the documentation that emerged

297
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,480
from the European Union and American

298
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,279
negotiations on the privacy shield and

299
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,009
we asked some very simple and basic

300
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,410
questions which are about clarification

301
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,170
and if the data protection authorities

302
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,870
who are fairly expert in this area are

303
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,000
asking questions and you can be pretty

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,100
sure that the Court of Justice of the

305
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,870
European Union will also the asking

306
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,490
question so it'd be very sensible if

307
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,439
both the European Union and the

308
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,759
Americans actually answered the

309
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,370
questions then the questions arise about

310
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,470
the lack of clarity within the

311
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,810
documentation around the justification

312
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,459
for bulk data collection the

313
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,439
independence on the over the Ombudsman

314
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,079
and by the way it is an ombudsman even

315
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,850
if the post holder is female it's a

316
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,069
Swedish word you can't suddenly put

317
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:49,709
person it into it European Ombudsman is

318
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,699
Emily O'Reilly the American Ombuds man

319
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,339
is is also a woman it's not a sexist

320
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,660
point it's just Swedish

321
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,910
so and the third point is that we were

322
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,759
concerned about processing of

323
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,589
information transferred to the states

324
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,899
which then moves on to to third

325
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,490
countries now these are perfectly

326
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,949
reasonable questions to ask and if there

327
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,420
aren't answers there's only going to be

328
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,779
trouble down the road so I would urge us

329
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,639
corporates who have a great interest in

330
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,889
getting this thing sorted out so we can

331
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,199
move on to other more constructive for

332
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,180
users of our time to have a word in the

333
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,420
air in the ear of the administration to

334
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,189
to get the answers to those questions

335
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:37,100
and then we can all move on safely

336
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,079
because the amount of data that's moving

337
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,540
between Europe and and estates is of

338
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,430
course massive and that's the that's

339
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,060
what underpins the prosperity on both

340
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,959
sides of the Atlantic so we need to get

341
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,300
on with that a final a final thought I

342
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,050
think really is that what what's driving

343
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,519
things at the information commissioner's

344
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,269
office at the moment is not just the

345
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:11,240
change of guard in fact the change of

346
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,480
guard is almost a peripheral because

347
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,779
you've got 400 people working away on

348
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,040
information rights both access to

349
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,740
information and enter data privacy and

350
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,899
the general data protection regulation

351
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,670
is absolutely the focus of our

352
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,529
activities that's what we're getting

353
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,930
ready for that's what we're gearing up

354
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,009
to it advise you about there's a whole

355
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,110
change program in the organization

356
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,629
designed to make sure that we can meet

357
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:41,839
our obligations under the under the

358
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,319
regulation to help you two to meet yours

359
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,800
and we have to work out how we fit in

360
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,050
with the European data protection board

361
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,610
and our colleagues in the article 29

362
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,439
working party and so on so that's really

363
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,899
the focus of event but at the end of

364
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,819
this month there is a change of guard

365
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,839
I'm really delighted that the

366
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,829
Commissioner for British Columbia

367
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:06,140
Elizabeth Denon has been identified as

368
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,539
the government's preferred candidate as

369
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:11,929
my successor I benefited hugely from

370
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:12,390
take

371
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,540
from Richard Thomas back in 2009 and

372
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,180
it's really great to see an experienced

373
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,000
a Privacy Commissioner like Elizabeth

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,959
denim being nominated she goes before a

375
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,180
parliamentary committee next week and

376
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,100
it's it's it's it's really really good

377
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,530
news at the ICO we've got a really good

378
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,190
team yes okay it was careless of me Lady

379
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,920
Bracknell was right I managed to lose to

380
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,360
Deputy Commissioner's but there's a

381
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,130
fantastic team still still in place that

382
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,110
will carry things forward absolutely

383
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,160
focused on the priorities that are of

384
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,450
great importance at this at this

385
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,850
difficult time and I know that Elizabeth

386
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,450
will be a great leader of the ICO and

387
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,660
we'll continue with the approach that

388
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,970
was developed by Richard Thomas carried

389
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,460
on by by myself to to to make sure that

390
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,190
the ICO is an effective partner in

391
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,970
delivering information rights in the UK

392
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,690
and an influential voice within within

393
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,730
Europe so that together we can find the

394
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,260
oil without the asbestos and hit the

395
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,630
stars without trashing the right of

396
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,520
citizens and consumers to get the

397
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,120
benefits of digital but also retain

398
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,900
their privacy their security and and

399
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,600
their respect so I wish you all the very

400
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,450
best of success in this very important

401
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,560
sector in which you work and ask you to

402
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,820
take back the message to your

403
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,320
organization that respecting information

404
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,190
rights is the sinner qua non for opening

405
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,980
up all the excitement's that the digital

406
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,650
world offers and if senior people in

407
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,410
organizations are not prepared to give

408
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,830
their time and attention to the rights

409
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,470
of consumers and citizens then they're

410
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,380
not going to end

411
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,950
oi the benefits and and the

412
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,730
opportunities and yes the profits of the

413
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,840
digital world thank you
