1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,410
for many many of us the first step

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,340
towards learning something that is

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,950
actually going to change our lives at

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,890
least professionally because this is it

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,440
it has happened whether we were

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,199
skeptical about it or not we have a

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,598
revelation which will be officially

8
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:35,780
adopted and published in the next few

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,379
months but it is already there and we

10
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:44,269
can say you have to provide contact

11
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,550
details but your data protection officer

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,820
I think that would be unwelcome for some

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,239
organizations you have to state the

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,479
legal basis for your processing and at

15
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,299
what as Eduardo mentioned if your legal

16
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,699
basis is legitimate interests you have

17
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,670
to explain what the interests are which

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,940
you're relying on you have to explain if

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,190
you are transferring data outside the

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,960
EEA

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,180
if you are what's the legal basis for

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,670
that so are you relying on consent

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,219
standard contractual clauses or another

24
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,310
delegation you have to explain to the

25
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,530
individual how they can obtain more

26
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,689
information about that so they know what

27
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,929
safeguards are in place you have to

28
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:33,049
explain the retention periods and if you

29
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,119
can't do that you have to say how you

30
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,999
are going to determine them you have to

31
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,399
explain the rights that the individual

32
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,740
has the right have complained to a data

33
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,740
protection officer and finally if you

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,079
have obtained the information indirectly

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,320
you have to explain the source of the

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,259
data as well and remember that you have

37
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:58,689
to do all this clearly and concisely and

38
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,549
in sort of plain English there was a lot

39
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,299
to get through at the moment we all know

40
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,068
this the law is twisted the law is

41
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,360
national subject to all sorts of

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,610
interpretations and if there was one

43
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,230
thing that the Commission wanted to

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,390
achieve was one set of rules for

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,750
everybody exactly the same and if there

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,410
is one thing you learn

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,110
in the next couple of days is that this

48
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,140
whole process of changing the legal

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,570
framework is driven by this number one

50
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,580
priority having this single set of rules

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,200
this is going to pose a challenge to

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
everybody just the sheer volume of

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,530
information that has to be shared with

54
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,520
individuals and it's going to be

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,440
difficult for everyone those of us who

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,630
have been working across the ocean the

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,280
key thing to explain if there's one

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,090
concept you can explain across the ocean

59
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,000
and get it right and then it will save

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,830
you a lot of trouble is the fact that

61
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,350
personal data of course goes beyond this

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,450
idea of PII personally identifiable

63
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,440
information and when you look at the

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,520
reciters of the regulation the recitals

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,440
try to make it really really clear there

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,140
is no room for hesitation it's an IP

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,120
address personal data is cookie data

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,020
personally no worries it is personal

69
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,030
data

70
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,630
so to recap whenever you are engaging

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,180
with individuals whether it's providing

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,490
information responding to access

73
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,000
requests or responding to objections you

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,780
have to be clear prompt careful and you

75
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,440
have to do it for free
