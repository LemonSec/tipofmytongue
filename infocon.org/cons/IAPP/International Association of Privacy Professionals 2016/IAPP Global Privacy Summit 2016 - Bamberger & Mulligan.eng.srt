um thank you it is such an honor to

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,780
decades privacy discussion has focused

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,870
on laws governing treatment of personal

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,829
information privacy on the books what it

12
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,309
says and what it should say but until

13
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,559
now we've had precious little insight

14
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,750
into how those words we've argued so

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,510
passionately about actually shape the

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,579
behavior of the companies that handle so

17
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,040
much of our data what affects their

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,409
understanding of privacy's meaning what

19
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,140
influences the practices they have or

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,689
don't have that they put in place to

21
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,600
protect privacy so we looked under the

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,680
hood to see what really mattered our

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,619
privacy on the ground project looked at

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,780
the corporate privacy leaders of five

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,299
different countries the United States

26
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,040
Germany France Spain and the UK we did

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,009
scores of interviews with chief privacy

28
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,650
and data protection officers with

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,079
engineers with lawyers with advocates

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,680
and regulators and it turns out that all

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
of this discussion about privacy on the

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,420
books all of these articles these

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,970
debates these hearings they missed

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,670
something crucial about what really

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,020
matters they missed you they missed the

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,540
crucial role of the privacy professional

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,689
it turns out that privacy professionals

38
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,180
like you your roles your respective

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,310
levels of power

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,590
an influence within the firm's your

41
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,510
level of access to your boards and

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,700
senior management your activities

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,800
outside the firm the way you interact

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,750
with the broader field of privacy

45
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,660
experts including regulators advocates

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,400
professional groups and your peers

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,130
communities like these are often the

48
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,260
factors that determine whether firms

49
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,870
have robust processes in place to

50
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,680
protect privacy robustly our book begins

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,040
with the story of Yahoo's 2004

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
disclosure to the Chinese government of

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,680
dissident journalists Cheetos identity

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,620
as the author of an email critical of

55
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,239
Beijing now that revelation led to she's

56
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,420
imprisonment it spawned widespread

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,780
public condemnation and US congressional

58
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,930
hearings these condom nations were felt

59
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,420
in boardrooms throughout silicon valley

60
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,860
and beyond now flash forward a number of

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,950
years and we see Yahoo in a pitched yet

62
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,549
secret battle opposing the NSA's demands

63
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,670
to turn over customer information under

64
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,500
their warrantless internet surveillance

65
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,400
program that time the company did the

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,560
right thing and was celebrated but why

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,739
the change the law on the books looked

68
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,100
remarkably similar but the company the

69
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,200
company had changed dramatically it

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,690
empowered and resourced its privacy and

71
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,000
law enforcement staff it had launched a

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,319
business and human rights program

73
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,389
covering privacy and freedom of

74
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:47,600
expression it had built privacy in and

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,030
when the government came knocking this

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,579
time Yahoo was ready to engage in an

77
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,319
important discussion about the interplay

78
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,889
between privacy and surveillance and

79
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,109
Yahoo's corporate evolution reflects

80
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,060
broader shifts that we found in our

81
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,239
research we got a window into an

82
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,630
incredible time because what you do now

83
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,380
is really special our work documents the

84
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,420
development of

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,959
an emerging set of global privacy best

86
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,440
practices arising most robustly in the

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,110
United States and Germany and all

88
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,419
centered around a particular type of

89
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:31,289
chief privacy or data protection officer

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,560
the critical attribute of these privacy

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,190
officers is that they span boundaries

92
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,620
they do this in three related ways first

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,080
their work literally spawns the

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,729
boundaries of the firm itself the

95
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,800
leading privacy professional spends as

96
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,190
much of her time outside as inside this

97
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,250
outward focus enables her to translate

98
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,530
the uncertain and dynamic requirements

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,919
of privacy as it's repeatedly reshaped

100
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,780
by regulators and advocates and

101
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,169
consumers and it helps mitigate risks

102
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:07,750
and avoids the firm being blindsided by

103
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,610
this constantly changing privacy

104
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,979
environment having one foot firmly

105
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,919
planted outside the corporation while

106
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,350
the other inside enhances the cpos

107
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,539
independence and importance and it

108
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,220
allows them to be the strategic

109
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,289
interpreter of this very complex and

110
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,860
evolving environment and second because

111
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,370
the cpos role in mediating between

112
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,430
external privacy demands and internal

113
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,430
corporate privacy practices their work

114
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,720
inside the organization also spans

115
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,820
strategy privacy as strategy and

116
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,979
operations privacy as management so on

117
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,350
the one hand they are expertise in

118
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,870
helping the firm translate the external

119
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,229
landscape helps secure a place at the

120
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:58,360
table when corporate decisions are made

121
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,960
and it helps to ensure a strategic role

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,440
for the CP o often from within the C

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,740
suite and on the other hand privacy

124
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,740
leaders must operationalize privacy all

125
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,530
the way down

126
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,750
evolving best practices of making you

127
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,080
privacy part of management through

128
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,290
distributed expertise the privacy

129
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,450
function can't just be siloed in one

130
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,390
individual or compliance unit privacy

131
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,340
decision-making must be integrated into

132
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,010
technology design business line

133
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,640
processes and privacy expertise and

134
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,710
responsibility must be distributed to

135
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,190
staff who are embedded within business

136
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,830
units so that it can be brought to bear

137
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,890
from the inside throughout the

138
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,100
development of data intensive processes

139
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,630
and systems third the leaving leading

140
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,370
privacy professionals pounds the

141
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,410
boundary between the firm's expertise

142
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,890
and that of society they bring

143
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,870
specialized expertise and knowledge

144
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,510
about their firms and deep working

145
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,640
relationships within it yet at the same

146
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,370
time they bring privacy commitments from

147
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,470
outside drawn from membership in a

148
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,690
community like this one built from the

149
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,520
knowledge of private sector leaders

150
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,860
government experts advocates and the

151
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,920
public they are in many ways the moral

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,200
conscience within the firm literally

153
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,260
bringing the outside perspective inside

154
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,680
to affect firm thinking and this all

155
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,800
raises the question where do we go from

156
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,640
here to be sure the privacy profession

157
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,450
will continue to grow the GDP are alone

158
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,690
is expected to necessitate 20,000 new

159
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,140
privacy and data protection officer jobs

160
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,990
over just the next three years and this

161
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,140
will certainly increase the trend of

162
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,870
making privacy part of management within

163
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,740
firms but this growth also creates

164
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,060
challenges managerial izing privacy is a

165
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,970
positive development no doubt yet as a

166
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,280
more resources are dedicated to making

167
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,950
privacy part of core operations how do

168
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,290
we make sure that privacy leadership the

169
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,560
role doesn't lose its

170
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,810
special character how do we make sure it

171
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,200

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,170
finished our research first subjects who

182
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,990
called themselves chief privacy officers

183
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,820
or data protection officers at the

184
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,860
beginning of our research now have it

185
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,200
expanded portfolio and in some instances

186
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,810
new titles reflecting this increased

machine learning artificial intelligence

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,410
and technologies we've yet to even dream

219
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,920
of these are the models that will serve
