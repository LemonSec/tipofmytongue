[Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,509
good morning everybody it's a real

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,870
pleasure and let me say a privilege to

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,650
be here with you after such a long night

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,130
and unexpected two year break the word

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,710
looks a lot different than it did in

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,840
November two years ago in ways which

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,300
none of us would have predicted few of

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,579
us would have predicted such a deadly

10
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,320
resurgence of terrorists in the hurt of

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,960
Europe that would have disrupted

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,690
everyday life in Belgium France and

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,570
other countries including of course the

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,350
cancellation of the last year's I EPP

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,010
Congress and few of us would have

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,890
predicted a consultative referendum in

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,830
the UK voting to leave the European

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,610
Union none of us would have predicted

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,460
such a colorful u.s. presidential

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,189
election so we may expect a new chapter

21
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,799
internationally speaking novelties we

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,140
will see to which stand there will also

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,810
be relevant for privacy and data

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,939
protection we might have predicted that

25
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,170
at long last d you would reach agreement

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,850
on the new data protection framework my

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,310
message to you today is short and simple

28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,950
get ready for the GDP are but continue

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,040
to expect the unexpected it is already

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,860
six months since the GDP are and the

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,930
police and judicial activities directive

32
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,250
became EU lo there are now 18 months to

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,560
go before they become fully applicable

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,878
in May 2018 that is 533 days to be fully

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,540
compliant with 1999 articles of the reg

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,420
and for the directive on police and

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,209
judicial activities which is extremely

38
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,939
relevant in terms of prevention

39
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,310
investigation detection and prosecution

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,829
of criminal offences member states have

41
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,069
a little bit less time to fully

42
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,489
transpose international law the deadline

43
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,980
as i know is 60 may 2018 2018 and this

44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,379
is a 3 million relevant for business

45
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,030
companies as well so the ball has been

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,310
dispatched by the legislators and now

47
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,180
it's firmly in the court of independent

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,290
regulators like us on the incoming panel

49
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,760
so our big challenge is to help

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,810
controllers to ensure that the abstract

51
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,780
letter of the law becomes a concrete

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,370
reality on the ground I said 99 articles

53
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,250
in 533 days make no mistake the GDP are

54
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,209
is here to stay for a long long time we

55
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,900
need to focus on what is desirable as

56
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,659
well as necessary but the perfect should

57
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,959
not be the enemy of the good my

58
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,199
institution the European data protection

59
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,440
supervisor was never a party to the

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,840
negotiations to or on the legislation

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,340
were we where as well as all other

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,720
independent data protection authorities

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
in the indie you fully engaged in

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,599
fulfilling our advisory role to the

65
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,209
college's letter and I think we were all

66
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,349
able to leverage our years of experience

67
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:04,689
as advisors to identify ways to improve

68
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:08,379
the text to focus more on safeguards for

69
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,650
individual and less on bureaucratic

70
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,540
procedures and you might recall that we

71
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,930
as the DPS we produce an app free to

72
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,259
download so that anyone can now more

73
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,110
easily compare the old directive and the

74
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,560
new

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,710
regulation one of our big priorities was

76
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,010
to make data protection simple and I'm

77
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,440
pleased to see that we were successful

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,730
to some extent 21 provisions for

79
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,889
implementing or delegated acts by the

80
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,990
European Commission we're replaced to

81
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,240
allow independent data protection

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,550
authorities to consider targeted and

83
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,470
relevant guidance for controllers and

84
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,800
processes and in the article 29 working

85
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,940
party as said by Isabel we we have the

86
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,610
unique opportunity now to prepare the

87
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,970
future to start developing a new gold

88
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,790
standard for forward-looking and

89
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,790
practical guidelines to be formalized by

90
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,510
the EDB be at the right moment so we

91
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,660
need to be ready for day one the outcome

92
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,690
needs to be user-friendly and draw from

93
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,780
best practices across the you and also

94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,030
outside d you so the process needs to

95
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,510
consult to be accessible and transparent

96
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,700
with stakeholders as you know this is

97
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,729
also now an obligation under the GDP our

98
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,880
article 70 point for our independence as

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,820
DPAs is precious and its value in in

100
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,520
this volatile age of big data mass

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
surveillance cannot be overstated we

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,110
have now extensive case low setting out

103
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,450
the requirements for functional and

104
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,169
visible independence from the executive

105
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,810
other rulings may be expected but

106
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,610
independence is not isolation no DPA

107
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,350
seeds in an ivory tower nor should they

108
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,610
we need to be convergent more conversant

109
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,979
with technology in order to better

110
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,380
assess the impact on personal data

111
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,060
processing and fundamental rights but we

112
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
also need to be conversant with

113
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,210
technology to enable more efficient and

114
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,160
inclusive discussions among ourselves as

115
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,110
a community of DPAs and we stakeholders

116
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,510
in this room and elsewhere we need to be

117
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,510
open

118
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,590
we need to establish a new normal for

119
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,910
discussion and debate with controllers

120
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,300
on the basis of accountability

121
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,140
accountability contains the notion that

122
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,930
failure to comply causing arms to

123
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,930
individual with irresponsible data

124
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,320
processing must be addressed and the GDP

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,580
are gives us the ability to apply this

126
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,060
onesie proportionate sanctions they must

127
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,660
be scalable of course just like the

128
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,150
obligations throughout the GDP are in

129
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,000
accordance with the riskiness of

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,400
processing operation we have discussed

131
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,260
together with colleagues for example how

132
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,320
to set the dial between core activities

133
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,620
and large-scale processing and how this

134
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,410
should influence whether a DPO should be

135
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,630
appointed and how to assist small and

136
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,900
medium enterprises who may not have the

137
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,690
resources to employ a dedicated dbo we

138
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,790
have been discussing the new rights to

139
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,760
data portability and the sectors in

140
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,610
which it would be relevant its

141
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,350
relationship with the consumer and

142
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,310
competition law we have also discussed

143
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,610
how to roll out data protection impact

144
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,520
assessment the types of risky processing

145
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,860
operation which would require one and we

146
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,830
have discussed also the role of

147
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,210
certification a really important

148
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,250
innovation in the GDP are for

149
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,440
accountable data controllers and for

150
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,930
rebuilding trust among individuals in

151
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,840
the area of deeper hyper-connectivity we

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,050
need to clarify the roles and

153
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,430
responsibilities of the various players

154
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,340
in this new arena in new including of

155
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,390
course dps the Commission and accredited

156
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,880
certifying bodies so the systems need to

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,270
be affordable more than everything this

158
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,770
system must be credible and people are

159
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,840
entitled to expect an acceptable

160
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,320
standard or protection and respect for

161
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,179
companies and governments handling their

162
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,330
personal data as they would expect from

163
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,970
someone handling your private property

164
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,010
or for handling

165
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,340
chains or using medicine this is an

166
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,920
uncertain period for society and an

167
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,660
economy Nassim Taleb in his 2007 book

168
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,310
Black Swan rights eloquently eloquently

169
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,940
how in predicting the future we tend to

170
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,880
ignore isolated events and negative

171
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,630
results and I think we ignore how people

172
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,820
are driven by infinity of instincts then

173
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,790
most of our history is silent and not

174
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,970
documented the European data protection

175
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,700
supervisor ethics advisory group is

176
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,430
working intensively on a set of

177
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,760
principles which one day can help

178
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
policymakers and even DPAs to to

179
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,520
navigate existential waters on what it

180
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,610
means to be human in an age of virtual

181
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,970
and enhanced reality and artificial

182
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,950
intelligence what it means dignity in

183
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,190
the 21st century so new ethical

184
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,040
questions are emerging all around us and

185
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
everyone is talking about the netflix

186
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,510
Sirius Black Mirror and its kaleidoscope

187
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,840
of technological list appears and one

188
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,540
episode your online reputation literally

189
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,420
determines the ability of people to

190
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,690
participate in society and economy at

191
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,930
any level it may seem ridiculous we know

192
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,570
the recent history of a UK insurance

193
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,840
company wanting to make use of social

194
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,330
media data in determining what policies

195
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,760
to offer to clients and we know about

196
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,960
the Social Credit initiative in China so

197
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,450
I think we have to build on the

198
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,760
technical and the legal framework which

199
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,790
is in place to shape technology and

200
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,850
revenue models it should not be other

201
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,260
way around so that is in gentlemen we

202
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,400
will probably come to gregs eat blacks

203
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,650
in discussion during the following panel

204
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,660
but even if one country will leave the

205
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,240
European Union it

206
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,010
doesn't mean it doesn't change in terms

207
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,459
of globalization there is a movement

208
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,649
against international flows and common

209
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,830
standards we see some tendencies around

210
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,480
the world about protectionism and and

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,850
therefore we must meet these challenges

212
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,020
on the basis of that data flows subject

213
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,680
to appropriate rules are also relevant

214
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,440
in terms of benefits to society and

215
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,680
individuals but respect for different

216
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,120
legal culture requires reciprocity

217
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,040
adequacy in the U is not in position and

218
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,130
data protection is not a trade Maria I

219
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,160
think there are opportunities for all to

220
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,820
build bridges and to learn from one

221
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,459
another thank you very much for your and

222
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,620
passion and I wish you and a successful

223
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,740
day
