[Music]

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,510
good morning to everyone what an amazing

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,750
audience you're right Peter the eye appt

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,200
every year so I'm happy to be with you

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,910
this morning to say a few words about

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,700
the future of data protection in Europe

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,210
we are and Peter Helsing just said it in

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,949
a critical period the GDP or has been

9
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,120
adopted and we have less than 18 month

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,949
to be ready may 2018 the countdown has

11
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,390
started for you and the new compliance

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,629
obligations that you will have and for

13
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:04,069
us DPS that we need to finalize a new

14
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,340
governance model issue guidance to

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,310
controllers and processors in order to

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,939
have a full harmonization so there is

17
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,670
clearly a lot of work and efforts in

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,509
front of us but I want to start by

19
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,070
saying that this is worth it because the

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,710
GDP our answers to the new needs and

21
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,390
trends we collectively have to pace

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,850
first it answers to the confidence

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,329
crisis that has emerged since the last

24
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,329
three years of course following the

25
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,829
Snowden revelations but more generally

26
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,630
confidence crisis of the consumers of

27
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,539
the individuals of the people's i would

28
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:53,179
say around the relationship they have

29
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,909
with you business representatives as

30
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,899
regard their data people are more and

31
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,509
more enabled to understand the complex

32
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,590
and fast evolving ecosystem they feel

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,038
they could be used by it and not in a

34
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,070
position to make their own choices they

35
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,150
want to be reassured the GDP our answers

36
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,110
to that by putting the individuals

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,230
at the center of the regulation in

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,030
particular by reinforcing their rights

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,230
or by recognizing new rights they like

40
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,890
the right to data portability but also

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,260
it answers through the new compliance

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,730
efforts that will be asked to you

43
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,470
compliance is no longer a pure legal and

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,130
sometimes let's say theoretical issue it

45
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,450
enters the business processes themselves

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,690
p I a GPO privacy by design and by

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,170
default a complex set of tools at your

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,230
disposal to manage your compliance in a

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,310
dynamic way obviously it will be more

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,270
demanding than in the past but again I

51
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,110
think it's a profitable investment it is

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,090
a profitable investment because in fact

53
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,959
a smart accountability system

54
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,750
transformed transforms conformity into a

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,450
competitive advantage it is a question

56
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,019
of reputation of consumer trust of

57
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,040
market values it also a way to diminish

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,190
the risk in terms of sanctions so it is

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,570
in your business interest to comply all

60
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,200
the DPAs want to help you to adapt to

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,350
this new environment for that we want to

62
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,019
clarify as much as possible the

63
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,080
obligations of the gdp are and sometimes

64
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,480
let's be honest the GDP are is a little

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,950
bit complex so the Working Party 29 is

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,040
working hard for the production of an

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,040
operational toolbox which we hope will

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,860
be user-friendly and will help you to

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,850
ensure compliance with the GDP are six

70
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,519
working groups and task forces have been

71
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,190
constituted and they are in action an

72
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,910
old EP a European DPA are committed and

73
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,400
we have adopted an action plan for this

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,640
year defining our first priorities and

75
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,520
in particular on four subjects on which

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,690
we want to issue guidelines for you

77
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,790
controllers and processors for

78
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,160
priorities the notion of high risk and

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,890
the data protection impact assessment

80
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,420
this is a new tool certification the

81
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,010
portability right I just mentioned and

82
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,690
the DPO let me insist on two of these

83
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,400
subjects the DPO they are several DPO in

84
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,220
the room I'm sure the why is it

85
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,470
important for us because we believe the

86
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,950
DPO is a kind of Chef darkest of the

87
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,890
tool box his role will be or her role

88
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,800
will be critical for the accountability

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,070
so the working body 29 wants to support

90
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,690
this function data portability because

91
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,990
it's a key leve to help individuals be

92
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,720
covering their sovereignty over the data

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,570
and rebalancing the asymmetrical

94
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,090
relationship between him and her and the

95
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,180
companies using the data data

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,880
portability is also important because it

97
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,910
offers avenues for innovation and new

98
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,140
services around the data on these two

99
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,350
subjects we will finalize the guidelines

100
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,230
of the Working Party 29 in December at

101
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,830
our plenary on the two other subject we

102
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,260
will publish guidelines in 2017 of

103
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,080
course besides guidelines to the

104
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,960
controllers and to the processors

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,420
another priority for us is to establish

106
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,890
our new governance model concretely what

107
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,500
is the new governance model it is

108
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,770
concretely how DPA are going to work

109
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,440
together on issues of common interest

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,710
and they are growing issues of common

111
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,460
interest between us DPS governance

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,370
European DPS governance has been

113
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,510
criticized in the past too heavy too

114
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,090
slow not harmonized between the

115
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,390
different european countries now we want

116
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,780
to be imaginative in line with the

117
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,240
very decentralized nature of the

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,900
internet but also efficient coping with

119
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,350
the need of global actors the GDP are

120
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,110
provides a very sophisticated system of

121
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,200
cooperation between DPS with four levels

122
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,770
of cooperation virtual assistant joint

123
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,250
operation etc we are currently in the

124
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,950
process of preparing all type of tools

125
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,500
necessary to make this cooperation

126
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,630
mechanism ready for 2018 from filling

127
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,330
forms to flow charts or step-by-step

128
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,230
procedures we also have to set the LDP

129
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,230
be last layer of our governance

130
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,970
governance model the EDP be European

131
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,460
data protection board will be a new

132
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,940
European body it will be responsible to

133
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,370
arbitrate disputes between the national

134
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,040
authorities and also to develop a

135
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,330
European doctrine this LD PB is a major

136
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,840
step forward in Europe it gives the

137
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,479
ability of the European data protection

138
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,400
community really to speak with one voice

139
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,840
on operational cases and on substantial

140
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,470
issues it will give a robust identity to

141
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,350
the privacy community in Europe we are

142
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,650
currently at the Working Party 29 level

143
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,260
developing all the procedures relating

144
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,419
to the creation and the functioning of

145
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,690
the LDP be in cooperation with the OD PS

146
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,660
that will provide the Secretariat of the

147
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,229
LDP be ladies and gentlemen you realize

148
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,530
this morning that the GDP are is in fact

149
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,650
a major cultural and operational changes

150
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,280
change in Europe under this new legal

151
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,039
framework DPS will have the ability to

152
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,429
express a common idea the shared vision

153
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,429
in Europe and to strengthen the European

154
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,620
sovereignity but at the same time we DPA

155
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,350
we don't want our community to be closed

156
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,400
and it will be my last my first final

157
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,250
remark we want to be open

158
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,430
to the outside of Europe and to create

159
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,120
interest inter ability all the more as

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,220
the GDP our has extra territorial reach

161
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,470
there for the working party 29 has

162
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,800
started to develop a closer

163
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,810
collaboration with our international

164
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,470
counterparts in particular recently with

165
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,460
a per the network of Asian Pacific

166
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,250
privacy authority in Singapore and later

167
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,880
this month we will meet in Mexico in the

168
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,710
past we have already been in close

169
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,610
contact with APEC members we will also

170
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,600
probably organized a meeting in May

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,580
around one of the meetings of the oecd

172
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,880
meeting in Paris without asian-pacific

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,370
colleagues in order to exchange on the

174
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,380
future gdp on my second final remark

175
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,780
will be to say that the DPAs won't be

176
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,750
able to succeed with the GDP are without

177
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,830
you as I said first we are in the same

178
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,700
boat in front of this huge effort so we

179
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,780
need your input as we organized in July

180
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,160
the first Fablab to discuss the 2016

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,490
priorities with EU representative from

182
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,130
the industry and from the civil society

183
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,330
and this fab lab went very well we need

184
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,710
to repeat the exercise for the next year

185
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,800
so I invite you again to contact the

186
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,710
presidency of the Working Party 29 team

187
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,650
and give information on what you think

188
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,240
is important is essential to discuss

189
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,330
within the Working Party 29 and what you

190
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,540
believe is needed to make this GDP are

191
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,080
more practical I'm convinced that we

192
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,630
must develop our guidelines with your

193
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,150
participation and I'm waiting for your

194
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,610
thoughts for the next year of the

195
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,760
Working Party 29 priority thank you to

196
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,180
