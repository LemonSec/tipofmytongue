1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,429
thanks so much thank you I have more red

2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,349
hair than in that picture that you just

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,840
saw up there good morning thank you for

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,089
inviting me to beautiful sunny London

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,199
how surprising so I'm going to provide

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,990
you today with a glimpse into the future

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,099
of cyber security and privacy as hackers

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,949
see it perhaps you'll find some of my

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,920
ideas controversial provocative but I'm

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,450
giving you an opportunity to consider

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,290
them and if you like I think that what

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,960
hackers have to suggest could make a

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,600
difference a world of difference for the

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
future of what you have to suggest your

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
customers partners patients and

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,980
everybody that cares about cyber

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,230
security and privacy so we're going to

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,949
talk about hacking the future and I

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,070
understand it might be a little bit

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,660
counterintuitive to trust a hacker but I

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,719
ask you to give me your trust for this

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,549
short time this morning so that I can

23
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,770
walk you through my world the hackers

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,630
world and suggest to you this

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,140
perspective if you choose to have other

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,460
perspectives afterwards that's

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,350
absolutely fine and I understand but

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,689
it's my job to give you an idea of the

29
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,670
hackers world so let's jump right in

30
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,590
there to talk about the future I'll

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,460
begin with the past about 20 years ago

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,170
about the same time that I first got

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,710
interested in digital security and the

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,200
online world this gentleman Nicholas

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,780
Negroponte a from the MIT Media Lab in

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,390
the United States provided his vision

37
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,970
for a digital future in the book which

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,970
he called being digital he had a lot of

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,530
different predictions in there but I'll

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,110
focus on just one prediction mr.

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,649
Negroponte I said that he predicts that

42
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,470
pretty soon bits and bytes of

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,740
information will control more aspects of

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,100
human society and human lives than

45
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,490
physical atoms and molecules sounds a

46
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,390
little bit like science fiction

47
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,209
definitely 20 years ago but that reality

48
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,540
is very soon coming true because as you

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,790
all know with connected

50
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,370
devices internet of everything and the

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,290
phones you have in your pockets bits and

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,879
bytes already matter to a lot of the

53
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,769
aspects of our life and digital

54
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,480
technology has already transformed so

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,640
many aspects of our life and it is

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,799
enabled fantastic things revolutions

57
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,549
technologies and changes to how we spend

58
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,030
our time online and offline and I'm

59
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,129
referring to some things also enabled by

60
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,560
this new digital world fantastic things

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,439
perhaps for some people like specialized

62
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,170
dating services now of course all of you

63
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,670
in this room have never heard about

64
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,609
Ashley medicine you've never used it but

65
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,290
your patience your clients your

66
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,220
customers have so I'm going to go out on

67
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,840
a limb and guess you heard about Ashley

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,180
medicine in the past year and its impact

69
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,569
on the on the world but for those few of

70
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,189
you that were living on Mars and had

71
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,689
nothing to do with this website will

72
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,669
give you brief introduction it's a

73
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,290
specialized dating service that allows

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,209
married people to meet with other

75
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,040
married people to conduct things that

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,169
married people can't do by themselves at

77
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,760
home with their other married partners

78
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,060
this was the most elegant way and the

79
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,769
family friendly way I could use to

80
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,659
describe it of course this company is

81
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,519
not shy about what they do and so their

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,889
sales slogan is very simple life is

83
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,280
short have an affair compelling but the

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,620
promise the this website brings to the

85
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,049
table is not just of illicit romantic

86
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,849
encounters it's the promise of

87
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:42,199
discretion anonymity secrecy discretion

88
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,150
guaranteed it's even in the image right

89
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,810
this was their big promise and as we all

90
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,949
knew this promise was broken very

91
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:53,959
dramatically last year when the team of

92
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,780
hackers decided to leak the entire

93
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,519
contents of the databases of this

94
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,040
company to the world wide web for those

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,569
of you I haven't heard about it about

96
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,819
the details of millions of users were

97
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,129
exposed including addresses and credit

98
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,290
card details and names and a few things

99
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,239
were discovered from this bridge number

100
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,509
one about 99% of the users the

101
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,370
registered users on the website were men

102
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,769
and the the remaining 1% were either

103
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,590
chat BOTS fake profiles or female

104
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,740
profiles create

105
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,020
by the owners of the website to try and

106
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,520
give the impression that women are

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,500
actually using this website so perhaps

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,360
that some good news of course there was

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,310
some other bad news for the people who

110
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,800
whose details were practically exposed

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,410
now you all heard about this story but i

112
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,150
wanna i want to ask you one quick

113
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,120
question have you considered why why did

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,740
the hackers calling themselves the

115
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,680
impact theme even decide to take down

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,419
this website in such a dramatic manner

117
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,259
all kinds of manifestos have come out

118
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,120
from this team the impact team that's

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
what they call themselves and they said

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,060
different things and i don't think it's

121
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,380
about protecting the sanctity of

122
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,240
marriage and no they don't work for the

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,620
Pope I don't think so but but here's one

124
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,090
interesting thing that I discovered when

125
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,620
I looked into the reasons the

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,960
motivations why were these hackers so

127
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,300
keen on exposing this website's very

128
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,310
poor privacy and security protections

129
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,280
here's why it's because of this Ashley

130
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,039
medicine had a feature in their service

131
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,460
called ghost erase and this feature was

132
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,729
a promise to their customers that if

133
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,500
they ever want to leave the website if

134
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,630
they ever want to stop doing whatever it

135
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,550
is they were doing and want to erase all

136
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,949
trace of ever using this website no

137
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,870
problem at all just pay us twenty

138
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,360
dollars and I think the hacker the

139
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,449
hackers took issue with this because if

140
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,639
Ashley medicine asks for people to pay

141
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,130
to be removed from the part from from

142
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,070
the platform who is extorting who here

143
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,740
is a very interesting question and so

144
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,810
and I think this detail about the Ashley

145
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,849
Madison story that is never discussed

146
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,460
openly I think it's worthwhile asking

147
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,990
wasn't okay that this company asked for

148
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,030
twenty dollars from people to be removed

149
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,699
wrong product isn't a little bit of a

150
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,500
problem when you can register online for

151
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,729
free discretion guaranteed come join the

152

fantastic adult derating lifestyle oh

153
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,270
you want to leave no problem twenty

154
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,759
dollars please a little bit of a

155
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,169
difficulty there I think and that's what

156
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,909
the hackers saw as well that's my

157
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,759
perspective at least of course you heard

158
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,400
that information is a commodity it's the

159
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,919
fuel running our future if information

160
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,020
is a commodity then they DS and

161
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,400
gentlemen I would like to offer you that

162
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,770
the hackers perspective is that try

163
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,259
see is a privilege it is not necessarily

164
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,660
a god-given right it is a privilege for

165
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,599
which people must pay with either their

166
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,699
time their effort in trying to set up

167
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,159
encryption or avoiding services like

168
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,229
Google Facebook etc that use your

169
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,330
information and give you a valuable

170
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,669
service in return or you pay by using

171
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,940
paid encryption and in premium web sites

172
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,979
and services or you pay with your time

173
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,389
and effort by staying off the grid

174
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,610
either way if you would like to have

175
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,580
privacy in the future hackers know that

176
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,530
this is a privilege that you have to

177
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,509
work hard for and hackers have always

178
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,789
known this this has always been my

179
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,009
perspective to me it's not new to

180
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,680
hackers it's not new at all companies

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,780
like Sony Pictures Entertainment that

182
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,669
who were hacked in the past year have

183
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,819
all also discovered the power of letting

184
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,440
the entire world see their information

185
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,419
and what that difference that can make

186
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,729
of course you all heard about the sony

187
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,069
pictures entertainment hack why were

188
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,979
they hacked because the North Koreans

189
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,050
this dislike their taste in dramatic

190
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,319
Hollywood narratives as you can imagine

191
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,940
i'm also not that keen on that

192
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,560
explanation i think there was a much

193
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,870
more nuanced much more complex story in

194
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,150
the background but here's why it matters

195
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,130
to you in the sony pictures

196
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,110
entertainment hack which by the way

197
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,690
created a lot of media buzz for a pretty

198
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,180
mediocre movie i think you would all

199
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,789
agree that we all heard about this movie

200
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:05,009
without watching it because of the hack

201
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,690
which makes me think that the North

202
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,550
Koreans didn't really hacked Sony to

203
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,380
prevent you from going to the movie but

204
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,539
something else happened the emails and

205
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,759
the entire correspondence of sony

206
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,229
pictures entertainment one of the

207
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,849
leading hollywood studios in the world

208
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:21,270
were all leaked online this sounds like

209
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,740
terrible news for people in your

210
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,110
profession but for people like shirley's

211
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,419
her own in the acting profession it was

212
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,060
actually some piece of good news in the

213
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,979
skies because sure least her own

214
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,140
fantastic actress she discovered in

215
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,289
these emails that were leaked that as a

216
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,690
female leading actress in her next

217
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,729
upcoming hollywood picture she wasn't

218
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,390
getting the same pay as the male

219
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,160
counterpart actor who was actually less

220
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,709
well-known less famous than she so she

221
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,150
actually used this information

222
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,480
to leverage equal pay for Hollywood

223
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,820
actresses everywhere fantastic news if

224
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,800
you're a Hollywood actress what's the

225
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,960
takeaway what's the takeaway for you and

226
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,640
me I think the takeaway from just these

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,470
two stories the dating industry actually

228
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,050
medicine and sony pictures entertainment

229
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,550
data preachers data breaches are

230
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,830
impacting all kinds of industries your

231
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,960
customers might be in the car business

232
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,190
they might be in the medical device

233
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,660
business they might be in the dating

234
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,920
business they might be in the coffee

235
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,810
shop business that the breaches will

236
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,430
have something to do with how they

237
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,170
conduct their business in the next few

238
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,290
years that's a guarantee maybe if your

239
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,480
Prime Minister or leading politician

240
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,820
data breaches are going to impact your

241
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,920
future and your career perhaps you've

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,110
all heard about the Panama leaks at this

243
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,600
point massive data breach from about two

244
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,540
weeks ago Prime Minister's losing their

245
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,170
jobs politicians facing protests because

246
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,020
the power of information is changing the

247
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,450
course of humanity sounds like a really

248
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,920
dramatic statement but it's true it's

249
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,870
absolutely true these data breaches are

250
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,630
making a difference for everyone hackers

251
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,180
know what the power of information is we

252
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,820
know how much we have to work hard if

253
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,410
you want to have privacy and security

254
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,840
and we know that privacy and security

255
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,170
are not ultimate destinations you don't

256
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,970
just get to someplace and that's it now

257
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,860
you're secure or your information is

258
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,130
private it's an ongoing journey it's a

259
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,430
struggle sometimes it's an effort and

260
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,170
this is I think why a lot of people fear

261
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,830
hackers hackers good and bad they remind

262
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,330
everyone they remind you when they

263
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,760
remind everyone out there just how

264
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,580
fragile this illusion of privacy and

265
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,710
security that we all rely on every day

266
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,620
to conduct our business so it makes us

267
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,320
fear hackers but we shouldn't throw away

268
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,090
the baby with the bathwater hackers have

269
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,250
some really good ideas one of them is

270
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,370
that privacy access and trust are

271
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,900
constantly shifting currencies of power

272
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,590
just like information is a commodity and

273
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,030
hackers realized that security and

274
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,200
privacy something you have to work for

275
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,380
it's not a god-given right if you don't

276
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,870
configure your servers if you don't

277
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,760
deploying encryption if you don't take

278
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,380
the time and effort to introduce

279
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,180
security and privacy into everything

280
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,160
that you

281
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,230
do you won't have it this is something

282
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,240
hackers know very well I learned this

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,360
lesson from another Hollywood actress

284
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,980
surprising as it might seem perhaps you

285
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,220
know her angelina jolie about 20 years

286
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,779
ago when i was first getting interested

287
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,209
in a hacker's world i saw a film from

288
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:23,959
1995 hackers anyone seen this movie here

289
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,819
i think it's a classic for those of you

290
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,009
who haven't please watch it fantastic

291
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,930
examples of how hackers can completely

292
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,959
ruin an FBI directors life but also do a

293
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,209
lot of fantastic things when I saw this

294
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,819
film and I was about 14 at a time 20

295
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,769
years ago I realized that all of this

296
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,079
stuff that I was doing taking apart my

297
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,420
computer and overclocking the cpu to

298
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,370
make it go faster that's kind of like a

299
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,379
geeks version of souping up your car in

300
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,040
the garage or trying to find all kinds

301
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,930
of web servers on the internet which was

302
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,509
a new thing for me in 95 finding these

303
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,069
web servers and getting past security

304
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,319
controls getting into hidden folders

305
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,379
trying to set up my own website using

306
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,279
HTML and pirated videos of the prodigy

307
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,759
yes I did do that well it was being it's

308
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,079
called being a hacker it's a thing that

309
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,759
people do it's a whole community of

310
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,560
hackers and Angelina Jolie is doing it

311
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,019
why shouldn't I I realized this was my

312
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,000
calling in life and very happy to say

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,560
thank you Miss Julie you saved me

314
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,810
because if I'm being completely honest

315
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,029
in the interest of transparency this is

316
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,889
pretty much how I looked like about 20

317
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,060
years ago a little bit more than 20

318
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,680
years ago now some of you sitting in the

319
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,139
front rows have now fun trying to

320
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,240
identify me in this picture any guesses

321
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,199
by the way I'll give you a spoiler any

322
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,089
guesses over here perhaps give you a

323
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,970
spoiler I didn't have the same hairstyle

324
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,990
so a lot of people are constantly

325
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,490
looking at you know there were a lot of

326
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,399
ladies with girls with fringes and bags

327
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,949
it's not me that's not me that's not me

328
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:56,089
that's not me so I did go to school that

329
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,149
day it's not a trick question but here

330
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,470
here's the honest-to-god truth that's me

331
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,519
and I was so much of a dork or nerd I

332
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,309
guess I looked like a little boy I would

333
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:13,059
go nowhere without my state-of-the-art

334
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,800
1993 Sony Walkman gadgets compute

335
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,510
were my best friend's gadgets were my

336
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,540
best friends some of them still are so I

337
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,820
really needed that signal from Angelina

338
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,100
Jolie to give me a meaning and a calling

339
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,990
for what I wanted to do with my life

340
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,300
which was called being a hacker I just

341
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,010
didn't realize it before I saw that film

342
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,589
since then thankfully Thank You mr. Lee

343
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,899
I've had a lovely career working with

344
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,370
some big companies you may have heard of

345
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,160
in some big Israeli government agencies

346
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,649
and technology companies then all

347
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,390
through my career working with these

348
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,250
organizations for more than a decade now

349
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,990
I've always tried to bring the hackers

350
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,180
perspective and I know the hackers

351
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,860
perspective is still you know when I

352
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,600
talk about hackers this is what you

353
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,790
think about this is what you see

354
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,690
remember I'm giving you a choice today

355
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,360
to change your mind I think hackers are

356
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,730
part of the immune system for the

357
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,220
technology age we need hackers they're a

358
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,620
crucial part a vital part of everybody's

359
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,339
future that's my perspective feel free

360
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,190
to disregard it but hackers will make a

361
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,990
difference for your future good and bad

362
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,690
so it's best not to ignore them it's

363
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,120
best not to ignore us better so that's

364
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,709
the choice this morning ladies and

365
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:25,589
gentlemen take it at your own risk but

366
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,350
I'm happy to give you more ideas more

367
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,240
good reasons why you should care about

368
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,190
what hackers have to bring to the table

369
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,950
and this is one really good reason I

370
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,550
think cyber security and privacy and the

371
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,040
future of our digital life does not

372
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,180
depend solely on secrets secrets are not

373
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,730
the only thing hackers care about in

374
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,040
fact there are one thing most hackers do

375
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,310
not necessarily care about anymore cyber

376
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,230
security in the future of privacy in my

377
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,180
personal opinion is going to be about

378
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,000
protecting our digital connected way of

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,190
life sometimes it could be very very

380
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,829
intimate for example if you happen to be

381
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,589
a diabetic patient and your life depends

382
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,709
on an embedded insulin insulin pump that

383
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,390
constantly monitors your blood sugar

384
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,550
levels and your insulin and administers

385
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,040
the correct amount of insulin as needed

386
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,410
all the time I hope you're not diabetic

387
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,120
patients but if you are you know that

388
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,949
these devices have been vastly improving

389
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,870
the lives of diabetic patients all

390
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,459
around the world this is a great piece

391
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,520
of technology unfortunately just like

392
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,010
the other new digital technology it can

393
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,870
be hacked by malicious hackers

394
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,660
thankfully good hackers like Barnaby

395
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,940
Jack one of my personal heroes are out

396
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,270
there to demonstrate the threats so that

397
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,010
we can spark a solution this is

398
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,230
something Barnaby Jack for you said four

399
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,050
years ago when he demonstrated using a

400
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,240
radio antenna to remotely send a signal

401
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,970
to such an insulin pump a signal that

402
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,970
directs the pump to completely dump any

403
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,370
remaining insulin into a patient's

404
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,250
bloodstream he never hurt a soul he

405
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,810
conducted this demonstration on a

406
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,000
see-through mannequin as you can see the

407
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,130
reason this attack was even possible was

408
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,550
because the medical device was not

409
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,920
authenticating the identity of the

410
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,070
transmitter sending those radio signals

411
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,210
because the company that makes these

412
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,860
medical devices never thought that

413
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,570
they're also a cyber security company

414
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,610
and I never thought about employing a

415
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,220
hackers perspective but they do so now

416
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,470
and in fact in the United States the FDA

417
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,050
now has guidelines and suggestions for

418
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,180
medical device companies to work with

419
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,100
hackers and learn from hacking

420
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,750
techniques so that they can prepare for

421
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,960
the future another example may be

422
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,990
something that more of you can relate to

423
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,580
these are some of my other hacker

424
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,370
friends Chris and Charlie you might have

425
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,600
heard about them in the news recently

426
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,970
because they have a very specific hobby

427
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,860
can you guess what their hobby is G

428
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,620
packing thank you very much yes I also

429
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,840
heart crypto if that's what's on your

430
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,270
laptop yes very much so you are correct

431
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,359
sir Charlie and Chris are into Jeep

432
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,579
hacking not just jeeps they've been

433
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,079
hacking all kinds of cars in the past

434
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,089
five years they've been trying to find

435
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,490
the most hackable cars out there and put

436
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,619
the information in the world so that

437
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,329
people can make a conscious decision and

438
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,030
so that automakers can make a difference

439
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,099
to their product because this is life

440
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,200
and death stuff it's not about secrets

441
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,800
they use their cellular signal to take

442
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,750
this Jeep off the road if you'd like to

443
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,120
see a demonstration the video is

444
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,560
available they conducted this

445
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,180
demonstration to a reporter from wired

446
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,150
the magazine wired and they used

447
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,340
remotely so they were not in the car or

448
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,780
nowhere near the car when they took it

449
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,610
off the road they also killed the engine

450
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,250
turned on the wipers and blasted the

451
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,170
music but this was probably the most

452
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,840
dramatic impact however nobody was hurt

453
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,050
in fact this attack on the jeep cherokee

454
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,170
2015 model led to a massive recall of

455
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,660
vehicles in the united states a recall

456
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,610
that allowed the company to fix the

457
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,940
problem now any guesses how the company

458
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,670
fixed this problem and i should say our

459
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,010
prizes so if you answer my questions

460
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,920
there are prizes okay or at least one

461
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,410
prize yes how do they fix the problem

462
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,540
and they did not cut the wireless

463
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,040
connection this was by the way not a

464
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,150
wireless connection but rather a

465
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,910
cellular a signal a lot of cars in the

466
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,500
united states now have studied our

467
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,290
technologies built in GM has OnStar

468
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,270
other car companies have other

469
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,710
technology so it was not cutting the

470
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,420
wireless or cellular connection other

471
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,080
guesses yes over there yes that is

472
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,020
absolutely correct so thank you sir and

473
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,810
you do win an award I which you will get

474
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,960
at the end at the solution the company

475
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,570
had further customers was to send people

476
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,330
in the post a thumb drive with a

477
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,110
software update for their car this is

478
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,400
going to be our connected future

479
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,770
software updates for our vehicles which

480
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,620
we have to implicitly trust where there

481
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,080
is no way for the person who owns the

482
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,520
vehicle to know what's in the software

483
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,350
update what they are agreeing to now

484
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,150
perhaps this new software now tracks

485
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,190
their location identifies what's their

486
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,830
favorite Starbucks branch for example or

487
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,190
any other kind of personal preference so

488
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,660
that's the future software updates for

489
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,610
your cars of course some people get to

490
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,080
the office in something nicer than a

491
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,030
Jeep Cherokee perhaps an 80 million

492
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,910
dollar super act so this is a super yak

493
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,280
the White Rose of the Adriatic as you

494
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,870
can already guess what I'm getting it

495
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,100
this fantastic craft is also susceptible

496
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,430
to attacks remote attacks specifically

497
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,000
using a spoofed GPS signal GPS the

498
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,710
global positioning system the satellite

499
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,279
navigation system we all

500
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,119
lie on military aircraft relies on naval

501
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,309
vessels rely on the same signal system

502
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,529
generally speaking and the the

503
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:03,729
researchers from the University of

504
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:05,799
Austin in Texas were able to simply send

505
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,469
this boat a spoofed GPS signal that

506
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:10,479
would take it a few degrees of course

507
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,669
once again because the boat does not

508
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,219
verify the identity of where it is

509
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,229
getting this signal from it is

510
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:18,759
sufficient that the signal is strong

511
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,049
enough and stronger than the one

512
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,879
received from the legitimate satellites

513
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,669
to take the vehicle of course this is

514
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:26,259
this was already demonstrated three

515
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,029
years ago in case you think this is a

516
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,729
science fiction or our future forward

517
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,429
technologies okay what about webcams

518
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,499
some of you have webcams perhaps in your

519
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,450
homes or offices your customers premises

520
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,389
and you are told by the previous speaker

521
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,580
that hackers and criminals will get into

522
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,320
these webcams so that they can look at

523
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,049
you I have news for you you are not

524
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:50,139
interesting to look at I have looked

525
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,029
through many webcams I've read a lot of

526
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:53,950
people's emails they are most always

527
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,519
boring this is why criminals hack into

528
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,769
webcams because these webcams are always

529
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:02,049
on they have high bandwidth connections

530
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,210
to the Internet they can be used to

531
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,429
attack other people's computers other

532
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,710
people's servers other people's devices

533
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,779
this is what it is Rayleigh security

534
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:12,519
company discovered in their own backyard

535
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,460
a botnet that means an infected network

536
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,339
of webcams that was being used to attack

537
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,190
servers all over the world now let's say

538
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,809
you have nothing to hide or your

539
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,009
customers have nothing to hide their

540
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,450
happy to have people look through the

541
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,580
web cams all day long transparency as a

542
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,159
value that's great what about preventing

543
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,710
people from using their devices to

544
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,869
attack other people's coffee machines

545
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:38,919
web servers connected cars this is going

546
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,019
to be part of our connected future I

547
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:43,570
have another question for you anyone can

548
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,789
tell me what this is there are hints in

549
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:50,529
the picture what's that it's the

550
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:53,349
internet you say well thank you you are

551
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:57,210
almost accurate this is an image of

552
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,070
websites and web servers so I think by

553
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,779
this point you all understand that the

554
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,440
web and the Internet are two and kind of

555
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,190
different things so the web is something

556
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,780
that we browse and that we experience

557
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,880
online but the internet is much broader

558
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,980
it includes web cams it includes

559
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,390
connected coffee machines it includes

560
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,510
databases and organizational networks

561
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,030
that are not visible on the web the

562
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,830
World Wide Web this is an image from the

563
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,960
web you are correct about that but it is

564
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,680
from about 10 years ago fairly we know

565
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,210
not organized but a fairly

566
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,520
understandable ecosystem for about 10

567
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,890
years ago if I try to show you an image

568
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,830
of the internet right now the Internet

569
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,300
including the world wide web and

570
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,770
including all of the connected devices

571
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,230
that are potentially on it it would look

572
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,050
more like our galaxy the Milky Way and

573
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,470
it would have disparate planets and dark

574
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,970
spots where we don't know what's

575
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,920
happening and it will have its own

576
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,380
constellations this is probably more

577
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,990
accurately a depiction of our connected

578
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,790
future and it reads much more than just

579
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,910
the visible world wide web so it would

580
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,940
be easy and terrifying to get lost in

581
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,550
this world thankfully hackers to the

582
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,010
rescue once again this is a fantastic

583
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,410
search engine for internet-connected

584
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,770
devices it is called Shaw done like the

585
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,920
black belt in karate show done dot IO if

586
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,420
you're not yet familiar with this

587
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,760
fantastic tool I recommend signing up

588
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,000
and trying it for free or getting a

589
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,980
enterprise user account it was started

590
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,140
by one hacker from originally from

591
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,150
Austin Texas now he works in San Diego

592
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,910
his name is John Matthew Lee he is known

593
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,430
on Twitter as achillion and he calls

594
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,790
himself an Internet cartographer which i

595
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,310
think is fantastic Jordan is a website

596
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,020
or search engine rather that lets you

597
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,060
browse the connected internet for

598
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,180
devices webcams wind turbines connected

599
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,630
coffee machines if you find them however

600
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,100
it can be used for a lot more than that

601
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,070
so quite recently John discovered that

602
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,340
these devices are not the only thing

603
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,230
responding to his searches online he

604
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,470
also identified about 50 terabytes or

605
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,780
I'm sorry perhaps it was even petabytes

606
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,510
a greater amount of data residing on

607
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,930
vast databases from some of the most

608
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,930
popular database brands such as MongoDB

609
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,700
which you might be familiar with or your

610
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,380
customers are

611
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,290
using John was able to identify that

612
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,680
these databases were absolutely exposed

613
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,010
and speaking to the World Wide Web

614
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,480
responding to requests for information

615
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,700
and he downloaded vast amounts of

616
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,890
information from these databases just to

617
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,050
prove the point he keeps talking about

618
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,200
this it's not just the data stupid but

619
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
it's also about the data and I suggest

620
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,950
you take a look at his research findings

621
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,750
online because this is a tool you can

622
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,210
all use in your network environments for

623
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,160
your customers to show them just exposed

624
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,040
they might be so we was on those front

625
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,260
lines of this ecosystem who is with us

626
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,630
in this galaxy good people and bad

627
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,840
people of course but some of us think

628
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,740
that there are good people saving us

629
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,020
fierce cyber warriors at the edges

630
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,900
fending off cyber attacks perhaps they

631
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,000
work for your government perhaps they

632
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,590
work for my government either way

633
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,360
somebody's paying the taxes that pays

634
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,030
their salaries and these chaps or ladies

635
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,490
are protecting us all well again I would

636
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,710
like to suggest think again because even

637
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,330
the world's biggest and most well-funded

638
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,490
security agency the National Security

639
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,100
Agency in the United States is doing a

640
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,610
lot more to harm people's privacy then

641
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,410
you might expect from a security agency

642
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,480
for example in the past few years

643
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,080
they've spent millions of dollars on

644
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,510
software vulnerabilities that means bugs

645
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,060
or exploits that can be used to conduct

646
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,250
espionage and they didn't necessarily

647
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,650
tell the companies or the organizations

648
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,600
involved about their findings rather

649
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,760
they used it for espionage and I

650
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,380
understand that it makes sense from

651
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,450
their point of view so how many of you

652
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,460
heard about the heartbleed SSL

653
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,860
vulnerability last year some of you have

654
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,660
even those of you who haven't heard

655
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,100
about heartbleed which was a

656
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,740
vulnerability in the openssl software

657
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,050
library I can guarantee you personally

658
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,420
guarantee you that you have used SSL in

659
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,730
the past five to ten years everybody

660
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,250
uses ssl Americans users cell of course

661
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,460
but the NSA knew about the problems in

662
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,740
SSL heartbleed they knew about this

663
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,170
vulnerability at least two years before

664
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,940
the rest of the world find out which

665
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,890
means they actively kept American

666
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,440
companies at risk as well for about two

667
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,250
years

668
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,490
so they might be making your job harder

669
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,510
even if they're doing their job

670
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,460
according to what their mandate is

671
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,820
they're making all of our jobs harder

672
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,860
security is not about these edges and

673
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,810
fear cyber warriors at the checkpoints

674
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,790
it's about all of us and it's about the

675
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,470
personal choices that people make when

676
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,030
they install a new app when they provide

677
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,310
their details when they click I agree

678
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,500
and I read and agree the terms of use

679
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,750
which you all know is the biggest lie on

680
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,550
the internet because other the new

681
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,410
people here in the room nobody reads the

682
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,540
terms of use and I would venture a bet

683
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,580
that perhaps even some of you did not

684
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,680
read all of the terms of use of all of

685
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,560
the services you agreed to use online so

686
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,210
it's about the choices we make every day

687
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,640
we are customers or partners we all make

688
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,890
should we keep calm and carry on and

689
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,350
brace for impact brace for more data

690
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,630
breaches brace for no privacy at all I

691
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,730
would suggest to do what hackers are

692
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,320
doing which is understand that security

693
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,840
and privacy take time they take effort

694
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,240
they take strategy they're not going to

695
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,070
happen by the way most of all they

696
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,560
require us to share collaborate and

697
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,410
innovate because the bad guys surely are

698
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,260
doing this that collaborating and

699
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,580
innovating and sharing their knowledge

700
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,040
and their product without any burden at

701
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,070
all so we should do just the same and

702
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,660
this might be again counterintuitive for

703
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,820
you all to encourage your customers to

704
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,430
talk about the data breaches that

705
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,040
happened in their organizations but this

706
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,570
is one of the best ways to make

707
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,840
everybody safer for example how many of

708
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,600
you had had instances of ransomware in

709
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,060
your organization's company's homes

710
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,820
ransomware it's a new nasty very good

711
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,110
thing thank you for being brave and

712
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,280
saying it I don't think there's any

713
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,110
reason to be embarrassed that you've hit

714
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,120
you've been hit by ransomware ransomware

715
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,340
is an extremely popular new type of

716
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,290
malware that will encrypt your computer

717
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,040
and require ransom to release the

718
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,480
decryption key so that you can get your

719
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,420
files back in other words the criminals

720
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,780
that run ransomware campaigns don't care

721
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,370
about their information you don't care

722
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,320
about your details they care that you

723
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,720
care enough to pay them back for the

724
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
ransom they care that your customers

725
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,050
will pay enough to pay the one thousand

726
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,179
dollar two-thousand-dollar sometimes

727
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,370
seventeen thousand dollar ransom in some

728
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,150
cases

729
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,010
but by sharing and saying hey we had

730
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,780
this infection we've had this breach

731
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,600
we've had this incident and talking to

732
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,340
other organizations we can prevent the

733
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,080
next one so this is why I actually

734
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,820
encouraged actively encourage companies

735
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,190
and organizations to share details of

736
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,320
what happened to them and they're even

737
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,280
Taylor Swift degrees I hope so perhaps

738
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,020
you heard that Taylor Swift popular

739
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,900
American pop singer in the past year or

740
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,760
two years she already had her own

741
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,179
personal iCloud account hacked some of

742
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,070
her text messages from Apple were

743
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,770
released now again two fantastic things

744
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,750
that I took away from the story number

745
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,630
one Taylor Swift knows that her brand is

746
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,030
family friendly and so in all of our

747
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,710
text messages you will not find anything

748
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,190
incriminating or embarrassing she's

749
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,429
absolutely sweet and caring and kind to

750
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:39,500
her friends in her text messages as if

751
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,200
it was curated for release to the public

752
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,970
as if these are the lyrics to her next

753
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,970
song I don't know if it is by chance or

754
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,710
is she really DISA fantic but it's

755
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,120
fantastic because this is part of her

756
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,580
brand people trust her imagine Taylor

757
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,350
Swift's files were released to the

758
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,760
public and everybody discovers she's a

759
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,650
horrible divine a terrible individual

760
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,990
would that make her sales go up i'm not

761
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,150
sure but the second interesting thing I

762
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,980
took away from this story is that a new

763
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,900
Twitter account popped up on Twitter

764
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,750
it's called Swift on security and it

765
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,540
uses the persona of Taylor Swift to talk

766
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,520
about cyber security and privacy and

767
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,460
provide advice so if you have customers

768
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,290
or perhaps daughters and nephews and

769
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,610
nieces and people that like Taylor Swift

770
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,700
you can use the Taylor Swift persona to

771
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,100
talk to them about cyber security

772
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,179
because it is about all of us it's not

773
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,460
about fierce cyber warriors standing on

774
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,200
the you know borders there are no

775
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,290
borders anyway perhaps there is only a

776
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,910
gap not a border a gap between security

777
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,260
professionals and hackers and how the

778
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,450
rest of us see how are the rest of you

779
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,049
see the world so I have little a few

780
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,880
more pieces of advice for you this is a

781
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,429
really useful website called have I been

782
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,700
owned calm you will notice the owned is

783
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,220
spelled with P it is a hacker slag have

784
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,620
I been pwned but it means owned have I

785
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,190
been breached that I've been happy

786
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,530
it is a very useful website started by

787
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,930
security researcher and a Microsoft

788
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,270
professional by the name of Troy hunt he

789
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,850
created this tool to aggregate usernames

790
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,920
and passwords that were breached from a

791
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,930
lot of different websites so from the

792
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,510
adobe adobe com hack from the Ashley

793
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,160
Madison hack from a lot of different

794
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,980
websites and services what this website

795
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,960
is useful for except for looking up your

796
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,960
own details is to identify one of the

797
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,880
biggest problems which I'm sure impacts

798
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,800
your organizations or businesses right

799
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,310
now it is the problem of recycling and

800
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,810
i'm not talking about recycling plastic

801
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,790
bottles it is the problem of recycling

802
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,790
passwords everybody recycles passwords

803
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,830
it is perhaps the most popular form of

804
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,780
recycling on the planet at the moment

805
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,780
and in fact this is a problem for you

806
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,730
because when some person uses some

807
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,500
customer uses the same password for

808
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,810
their adobe.com account the Ashley

809
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,910
Madison account and their enterprise

810
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,490
account that makes it a lot easier for

811
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,170
criminals to get into your company and

812
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,350
organization and you can take a look at

813
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,790
this website you'll identify some of the

814
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,080
most popular passwords you are

815
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,000
identified some companies that you know

816
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,620
some enterprises that perhaps you work

817
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,250
with take a look it's a very useful tool

818
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,660
few more points for you this morning

819
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,880
cyber security is about the dating

820
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,620
industry it's about cars it's about

821
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,780
medical devices it's about Hollywood

822
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,790
studios it's about every business

823
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,320
globally doesn't matter what industry

824
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,930
you're in except for help perhaps for

825
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,660
the Amish preachers I don't want to be

826
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,980
offensive to anyone but I heard they

827
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,200
also have smartphones now so perhaps

828
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,500
it's also part of their future as well

829
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,470
that's why the internet needs you not to

830
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,420
grow cool facial hair and join the

831
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,510
cavalry but rather to help protect your

832
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,090
customers and your partners and I would

833
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,220
like to suggest suggest one final point

834
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,310
that could help you do so and I'll take

835
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,110
a point from this gentleman and I don't

836
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,610
normally agree with this gentleman

837
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,130
because he is the former head of the NSA

838
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,560
and the command the the US Cyber Command

839
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,920
chief general Keith Alexander four-star

840
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,590
general four years ago I saw him present

841
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,180
at DEFCON which is the world's largest

842
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,720
gathering of hackers on the planet and

843
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,870
for this conference he took off his

844
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,180
general uniform and put on the hackers

845
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,180
uniform black t-shirt and jeans to give

846
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,380
a hiring pitch in this room right here

847
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,800
is the talent our nation needs this is

848
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,270
what general Alexander had to say to the

849
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,190
hackers four years ago one year before

850
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,890
Snowden of course hackers in the room

851
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,100
said well then stop arresting us we'd

852
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,680
love the work for you it took them a few

853
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,080
more years but just last month the DoD

854
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,210
the Pentagon d United States Tod

855
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,040
announced a program called hack the

856
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,840
Pentagon where they are actively

857
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,030
inviting hackers to collaborate with

858
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,620
them and fight problems in their code

859
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,110
and I think that is fantastic it took

860
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,640
them some years it took some time to get

861
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
over general Alexander's latency and the

862
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,550
Snowden drama but here's an idea for you

863
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,410
and for your nieces nephews daughters

864
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,800
grand kids etc Cisco says that the

865
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,600
future is going to need 1,000,000 more

866
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,690
security professionals great news for

867
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,480
you job security but it means that our

868
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,418
industry our community needs more good

869
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:15,889
hackers and I think they're going to

870
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,810
come from my neck of the woods I think

871
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,070
they're going to come from the DEFCON

872
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,290
hacker community and from the global

873
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,260
movement of positive hackers because

874
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,550
hackers have the talent and the

875
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,889
technology that we all need some of them

876
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,000
create technologies that we all use

877
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,320
every day Tesla is one fantastic example

878
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,389
of a company I like to talk about they

879
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,610
are an innovative electric car via a car

880
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,050
company they do everything differently

881
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,199
and so that same year 2012 the same year

882
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,980
that general Alexander came with great

883
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,060
grandstanding and invited hackers to

884
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,219
collaborate Tesla brought their flagship

885
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,010
model the model s to Las Vegas and they

886
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,350
said to hackers please come play with

887
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,690
our car test us we would like to work

888
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,730
with you we are actively seeking your

889
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,330
collaboration so you know really

890
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,010
practicing what they preach I think and

891
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,590
they're not the only ones companies

892
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,480
around the world are now facilitating

893
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,110
bug bounty programs bug bounty programs

894
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,790
these are ways for companies to work

895
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,800
with hackers some of the biggest

896
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,510
companies on the planet are doing this

897
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,440
facebook yahoo microsoft samsung ebay

898
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,960
western union medical device companies

899
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,290
car companies financial

900
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,240
institutions this is actually my

901
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,730
specific topic of research at the moment

902
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,260
at Tel Aviv University's new

903
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,480
interdisciplinary cyber research center

904
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,580
looking at these bug bounty programs and

905
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,380
understanding how companies can make the

906
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,290
most value out of them this is also

907
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,870
creating a new class if you will or new

908
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,600
and you are niche for security

909
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,000
professionals to become professional bug

910
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
hunters and professional bug bounty

911
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,490
managers so the lady on the left is

912
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,990
Marianne she is a professional bug

913
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,940
hunter from Vienna and the lady on the

914
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,130
right is Katie missouri's who managed

915
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,650
Microsoft's bug bounty program and then

916
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,990
helped start hacker one which is one of

917
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,790
the biggest bug bounty companies in the

918
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,560
world right now it's a new breed of

919
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,750
hackers if you will that are out there

920
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,300
to help you do your work even if you

921
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,130
don't know about them this is an Israeli

922
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,950
hacker his name is near goldschlager

923
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,990
Neal was fairly anonymous in Israel as a

924
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,050
hacker but after winning the facebook

925
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,480
hacking competition each year in a row

926
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,000
for three years not only did he make it

927
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,310
to the top ten lists at Facebook and was

928
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,800
invited and offered the job there he was

929
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,840
actually offered a competing job for

930
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,820
another company and moved to California

931
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,280
so bug bounties also helping companies

932
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,160
hire and attract talent from all over

933
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,280
the world in completely new ways perhaps

934
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,740
some another another point for positive

935
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,210
positive positive in okay I need to take

936
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:58,710
a drink hold on right all better now so

937
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,110
my point was another point of positive

938
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,270
him and optimism for you this morning

939
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,920
more than a hundred years ago a US

940
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
Supreme Court justice justice brandeis

941
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
said something which I find very

942
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,940
inspiring he said that there is no

943
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,460
better disinfectant than the light of

944
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,880
day and that transparency can be a cure

945
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,810
to many social illnesses personally as a

946
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,210
hacker I have to agree although I see

947
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,210
the inherent conflict between

948
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,790
transparency and privacy I hope that we

949
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,440
can figure out ways to make both of

950
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,320
these work in the future but until we

951
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,380
get there

952
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,490
we have to dance like nobody is watching

953
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,790
but encrypt like everybody is that's the

954
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,770
best piece of advice I hacker can give

955
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,960
you any time and so with that I'd like

956
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,900
to say that okay I have one more point

957
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,880
sorry I would like to say that thanks to

958
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,890
hackers like Moxie Marlinspike and

959
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,630
Nico's cell you may have never heard

960
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,640
about these hackers but the hacker to

961
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,410
the left Moxie is helping develop the

962
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,760
encryption technologies that are now

963
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,130
rolled out through whatsapp and Nico

964
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,840
cell founded the company called wicker

965
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,720
which is an encrypted private messaging

966
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,760
app these technologies like encrypting

967
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,320
whatsapp and private messenger gaps are

968
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,850
making it easier for people to encrypt

969
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,800
which is good because encryption is hard

970
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,460
for some reason so that future is here I

971
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,740
hope you are ready thank you very much
