1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,059
thanks Jeff for the intro and and

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,120
Brendan I think he's gone so that was a

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,870
great talk

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,750
and a great introduction to some of the

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,490
topics we'll talk about for the rest of

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,189
the the workshop my name is Doug Miller

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,430
I've been a consultant independent

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,830
consultant for the last 12 years really

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,740
focused in the areas of cloud computing

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,750
cross-platform interoperability identity

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,850
management and looking at it from both

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,920
the technology point of view as well as

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,760
how it impacts privacy and security

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,020
before that I worked at Microsoft for

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,690
five years and you know been in this

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,480
industry for gee over 30 years started

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,870
out as a UNIX programmer and I sort of

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,489
seeing all the different waves that have

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,079
happened in technology and server

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,329
computing platforms and now cloud

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,360
computing so what I'm going to be

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,960
talking about today is really you know

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,300
the cloud and both the good and the bad

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,920
and some of the challenges that we have

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,610
related to compliance Greg and others

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,260
will talk about some of the nitty-gritty

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,000
of compliance in the cloud but I wanted

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,220
to sort of start with a kind of a

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,799
reference point you know what is the

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,330
cloud opportunity I think we all

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,460
recognize that it's kind of inevitable

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,400
you know what is the cloud and it may

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
seem obvious but it's probably worth

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,750
having the discussion where is the cloud

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,000
which becomes important when you're

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,829
talking about compliance and whose laws

37
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,229
apply and and then some of the

38
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,700
particular challenges related to

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,320
compliance in the cloud so an

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,530
interesting number here 89% of

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,619
enterprises will be using cloud services

42
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,689
by the end of this year that's a that's

43
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,570
a pretty amazing number when you when

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,640
you think about cloud computing hasn't

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,729
been around that long and cloud is a

46
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,810
little different than a lot of

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,229
technology evolutions that we've had if

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,969
you look back at you know server

49
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,220
computing and clients are computing and

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,080
and the various models that have have

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
come about most of them have been very

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
technical

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,900
they've been things that you know

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,060
computer scientists and computer

55
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,600
engineers are focused on working with in

56
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,950
order to provide some sort of solution

57
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,290
for a business the big difference with

58
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,980
cloud is it's so simple and it provides

59
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,560
so many economic benefits as well as

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,440
complexity reducing complexity benefits

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,050
that just about anybody can jump on the

62
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,870
cloud now and in fact one thing that you

63
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,370
know is concerning probably a lot of

64
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,830
people in the room is you know who is

65
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,190
using the cloud inside my organization

66
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,300
who's using a cloud that I haven't

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,610
sanctioned you know how many people have

68
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,060
a Dropbox account but it's not offered

69
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,220
by their organizations to somewhere

70
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,200
where they store files sometimes these

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,110
are sensitive files so all of these kind

72
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,180
of raise questions about compliance how

73
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,880
do we kind of adopt the cloud get all

74
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,650
the benefits but also have some control

75
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,560
over it so some of the benefits of

76
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,330
course the idea of being able to scale

77
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,880
up scale down as you need compute

78
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,860
resources and pay for what you use as

79
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,930
opposed to investing on a whole lot of

80
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,989
computers and data centers and and the

81
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,150
ability to handoff the complexity to a

82
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,400
cloud vendor and when you think about it

83
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,829
most businesses are not IT businesses

84
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,630
you know they're hospitals or insurance

85
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,019
companies or banks or whatever you know

86
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,370
they don't want to spend their whole

87
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,980
time administering IT they just want to

88
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,350
get on with their business so the idea

89
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,030
of this model where you handoff the

90
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,640
complexity in the IT management to

91
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,370
people who do that for a living has huge

92
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,410
attraction for businesses of all size

93
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,239
whether you're a little small business

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,130
wanting to outsource your email or

95
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,810
whether you're a large corporation

96
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,790
wanting to do for instance business

97
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,970
analytics and a large amount of data so

98
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,489
all of these are big drivers but there

99
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,170
are concerns that are still there and

100
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,750
many of those concerns are over trust

101
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,900
who has access to my data how will it be

102
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,250
used what happens if if the the data is

103
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,750
breached

104
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,149
can the club provider provide better

105
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,000
security than I can and can the cloud

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,520
provider provide better compliance with

107
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,050
all the rules and regulations that I

108
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,789
need to comply with in order to do my

109
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:26,750
business

110
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,710
so we'll go through some of these

111
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,870
questions and answers throughout the

112
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,040
rest of the the sessions today and just

113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,710
you know look at before we sort of leave

114
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,360
the opportunity look at what some of the

115
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,870
analysts are saying about the cloud you

116
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,030
know if you're resisting cloud because

117
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,100
of security concerns you're running out

118
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,950
of excuses and and so basically we're

119
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,800
now at the point where cloud vendors any

120
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,630
of the big cloud vendors can offer

121
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,030
better security than what many of us can

122
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,890
do regardless of the size of our

123
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,440
organization the question is no longer

124
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,530
how do I move to the cloud instead it's

125
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,320
now I'm in the cloud how do I make sure

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,020
I've optimized my investment and risk

127
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,980
exposure and so that's a big question

128
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,060
you know a lot of people talk about the

129
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,950
idea of transferring risk if you go to

130
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,169
the cloud you can transfer some of your

131
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,150
risk to the cloud provider if they're

132
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,800
taking responsibility for things like

133
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,610
compliance with regulations by 2020 we

134
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,340
will stop referring to the public cloud

135
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,340
and the private cloud will simply talk

136
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,850
about it as a way of doing business and

137
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,260
you know right now we sort of talk about

138
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,120
different models of cloud computing but

139
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,740
ultimately it's just going to be a

140
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,930
service that we sign up for and we won't

141
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,810
think about the particular underlying

142
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,320
technology that actually gets us there I

143
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,450
wanted to highlight this study just for

144
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,979
a sec it's a little hard to read the

145
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,600
text and I will blow up the kind of the

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,930
important point there but this is a

147
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,880
study that Microsoft just commissioned

148
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,380
before store and hasn't been published

149
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,810
yet so I had to get special permission

150
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,150
to be able to show you this one slide

151
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,370
but what it is is you know the drivers

152
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,210
why are people thinking about cloud and

153
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,770
you know you probably can't read the

154
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,560
reasons here and it's kind of good for a

155
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,919
way in a way because probably three

156
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,140
years ago the major driver for going to

157
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,940
the cloud was saving money reducing

158
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,340
complexity and so you'd expect that to

159
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,530
be the number one answer but in fact

160
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,550
what is the most important very

161
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,430
important or important reason for going

162
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,759
to the cloud is improved secure

163
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,129
and/or the ability to meet compliance

164
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:42,009
regulations so that's now bubbled up to

165
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,249
the top as the most important driver for

166
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,400
organizations moving to the cloud so you

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,779
know this is a slide you can show to

168
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,569
your management you know if they're

169
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,949
saying well is anybody really going to

170
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,539
the car do people really trust the cloud

171
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,449
this says a lot about how far the cloud

172
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,330
has come from a trust point of view from

173
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,729
where it started just a few years ago so

174
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,610
a very important statistic here

175
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,120
from over 400 organizations that were

176
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,309
pulled in this particular survey so you

177
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,749
know you get the question what is the

178
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,059
cloud you know most of you go yeah I

179
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:20,620
know what the cloud is you don't need to

180
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,270
talk about that don't waste my time well

181
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,680
I won't spend a whole lot of time on

182
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,169
these slides but I think it's worth

183
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,059
having the conversation just to make

184
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,680
sure we're all using the same language

185
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
when we think about the cloud and

186
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,339
hopefully you can take some of these

187
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,719
slides if you need them when you're

188
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,059
educating your own staff or if you're

189
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,649
making presentations to your management

190
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,870
if they say well what the heck is the

191
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,490
cloud maybe some of these slides can be

192
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,139
useful so I'm gonna start with the

193
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,209
standard NIST definition this was

194
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,610
definition this put a several years ago

195
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,529
and it's actually held up pretty well

196
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,979
and what you know I'll give you a chance

197
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,719
to read it but what I've done here is

198
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,909
underline some of the most important

199
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,339
aspects of cloud that really are not

200
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:06,129
just the the technical attributes but

201
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,870
they're also the key benefits of why

202
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,059
people go to the cloud the idea of

203
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,969
ubiquitous convenient on-demand network

204
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,830
access to whatever service that you're

205
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,020
signing up for whether it's a payroll

206
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,819
service whether it's charging a credit

207
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,649
card whether it's getting access to your

208
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,870
files or email it's something that you

209
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,479
can get whenever you need it and this

210
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,180
idea of a pool of configurable computing

211
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,969
resources that can expand and contract

212
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,130
as you need them so you only pay for

213
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,469
what you need regardless of whether it's

214
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,990
network bandwidth servers server compute

215
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,899
time storage and that sort of thing can

216
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,880
be rapidly provision this is a key

217
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,630
differentiator between other types of

218
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,640
on-premises computing the idea that okay

219
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,300
I need to spin up a virtual

220
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,510
to do a particular job you can do that

221
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,970
literally within minutes use that

222
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,950
virtual machine for whatever purpose you

223
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,960
need and then turn it off only pay for

224
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,750
the compute time you need and you can do

225
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,140
that with minimal effort so this is one

226
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,910
of the biggest attractions I think for

227
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,430
smaller businesses and less IT oriented

228
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,380
businesses is they don't have to be

229
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,970
computer scientists to be able to use

230
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,920
the cloud there are cloud models that

231
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,140
consists of five essential

232
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,460
characteristics and we'll go through

233
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,170
these three service models and for

234
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,970
deployment models this was back in the

235
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,180
old NIST definition most people would

236
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,890
say hey we've gone away beyond that

237
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,390
there are a lot more models but this is

238
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,030
a good place to start because literally

239
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,550
when you start thinking about as a

240
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,100
service models it you know there are new

241
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,030
ones appearing every single day so the

242
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,010
essential cloud characteristics and

243
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,540
again these are some of the biggest

244
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,060
benefits the idea of on-demand

245
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,130
self-service broad network access so you

246
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,720
can be anywhere in the world and be able

247
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,700
to get access assuming that you have

248
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,430
internet access to your services the

249
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,890
idea of resource pooling and be able to

250
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,820
share resources rapid elasticity the

251
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,980
idea of being able to rapidly expand

252
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,140
somebody like the IRS when it comes to

253
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,880
tax time they need a lot of compute

254
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,250
power well they can expand to whatever

255
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,780
size they need virtually infinite

256
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,120
compute power and then contract back

257
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,580
down when the tax season is done and

258
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,460
then the idea of a measured service the

259
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,680
idea that you can only you only have to

260
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,020
pay for what you use and rather than

261
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,790
having to invest in a lot of compute

262
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,950
resources you basically just pay for the

263
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,350
the compute time that you use that's

264
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,370
owned by the cloud service provider so

265
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,910
service models again the service models

266
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,040
is kind of almost becoming an infinite

267
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,620
list but the three big ones are software

268
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,050
is a service so when you think about

269
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,600
software as a service things like office

270
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,630
365 you know the ability to deliver

271
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,630
software as a service from the cloud and

272
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,400
it's not just email could be you know

273
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,880
your word

274
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,390
or excel session is delivered as a cloud

275
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,630
session Google Apps another big example

276
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,760
of software as a service and Salesforce

277
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,070
of course one of the early pioneers that

278
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,370
the idea of being able to deliver a very

279
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,350
robust enterprise application without

280
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,910
the need for any software being

281
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,580
installed on your on your computer we

282
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,430
also have things that are appearing you

283
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,670
know things like email as a service but

284
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,530
really is is part of the idea of

285
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,650
software as a service we have platform

286
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,660
as a service this is the idea of course

287
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,140
of using the cloud as essentially a

288
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,130
computer you can program that thing and

289
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,840
basically write applications that make

290
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,460
use of the resources that are in the

291
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,850
cloud and so we have Microsoft Azure of

292
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,760
course as well as Google App Engine and

293
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,950
in other models out there for being able

294
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,500
to program and write applications to the

295
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,140
cloud and then the other big one is

296
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,120
infrastructure as a service

297
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,300
you know folks like Amazon Microsoft

298
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,890
even Dropbox when you think about the

299
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,660
idea of infrastructure being even a

300
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,870
virtual hard drive these are folks that

301
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,330
are offering virtual computers that you

302
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,040
can ramp up quickly in the form of

303
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,380
virtual machines for example and be able

304
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,180
to do whatever computing you need there

305
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,330
and then we have other as a service

306
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,830
offering it's coming along things like

307
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,690
identity as a service so rather than

308
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,950
having to maintain your own

309
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,930
for instance Active Directory servers

310
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,390
on-premises you can actually do that as

311
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,210
a as a cloud service and we'll walk

312
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,620
through some examples of some of these

313
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,790
in a sec we have four main deployment

314
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,560
models we have public cloud private

315
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,980
cloud community cloud and hybrid cloud

316
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,110
public cloud initially started out as

317
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,580
something that people stayed away from

318
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,430
they thought gee you know like Gmail I I

319
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,050
don't really want to use the same of

320
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,940
this infrastructure Google uses for

321
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,640
Gmail for my business applications well

322
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,200
a lot has happened in the last couple of

323
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,840
years and people are beginning to really

324
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,910
trust the public cloud and that's where

325
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,650
you're gonna get the biggest economic

326
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,810
benefits as well as the biggest benefits

327
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,660
for reducing complexity but we also have

328
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,970
the option for private cloud the idea of

329
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,840
taking everything that's in

330
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,630
public cloud putting it in a box and

331
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,820
then being able to install that on your

332
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,760
own servers and storage systems and

333
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,550
whatever in your own data center a good

334
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,680
example of that is the the azure stack

335
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,320
and basically what Microsoft's done is

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,839
taken all of the software that they use

337
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,940
to run their public cloud and make that

338
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,070
available to organizations to be able to

339
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,350
install in their own datacenter and be

340
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,970
able to use that for for running

341
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,790
essentially their own private version of

342
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,440
the public cloud behind their own

343
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,950
firewall and again you know we'll look

344
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,570
at what the difference is between that

345
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,850
and just standard on-premises computing

346
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,310
but again always keep those

347
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,779
characteristics in mind in order to

348
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,240
really think about it as a cloud we have

349
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,850
community cloud that's where a cluster

350
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,640
of different folks who have similar

351
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,100
interests or certain security concerns

352
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,620
of privacy concerns and get together and

353
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,560
have their own community cloud the best

354
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,120
example here would be the government

355
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,730
cloud here in the US many of the cloud

356
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,250
vendors have data centers specifically

357
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,650
focused for government customers and

358
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,020
that's what they sign up to and so

359
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,690
they're using a cloud data center system

360
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,910
that's totally isolated from the public

361
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,030
cloud where other businesses or or even

362
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,220
individuals could be using the services

363
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,650
and then hybrid is essentially a mix of

364
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,800
of any of the previous three where you

365
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,690
may be doing public cloud for some stuff

366
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,089
private cloud for other and having them

367
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,560
talk together and work together and of

368
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,540
course we also have the possibility of

369
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,030
cloud working with our own premises

370
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,770
systems and I'll talk about that a

371
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,810
little bit the idea that you may want to

372
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,610
keep some of your systems on-premises

373
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,830
for whatever reason and they're not

374
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,010
traditional cloud services their

375
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,440
traditional on-premises may be

376
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,330
client-server computing and one of the

377
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,310
biggest reasons there is maybe you

378
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,839
already have all the systems it's

379
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,350
working it's all paid off great

380
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,680
you know response time when people are

381
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,330
using the service so you don't want to

382
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,130
rip that all out but you may want to use

383
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,750
services there for instance maybe

384
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,120
billing that's a cloud service and so

385
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,910
you can tie those together use the cloud

386
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,170
where it makes sense and be able to

387
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,490
still leverage your investments

388
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,750
on-premises so the other thing to look

389
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,190
at is what is not a cloud these are

390
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,130
different technologies here that it can

391
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,320
exist both on-premises and in the cloud

392
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,810
but aren't necessarily cloud computing

393
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,850
things like outsourced tightiy or remote

394
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,700
data centers this just could be you've

395
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,010
hired IBM to basically run your data

396
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,690
center for you well it's not necessarily

397
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,460
cloud computing it's just basically

398
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,910
on-premises but in a different place

399
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,320
virtual machines again if you're

400
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,000
manually setting up your own virtual

401
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,850
machines and doing the software images

402
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,570
and everything else

403
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,210
it's hard work that's not you don't get

404
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,370
the benefits of what you get from sort

405
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,230
of the auto provision capabilities from

406
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,779
most of the cloud vendors and on and on

407
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,190
so there's there's a variety of

408
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,410
different classes of types of apps and

409
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,290
services that you may be using today and

410
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,670
you think oh that's cloud I've got an

411
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,070
internet based email must be cloud well

412
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,630
not necessarily if you're the person

413
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,500
who's having to administer that system

414
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,080
so the the big differentiator again when

415
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,700
you're thinking about cloud are you know

416
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,950
on-demand self-service broad network

417
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,010
access resource pooling rapid elasticity

418
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,170
and measured service so those are the

419
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,970
key things that you should think about

420
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,350
when you're looking at these and

421
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,670
thinking okay if I got all these

422
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,070
characteristics in my internet based

423
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,240
email for example so I wanted to walk

424
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,490
through a couple of examples just make

425
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,959
sure everybody's sort of on the same

426
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,150
page with these here's an example of a

427
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,540
multi-tenant public cloud so you could

428
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,679
think of Google Apps or office 365 so in

429
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,079
this case we we might have three

430
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,760
different types of cloud services

431
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,309
software as a service platform as a

432
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,290
service and infrastructure as a service

433
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,929
and these are all hosted in the same

434
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,569
cloud infrastructure where multiple

435
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,209
customers say worker one from company a

436
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,270
and we have worker one from Company B

437
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,120
are both writing applications using the

438
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,790
platform services of the cloud but

439
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,040
they're completely isolated from each

440
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,810
other so they don't actually know that

441
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,290
there's an

442
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,560
their company using those same services

443
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,090
we could also have for instance multiple

444
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,870
folks using the same email system hosted

445
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,610
in the cloud but one might be in Europe

446
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,760
and why one might be in Asia but they're

447
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,080
using the same service that's

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,790
distributed throughout the cloud and

449
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,100
then possibly a third customer that's

450
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,800
over here running infrastructures of

451
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
service may be spinning up some virtual

452
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,090
machines for various tasks so that's

453
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,910
your typical multi-tenant public cloud

454
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,630
if you look at a typical private cloud

455
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,600
it looks an awful lot the same the big

456
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,910
difference here is that all of this is

457
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,270
built behind your corporate firewall

458
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,490
typically and all of the people that are

459
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,280
using this are your employees or people

460
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,890
who work in your organization so you're

461
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,560
not doing any sharing all of this is

462
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,840
happening within your own organization

463
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,180
but you still get the benefits of the

464
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,130
cloud you can spin up resources move

465
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,040
them around Auto provision virtual

466
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,620
machines that sort of thing and and use

467
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,390
the cloud just like you could in the

468
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,370
public cloud but do it behind your own

469
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,310
firewall so the other big question you

470
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,290
guys well how does cloud really differ

471
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,170
from on-premises computing so this is

472
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,000
just a very simple example of

473
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,160
on-premises we've got our corporate

474
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,880
headquarters here we have data center

475
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,350
inside the organization where we might

476
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,040
have some file sharing systems we might

477
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,320
have some email systems and then we have

478
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,060
users inside the main office on

479
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,760
terminals and laptops and whatever

480
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,350
accessing these systems but we also

481
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,470
offer the ability for our remote offices

482
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,930
mobile users and home users to be able

483
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,990
to VPN or directly connect to our

484
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,130
services on-premises so this typically

485
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,560
involves a capex funding so this means

486
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,800
you are buying lots of servers and

487
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,660
software you're installing it in a data

488
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,670
center maybe you're renting the space at

489
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,010
the day's center but this is a fairly

490
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,060
large outlay of capital the compute

491
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,340
resources you usually manage by you or

492
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,900
they're managed by somebody that you've

493
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,049
hired but you're responsible

494
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,850
all of the management of those systems

495
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,399
and you retain full control over all the

496
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,039
apps in the data so that's kind of you

497
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,440
know we're we're we historically had

498
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,739
been for the last couple of decades if

499
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:06,619
we look at cloud computing what we have

500
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,830
here is that the cloud service provider

501
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,789
has basically provided the cloud servers

502
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,320
and infrastructure that you need to

503
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,350
carry on your business and expose the

504
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,029
compute power and storage power

505
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,730
networking power through the the various

506
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,609
cloud service models and then all of

507
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:27,529
your offices including your headquarters

508
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,359
your mobile users home our users

509
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,879
whatever connect to these services over

510
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:35,210
the internet using a trusted connection

511
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,779
of some type and again in this case

512
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,419
we're using more of an OP X model where

513
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,249
you're renting the service you're paying

514
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:46,039
per month and it's not just a flat fee

515
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,989
per month but paying for the cycles that

516
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:50,239
you're actually consuming and so for a

517
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,100
lot of organizations this is hugely

518
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,200
attractive because it's much easier to

519
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,730
manage budgets this way rather than

520
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,889
trying to amortize the purchase of

521
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,749
computers and that sort of thing over

522
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:04,119
many years and also in this case these

523
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,590
servers here are managed by the cloud

524
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,259
service provider you don't even care how

525
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,820
many servers are there or what type of

526
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,679
storage they use because it's all

527
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,899
exposed to you simply as a service and

528
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,820
then the control and access to the data

529
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,769
even though it's being run by this

530
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:23,509
organization over here

531
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,109
all of the big vendors are super focused

532
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,700
on making sure that there's no

533
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,580
compromise on privacy or security and so

534
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,080
if anything this model will be more

535
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,539
private more secure than typically what

536
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,669
you can you can do on your own and if

537
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,200
you look at a lot of the big breaches

538
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,029
that have happened many of them have

539
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,149
happened from companies that had this

540
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,629
model the old on-premises compute model

541
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:52,879
not so much in the cloud compute model

542
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,289
where people who have been dealing with

543
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,320
the great big vendors they typically are

544
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,690
much more secure or private than they

545
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,160
were

546
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,810
when they were doing it themselves going

547
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,880
to sort of a level deeper and looking at

548
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,700
email as an example looking at

549
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,510
on-premises versus cloud so you know

550
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,070
historically if you had something like

551
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,810
an exchange server and email server it

552
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,930
might be a linux server whatever

553
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,610
on-premises you would install that

554
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,020
software on a server here and your users

555
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,600
would maybe authenticate with some sort

556
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,820
of identity management system in this

557
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,560
case we're talking about exchange so the

558
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,780
active directory that authenticate and

559
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,720
then access the services directly on the

560
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,840
server that's managed inside the the

561
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,900
corporate data center that's owned by

562
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,120
the the organization and then the email

563
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,150
gets fired off to the the Internet this

564
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,040
way and and this connection to the

565
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,990
Internet is managed by the organization

566
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,370
as well so in the cloud based Exchange

567
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,910
Online model it might look more complex

568
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,950
but it's actually more straightforward

569
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,860
in that all of this part here is all

570
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,860
managed by Microsoft including the

571
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,360
connection to the Internet secure

572
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,340
connection with the Internet managing

573
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,940
the exchange servers and then as well

574
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,210
handling the authentication of users and

575
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,560
so users simply connect to the service

576
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,780
they may authenticate locally or they

577
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,150
may authenticate through a cloud-based

578
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,770
authentication system which is

579
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
synchronized but basically they just

580
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,000
connect to the service do their email

581
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,470
and then that gets fired out to the

582
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,920
internet that way so the the overhead of

583
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,890
managing these two models very very

584
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,200
little overhead here a lot of overhead

585
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,520
here of trying to manage your own

586
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,390
exchange servers so just a fairly

587
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,410
simplistic example one to spend just a

588
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,030
couple of minutes and talk about where

589
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,700
is the cloud you know we get this

590
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,110
question a lot and so if you think about

591
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,360
where the what cloud data centers used

592
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,820
to look like they look just like regular

593
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,330
old data centers they were data and

594
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,120
racks of computers and storage lots of

595
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,690
network

596
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,059
Abel's here and they seem to go on you

597
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,740
know forever and if you wanted to add

598
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,330
more compute power he brought in some

599
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,129
more servers you put them in the rack

600
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,320
brought in some more storage put it in

601
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,750
the rack did all the cabling and it was

602
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,940
a lot of overhead for the cloud

603
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,100
providers and to be honest a lot of them

604
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,480
didn't make a lot of money doing this

605
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,029
but now we've actually moved to a new

606
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:37,200
model for a lot of the modern providers

607
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,519
there's a picture of one of Microsoft's

608
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,159
data centers and what we have here is

609
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,769
these modules right here is an example

610
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:48,059
of one that basically can be dropped

611
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,559
anywhere in the world as a single

612
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,730
compute unit for cloud computing and you

613
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,740
literally plug it into the power you

614
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,080
take a garden hose and plug it into the

615
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,629
water to get water cooling and then plug

616
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:04,000
it in to the network and they they can

617
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,809
be configured automatically to basically

618
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,909
join the cloud and offer their services

619
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:13,990
up so a lot less overhead for the people

620
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,909
who are managing these data centers and

621
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:18,370
then also a lot more flexibility if

622
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,320
you're operating in a data center you

623
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,120
have a way too much capacity and

624
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,679
nobody's ever going to use it you can

625
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,919
pick one of these up put it on a freight

626
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:28,570
train and move it to the other data

627
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,389
center where maybe you did need it so a

628
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,549
lot of innovation going on behind the

629
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:36,039
scenes I tried to get a tour of the mic

630
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,840
one of the Microsoft cloud data centers

631
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,299
but they wouldn't let me in but but you

632
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,360
can go online and just type in a search

633
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,759
for Microsoft virtual data center tour

634
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,120
and they have a very cool

635
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,679
interactive data center tour that you

636
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,009
can go through and see you know kind of

637
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,509
some of these new innovations that are

638
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:59,980
going on so this is a picture of of

639
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,320
Microsoft's global data centers Amazon

640
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,149
would have a very similar picture Google

641
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,840
others but as you can see you know we've

642
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,309
come a long way in the last couple of

643
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,169
years from just a couple of data centers

644
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,960
to data centers all over the world and

645
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,899
more coming online all the time the

646
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:18,429
green ones are new ones that are coming

647
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,840
on in Canada some new ones in Europe and

648
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,940
and it's not just adding new data

649
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,260
centers as Brendan mentioned

650
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,180
is kind of a new model that's being

651
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,630
tested out the idea of using trustees to

652
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,790
manage the data center so that Microsoft

653
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,560
can take themselves out of that the

654
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,180
chain I feel like if there's a warrant

655
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,980
that comes down says you know we want

656
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,170
the data in that data centers is not our

657
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,480
data center well we own it but we don't

658
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,850
run it and we don't have a way to get

659
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,030
access to that data you need to contact

660
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,890
the local law enforcement authorities

661
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,960
and have them submit a subpoena to the

662
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,240
people who operate it in a lawful way in

663
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,730
that country so a very creative way to

664
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,580
sort of help protect customer data even

665
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,070
more than they have been doing in the

666
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,550
past so you know a lot of expansion

667
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,620
going on to really meet customer demand

668
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,940
so I wanted to spend a few minutes and

669
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,180
talk about compliance in the cloud I am

670
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,120
NOT the compliance expert Greg is over

671
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,820
there and he'll be talking in in gory

672
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,530
detail on some of the compliance

673
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,510
challenges but I wanted to give you a

674
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,600
little overview and really just kind of

675
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,550
emphasize this whole idea that trying to

676
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,860
manage compliance especially if you're a

677
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,200
multinational organization is really

678
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,590
really hard to do on your own you know

679
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,030
it's not just that there are a whole lot

680
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,590
of standards out there but they're

681
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,290
constantly changing and and you guys

682
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,880
know better than just about anybody in

683
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,800
the world you know what happened in

684
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,070
Europe you know with safe harbor going

685
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,290
away and then you know I guess we use

686
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,450
model clauses now and then you know now

687
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,550
we have privacy shield well if you're an

688
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,680
individual organization trying to

689
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,990
navigate through all of those challenges

690
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,750
it can be hugely complicated and

691
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,300
time-consuming and consume a lot of your

692
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,450
resources so you really want to make

693
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,920
sure that you know when you're going to

694
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,780
the cloud go with somebody who can help

695
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,060
offload a lot of that complexity and do

696
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,700
that work for you and you know we

697
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,620
actually you know we use the term the

698
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,930
idea of a compliance decision maker you

699
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,340
know we've got your business decision

700
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,620
maker and technical decision maker but a

701
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,720
compliance business decision maker who's

702
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,270
in the the chain of approval for new

703
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,170
technology and they go I just I'm

704
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,120
overwhelmed I can't believe that you

705
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,380
know this cloud provider is going to

706
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,360
look after our ability to meet this

707
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,580
halation to do our business and you know

708
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,220
china or whether it's going to be in new

709
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,190
zealand or wherever and so you know

710
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,450
they'll say look you know we got a

711
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,549
slowdown we can't jump to the cloud we

712
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,500
already kind of haven't sort of sort of

713
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,710
figured out but and so we we see a lot

714
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,650
of people who are trying to nix the idea

715
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,929
of going to the cloud in fact one

716
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:06,049
example if I can just use this for a

717
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,220
second

718
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,679
there was a law firm here in the States

719
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,600
and they were looking to go to the cloud

720
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,780
and their own legal counsel said now you

721
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,429
can't do that because if you put you

722
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:18,020
know client data up in the cloud you're

723
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,850
gonna violate attorney-client privilege

724
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,340
and you know they passed that

725
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,559
information back and this was you know a

726
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,270
Microsoft salesperson who was trying to

727
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,990
sell Microsoft cloud services and you

728
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,790
know they came back and said hey can you

729
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,429
guys help us at all well so we actually

730
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:36,350
did some research on this we got some

731
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,059
really smart people people like dan

732
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,059
Soloff to go and dive down into the

733
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,880
issue and and really find out the answer

734
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,010
it will you lose attorney-client

735
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,440
privilege if you store you know

736
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,330
sensitive client data up in the cloud

737
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,929
and and the in fact there's been lots of

738
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,700
rulings on this already and the American

739
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,740
Bar Association has said no if you if

740
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,809
you follow you know very strict rules

741
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:02,030
about how you treat the data and who has

742
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,059
access to it you can use the cloud for

743
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,190
storing client data without violating

744
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,890
the attorney-client privilege so that's

745
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,750
kind of an example of you know trying to

746
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,309
grapple with some of these challenges

747
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,350
and overcome some of the misperceptions

748
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,669
that are out there related to cloud

749
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:21,070
computing so we sort of think of

750
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,419
compliance with standards and the cloud

751
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:26,660
and three big buckets and and again I'm

752
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,390
not a compliance expert but it certainly

753
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,880
makes it easier for me to understand but

754
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,580
the idea of broad cross industry

755
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,100
international standards that are out

756
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,140
there that everybody should care about

757
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,260
and that every cloud provider frankly

758
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,110
should be providing support for and a

759
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,669
lot of these aren't just sort of

760
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,799
checklist items if you if you focus in

761
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,850
on one here the 2700 18 ISO

762
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,169
you know this was really brought about

763
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,080
by people really concerned about what is

764
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
going on with my data when I hand it

765
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,100
over to a cloud provider I want to have

766
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,410
an assurance that that data's not being

767
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,929
used for advertising or marketing or

768
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:11,210
shared with other customers or whatever

769
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,330
I want not just an assurance I want a

770
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,580
standard that I can see okay that

771
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,110
provider complies with the standard

772
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,150
therefore I know there's kind of a code

773
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,429
of practice in place that will protect

774
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:24,860
my data when it gets used by the

775
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,220
provider of the services but not used by

776
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,380
anybody else and essentially it's it's

777
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,450
protecting the data only for the use

778
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,390
that you intended it for so there's a

779
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,860
lot of different standards out there

780
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,260
there really are international standards

781
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,570
impact everybody and then we kind of

782
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,270
have two other groups we have you know

783
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,440
vertical standards and regulations that

784
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,630
impact different industries healthcare

785
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,240
manufacturing education financial

786
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,400
services government law enforcement

787
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,260
we'll hear a little more about some of

788
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,909
the challenges with law enforcement a

789
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:01,940
little later on from Jenner

790
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,950
each of these industries have their own

791
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,929
specific standards and we have to be

792
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,429
able to comply with these in order to

793
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:09,440
play in the industry if you want to

794
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,390
offer education services you've got to

795
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,350
comply with FERPA

796
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,650
and that sort of thing so you know we've

797
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,720
got all of these to worry about again a

798
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,309
big task if you're trying to do this on

799
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:19,700
your own

800
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,159
and then we have regional standards and

801
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,350
so if you're a multinational company or

802
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,780
organization you not only have to worry

803
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,220
about you know complying with

804
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,799
regulations here in the US but you know

805
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,210
of course Europe has lots of issues but

806
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,159
so the lots of other countries and more

807
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:38,870
and more countries are jumping onboard

808
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,570
with establishing their own standards

809
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,490
and regulations and you got to keep pace

810
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,860
with all of those as they come on stream

811
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,390
if you want to do business in those

812
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,390
countries and in some cases we have a

813
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,789
mix of both the you know the vertical

814
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:56,210
and the international for instance in in

815
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,360
the UK you have Gulf Cloud which is sort

816
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,770
of a set of requirements for dealing

817
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,080
with you know offering cloud services to

818
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,200
the UK government so you know it's a

819
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,080
fairly complicated

820
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,360
set of standards that may it may or may

821
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,310
not apply to your business and again

822
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,020
going with a cloud provider who's kind

823
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,760
of figured this all out

824
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,130
is hugely important if you really want

825
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,480
to take advantage of the cloud so you

826
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,490
know basically what a compliant cloud

827
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,720
offers you know I I was talking to some

828
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,790
folks who talked to people like

829
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,130
yourselves a lot and the one thing that

830
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,840
kept bubbling up was the idea of risk

831
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,780
you know how can I manage risk how can I

832
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,600
transfer risk and so if you can feel

833
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,430
comfortable transferring some of your

834
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,220
compliance risk to a cloud provider that

835
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,240
will help you you know sleep at night we

836
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,640
also of course have to make sure that

837
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,820
respecting rules that are imposed on us

838
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,500
to it participate in certain types of

839
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,150
industries even something as simple as

840
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,680
taking a credit card

841
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,980
obviously PCI rules coming in into play

842
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,780
and you need to keep that information

843
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,239
confidential in a way that complies with

844
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,239
the the regulations so the whole idea

845
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,159
here is to sort of lower your risk

846
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,100
profile and offload a lot of that

847
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,980
compliance work over to a cloud service

848
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,690
provider I wanted to just take a second

849
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,239
you know what a compliant cloud looks

850
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,739
like in real time so this is just a I

851
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,949
have an office 365 and Azure account

852
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,840
myself from my own little business and

853
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,360
one of the new things that that have

854
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,239
been added for an office 365 customer is

855
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,790
the ability to go into a security and

856
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,360
compliance portal that you manage and so

857
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,830
this is very cool you can go through all

858
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,400
the various attributes here we have

859
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,070
alerts permission security policies data

860
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,700
management certs an investigation so

861
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,580
this one for example permissions and and

862
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,050
this is one thing to really keep in mind

863
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,210
is is that compliance in the cloud is a

864
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,860
shared responsibility

865
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,870
you know Microsoft provides this tool

866
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,760
Anna's on will have their tools Google

867
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,530
will have their tools but it's up to you

868
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,150
to actually use these tools and use them

869
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,600
appropriately so for example you know

870
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,930
for compliance administrator I can set

871
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,810
up a roll

872
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,030
based identity for your compliance

873
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,890
administrators and joining people to

874
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,100
that role based on their need to be able

875
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,670
to be involved in the compliance of your

876
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,170
organization and some of the things that

877
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,630
these you know that person would have

878
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,550
control over or the group of people

879
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:44,880
would be you know the ability to you

880
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
know manage that manage the other

881
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,120
members within it do data loss

882
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,970
prevention reports that sort of thing

883
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,610
retention policies and all that sort of

884
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,800
stuff so in this case we have a bunch of

885
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,420
different roles a little hard to read

886
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,960
I'm kind of squinting but that you can

887
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,570
assign to help manage the compliance of

888
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,140
your organization another page that

889
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,210
comes up here for example is if I want

890
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,700
to you know let's say my boss came in

891
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,380
and says can you actually prove that

892
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,600
we're PCI compliant can you give me

893
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,430
something that'll actually I can take

894
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,960
and show to the board to show them that

895
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,970
we're doing this the right way so we

896
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,550
have a resource area as part of your

897
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,580
customer service here that's based on

898
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,200
your business you actually answer a

899
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,670
couple of questions about the type of

900
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,750
business that you're in

901
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,300
and then it offers the whole list of the

902
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,070
various reports that you can go and grab

903
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,020
and print out and hand to your

904
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,090
management to show them yes we do comply

905
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,390
so that's kind of what the new world of

906
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,160
compliance looks like in the cloud

907
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,510
a lot of this works already been done

908
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,220
for you you don't have to go out and

909
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,290
start scrambling and worrying about a

910
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,970
lot of these standards and doing it

911
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,430
yourself

912
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,950
so just a couple of things I wanted to

913
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,960
you know talk about at the end here is

914
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,620
is the idea that you know regardless of

915
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,240
the type of architecture that you want

916
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,190
to use you should be able to have choice

917
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,350
with your cloud vendor be able to do

918
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,450
private cloud public cloud or maybe a

919
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,820
mix of both it was kind of interesting

920
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,370
with private cloud there was a an

921
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,870
article that was published a couple of

922
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,190
months ago in infoworld

923
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,350
David

924
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,960
I believe is how you pronounce his name

925
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,520
I think the title of it was something

926
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,220
like you know Microsoft Azure for

927
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,470
private cloud is dead on arrival or

928
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,980
something and a lot of the points he

929
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,510
made didn't really make a lot of sense

930
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,190
but what was really fascinating and

931
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,860
there's all these people like yourselves

932
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,200
piling on with comments saying no we

933
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,030
actually like this idea we like the

934
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,320
option to be able to build our own

935
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,780
private cloud if we really feel like we

936
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,310
absolutely have to we won't necessarily

937
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,980
use it but the idea that that's there is

938
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,770
really super comforting to know that we

939
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,900
could build our own private cloud in our

940
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,730
own existing data center if we felt like

941
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,200
we really had to for a particularly

942
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,240
sensitive type of workload so you know

943
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,160
if you have super super sensitive data

944
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,800
or applications the option to build your

945
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,510
own private cloud and still have the

946
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,680
cloud benefits is always there a lot of

947
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,330
people go with public cloud because

948
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,890
that's where you get the maximum

949
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,650
economic benefit and the least amount of

950
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,290
complexity and you know people

951
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,300
originally were kind of you know I'm not

952
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,220
sure about public clouds you know who's

953
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,620
gonna get access to that data will be

954
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,510
used for something else well people are

955
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,100
feeling more and more comfortable as the

956
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,620
survey results showed about the idea of

957
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,620
using public cloud and if you look at a

958
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,210
lot of the reports that are coming out

959
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,280
now public cloud is really just

960
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,790
exploding in use much more so than just

961
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,590
about any other type of cloud

962
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,810
architecture but you also have the

963
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,670
option here that you could do a hybrid

964
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,950
cloud a bit of mix of both where you

965
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,200
have maybe some services in a workload

966
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,540
running in private and some working in

967
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,640
public and maybe even some working on

968
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,240
on-premises and and so you know one

969
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,310
thing to really look for is is the idea

970
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,020
of you know whichever one you choose you

971
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,200
should have a consistent platform across

972
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,690
all of these different architectures and

973
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,400
the same type of tools and the same type

974
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,560
of management concepts and be able to do

975
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,410
it in a way that's you know much much

976
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,910
simpler than it would have been if you

977
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,890
were setting up your own data centers

978
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:30,270
for these types of workloads so that's

979
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,610
what I had to say I'm happy to take any

980
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,930
questions or

981
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,910
and we have lots of other experts here

982
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,320
who can answer questions that I probably

983
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:55,170
can't answer but yeah okay my name is

984
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,940
Rudi Gudde I'm with Intel security I

985
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,820
didn't question about vendor

986
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,770
responsibility for meeting compliance

987
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,260
standards he said that the customer has

988
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,230
to use the tools properly but how much

989
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,540
responsibility will the vendors take on

990
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,450
for keeping their tools compliant for

991
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,160
example if they built something that was

992
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,030
a up/down and regulation changed it had

993
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,860
to be opted in in a certain region and

994
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,630
they failed to do that would they take

995
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,340
on responsibilities were they gonna

996
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,840
disclaim that kind of thing

997
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,390
how's that that's a standard now why I

998
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,340
can't answer on behalf of any of the

999
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,050
vendors but I think one of the things

1000
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,780
that they do is worry about that you

1001
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,430
know day in and day out if you look at

1002
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,620
Microsoft for example there's a thousand

1003
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,570
lawyers and policy makers in there that

1004
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,520
are looking at this coupled with

1005
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,290
engineers who are trying to figure out

1006
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,030
how to implement a particular type of

1007
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,060
new policy a good example is what

1008
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,410
happened with in Europe you know from my

1009
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,780
understanding you know the folks inside

1010
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,740
Microsoft could see that you know the

1011
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,530
safe harbor system was in trouble and it

1012
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,270
was only a matter of days and literally

1013
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,280
a couple of years before it fell apart

1014
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,320
has started working through the idea of

1015
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,380
PU model clauses and literally went to

1016
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,360
every single jurisdiction and got those

1017
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,910
in place so that if safe-harbor went

1018
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,310
away you know there would still be a

1019
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,260
model for being able to have their

1020
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,290
customers carry on business in fact safe

1021
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,330
harbor went away and you know

1022
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,040
fortunately there was that safety net

1023
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,530
there that allowed customers to carry on

1024
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,380
with their business then you know

1025
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,190
obviously Microsoft Amazon Google IBM

1026
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,710
all of the major vendors were very

1027
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,910
interested to see what was going to

1028
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,800
happen with privacy shield we're deeply

1029
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,020
involved and of course you know people

1030
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,030
like Microsoft were first in line to

1031
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,870
sign

1032
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,940
for privacy shield in order to be able

1033
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,800
to track those changes and make sure

1034
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,390
that they're in place for customers so

1035
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,390
that's one example but you know I think

1036
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,610
if you don't have that level of trust

1037
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,320
you're not going to have the customers

1038
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,480
and so if you start ignoring standards

1039
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,880
and ignoring compliance customers will

1040
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,050
go elsewhere there's a lot of

1041
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,180
competition in the space right now and a

1042
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,150
lot of good companies thank you for that

1043
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,760
definition of private cloud because I

1044
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,980
never understood it until you explained

1045
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,780
that it was basically the infrastructure

1046
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,740
of the cloud copied into a private

1047
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,480
server set earth or something where

1048
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,540
there's more of a boundary I suppose my

1049
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,700
question is other than the private cloud

1050
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,410
with it I'm looking and I'm looking this

1051
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,330
from from a federal government

1052
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,490
perspective and also someone has it has

1053
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,930
a security background IT security

1054
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,330
background one of the most important

1055
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:47,070
parts of getting a certified operation

1056
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,740
operation to operate is that you have to

1057
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,500
have a boundary of the system and you

1058
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,110
say this is this is ours this is theirs

1059
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,600
this is what I'm responsible for this

1060
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,180
and I just don't see how you can do that

1061
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,130
in the cloud when server could be

1062
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,910
anywhere in the world

1063
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,330
so in in that particular example you

1064
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,250
know one way to do it you know certainly

1065
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,350
what what Microsoft had done in Amazon

1066
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,390
have also done is build a community

1067
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,000
cloud that is built specifically for

1068
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,780
those requirements of that customer set

1069
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,870
a good example is is one that we were

1070
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,390
quite involved in and CJIs the criminal

1071
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,720
justice information system standards and

1072
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,610
gener going to talk about that but the

1073
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,060
the idea of you know law enforcement

1074
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,710
organizations have very strict rules and

1075
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,110
how you know data can be accessed who

1076
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,670
can have access to the de down to the

1077
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,680
point of whoever's administering the

1078
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,260
data center has to be checked as well

1079
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,860
and so you know private data centers for

1080
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,770
communities of law enforcement customers

1081
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,050
and that sort of thing it's sort of one

1082
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,030
way to go about it so that you can

1083
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,140
certify those people and the cysts

1084
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,539
in the physical security the software

1085
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,400
tools and whatever so that you can

1086
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,960
actually meet those standards and I know

1087
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,989
like the DISA requirements and other

1088
00:44:06,989 --> 00:44:08,999
requirements that are coming down

1089
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:11,619
Microsoft and Amazon are both been super

1090
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:13,599
active and you know trying to anticipate

1091
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,369
the standard and getting ahead of the

1092
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:18,220
game to get their systems at the maximum

1093
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,769
levels that are reasonable you know at

1094
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:22,420
some point you may hit you may hit a

1095
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,930
wall but organizations are you know

1096
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,430
constantly trying to push the boundaries

1097
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:37,809
of what's possible with cloud indirect

1098
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:40,779
and such as the the narrow question you

1099
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,999
just have to do it I mean in some level

1100
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:45,549
we have to work agency by agency to get

1101
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,489
FedRAMP certified with an own scope we

1102
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,369
have to layer 853 compliance or FedRAMP

1103
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,460
list compliance on with that agency now

1104
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,049
the nice thing about FedRAMP when it

1105
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,230
works is a lot of that evidence creation

1106
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,869
the next agency has a slightly easier

1107
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:05,259
time but we can get some general jag

1108
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:07,150
approval and things general oversight

1109
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,730
bidding yes you have to define what is

1110
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,460
the compliance though what are the set

1111
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,170
of controls that we're managing get the

1112
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,239
control evidence up layer it on to the

1113
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:18,549
agency and take it forward so in that

1114
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:23,099
specific case there's no way around it I

1115
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,599
just want to take one second if I could

1116
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,960
and just show you one of the the outputs

1117
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,599
of some of the work we've been doing

1118
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,180
which is providing some very focused

1119
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,109
resources for exactly this audience here

1120
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,940
we call it the legal and compliance

1121
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,309
community and you know one of the

1122
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,319
challenges we've heard from folks is you

1123
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,329
know it's just so much information I

1124
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,519
find it hard to find what I need I need

1125
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:51,640
to find out which standards apply to me

1126
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,200
in a particular industry and that sort

1127
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,630
of thing so we've built this new part of

1128
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,420
the Microsoft trust center for the legal

1129
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,880
and compliance community just to let you

1130
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,960
know and if you just do a search for

1131
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,210
Microsoft trust center it'll take you to

1132
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:04,660
this place

1133
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,589
but here we have an open letter from

1134
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:11,470
Brad Smith which you know he reaffirms

1135
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,810
the commitment to this community of

1136
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,849
helping resolve the issues that you have

1137
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:18,430
in challenges with with compliance and

1138
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:19,869
in fact I think you have printed copies

1139
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:22,630
of that letter in there we also have

1140
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,150
resources and certifications so you know

1141
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,490
for instance if you want to see what

1142
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,750
certifications are available for and I

1143
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,400
think we still have a live connection

1144
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,340
here

1145
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:41,170
No maybe done so I'd invite you when you

1146
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,760
have an internet connection go visit

1147
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,460
this and you know we have news and

1148
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,500
events so we actually track news as it

1149
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,020
happens during you know in the day

1150
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,250
publish that out to the site so if you

1151
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,990
want to see what's happening and you can

1152
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,330
do it filtered by different attributes

1153
