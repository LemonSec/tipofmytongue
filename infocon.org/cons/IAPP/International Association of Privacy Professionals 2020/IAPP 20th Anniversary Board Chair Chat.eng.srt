65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
but i'm super excited for the first

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
question that we want to ask which is

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,560
behind you but i also

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,920
i also want to know um you know 20 years

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,519
ago can you just tell us a little bit

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,319
about

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,800
how it all started and and uh

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
sure sure so sure so

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
20 years ago plus it for me it really

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
began with graham leach bliley um i was

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,159
in the financial services area

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,040
and a lot of people at that time became

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
privacy officers

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
and i heard of an organization called

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
the privacy

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,800
officers association and i thought oh i

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
should probably join this and get to

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
meet other people well the privacy

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,760
officer

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,879
association gathered i remember in a

90
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,440
small

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
conference room probably in march of

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
2000

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
and there were a few other people there

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
several that were now very much

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
involved with the iapp and we began

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
talking about privacy the governance

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,599
issues the

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
situations that were going to be in

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,959
requiring

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,519
of compliance program which riley in

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
2001

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,239
also around that time there was another

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
sort of competing

104
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,760
uh privacy organization and i always

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,360
have to look that one up because i was

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,159
not a member

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
of the association of corporate privacy

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,439
officers

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,280
you'll note that both of these

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
organizations have the title privacy

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,120
officers

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
after a while after meetings after the

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,599
meetings went from about

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,319
35 to maybe 75 people in total fast

115
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,439
forward till

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,720
about 2002 there were a lot of

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
discussions about bringing the two

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
organizations together why should they

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
compete with each other let's have

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
one and grow it and

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
create a board create a

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,919
organization that could govern it and i

123
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
was asked to become

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
the chair of it and i i love saying that

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,600
there have been

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
so many changes obviously with the now

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
iapp

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
the growth you talked about it justin at

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
the very beginning

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,639
but my number one happiness and my

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,759
number one

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,720
i think success was hiring trevor chris

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,080
you'll remember

134
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,720
those interviews those conversations in

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
the summer of 2002

136
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,360
where we interviewed for someone to lead

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
the iapp

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
um we had had a consulting organization

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
that did a lot of the behind the scenes

140
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,759
that really kind of led

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
us and we thought we're now this larger

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
organization we need an executive

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,600
director

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
so for me uh the best hire ever

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,880
after all of these years i would have to

146
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
say was trevor hughes

147
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,080
who now leads the iapp that's my initial

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
story

149
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,320
well done well you deserve a lot of

150
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
credit i think

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
and uh we're certainly grateful for that

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,479
foresight

153
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,919
i agree with sandy there so chris were

154
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,440
you part of the you were part of the

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,320

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
2000 long long time ago i remember it

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
was a cold

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
rainy kind of winter evening and we all

162
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,600
met in some

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,639

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,520
back then and and just to echo agnes

170
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400

and i think

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
vince as well interviewing candidates

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
for the executive director position

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
and uh we we could not have made a a

176
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,479
better choice than trevor hughes i've

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
always said that uh

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
much of uh much of where and what the

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,240
iep

180
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
is today is is in large part due to

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
trevor's leadership his foresight his

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
entrepreneurship is pushing us

183
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,960
uh to be more uh you know more

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,479
aggressive and more proactive in

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,520
everything that that

186
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
uh that we do which kind of leads me to

187
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
you know one of my fonder memories is my

188
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
time as chair

189
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
and that was the introduction of the

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,880
cipp

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,639
certification program which i think was

192
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
really a defining moment

193
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
for the profession and for the iep

194
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,000
and those were still fairly early days

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
for the iep

196
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,479
we were still in many ways getting our

197
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,960
legs under us as an organization

198
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
and i remember when trevor brought this

199
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,240
up and i thought oh

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
geez you know we're just getting a

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
little bit of financial stability

202
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,080
and sort of figuring things out maybe we

203
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,319
should just go a little slower on this

204
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,639
and uh you know always keeping his eye

205
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,479
on the prize i remember trevor saying if

206
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,840
we don't do it

207
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
else is going to do it and i think he

208
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,759
was absolutely right it was the right

209
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,199
move to do so anyways in the fall of

210
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,080
2004

211
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
orleans that's the conference that used

212
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
to be referred to as the academy

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
was the launch of the inaugural cipp

214
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,120
uh exam and i remember

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
uh that distinctly new orleans of course

216
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
is a very memorable place to begin with

217
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,680
but

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,479
uh anyways proctoring the first exam was

219
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,680
richard purcell

220
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
and richard shows up in a full

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
old-fashioned nuns outfit

222
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
head to toe uh costume on with a with a

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
yardstick in his hand and just added a

224
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
bit of levity to

225
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
uh to the whole event and you know many

226
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,199
people taking that

227
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
certification exam hadn't taken exams in

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,039
a whole bunch of years so there was some

229
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
anxiety there

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
for sure but then i recall afterwards

231
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
flying back from new orleans and running

232
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
into two people

233
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
in the bwi airport who had taken the

234
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,599
exam

235
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,800
and thought that it was important that i

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
understand all the things that were

237
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
wrong with that exam

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,399
double negative questions uh poorly

239
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
written questions

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
you know everything else that happens

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
with a brand new certification exam

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
and then on the way home i i listed

243
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,559
which was about an hour drive for me

244
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
from bwi airport to my home

245
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,120
i had numerous uh messages from other

246
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
test takers who also felt it was

247
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,160
important to

248
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
to share the feedback on that exam so

249
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
anyways

250
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
it has come a long way baby uh in terms

251
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,640
of uh

252
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
certification and it was absolutely the

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
right move at the time

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
uh for sure and here we are today as

255
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
justin you mentioned 25

256
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,839
000 plus uh cipps or variants of cipps

257
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,519
around the globe so a real

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,680
real testament to the profession and

259
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,279
where this has come over the last 20

260
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
years

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
can i just take a quick straw poll from

262
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
everybody how many people on the call

263
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
have ever been approached

264
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
with someone complaining about the

265
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
unfairness of an exam

266
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
or a question

267
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
[Laughter]

268
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
anybody who has not all right so on

269
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
behalf of the google community

270
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
we are grateful you've taken these exams

271
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
we are sorry it is torture

272
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,279
and uh over time this exam

273
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,160
has uh strengthened and gotten better

274
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,720
and

275
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,760
um and even you know there's quite a bit

276
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,519
of science that goes into the testing of

277
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,399
the exam now

278
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240

282
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,200
brianna here i will tell you my own

283
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
story about my own exam

284
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
so when of course we became board

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
members we had to take exam because

286
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,920
trevor said

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,399
what kind of role model are you if

288
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
you're not doing the exam

289
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
um so we i had to take it and my first

290
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
exam

291
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
i was too busy looking for gaps and

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,399
saying these are bad

293
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
questions these are bad answers this

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
could be answered both ways

295
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
and i was writing email as i was taking

296
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
exam to trevor saying

297
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,399
this question is not right by the way

298
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,000
it's multiple choice but it should be

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,959
you know another

300
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,279
answer so you know i remember i almost

301
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,320
flopped my exam

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
because i was too busy looking at the

303
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,680
questions and thinking why are they

304
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
asking this they shouldn't be doing this

305
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,720
so anyway

306
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
but i did pass i know i never know how

307
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,560
good or bad but i did just pass

308
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
i think we all passed that first exam in

309
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,399
2004. we all took

310
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,880
it at the same time i think we all

311
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
passed didn't it

312
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
i don't want to know anymore about it

313
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
damn agnes that's right and we all start

314
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,959
we all came

315
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,440
out and we all started jibber jabbering

316
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,800
saying we have to fix

317
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,760
these questions

318
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,279
so sandy you were you were part of that

319
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,320
posse as well

320
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,680
that sort of initial uh thought leaders

321
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
crew

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,839
and uh i i um

323
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,320
i i wanted to turn to you because sort

324
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
of shifting topics slightly but it but

325
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
it is related

326
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,279
you know for those uh i don't i i don't

327
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,240
want to reference

328
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
uh age but i want to reference

329
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
experience so many people

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
have seen well you called yourself a

331
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,600
grandma that you love

332
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
you love being a grandma and and i know

333
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
i know that a lot of people uh

334
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
particularly

335
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
um newer people in the profession are

336
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
really drawn

337
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
to you for a lot of uh really great

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,519
reasons

339
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,800
i mean i think many uh rightly

340
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
describe you as a pioneer in the

341
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
profession

342
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,639
and and particularly in terms of women's

343
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,600
roles

344
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,519
in in executive functions and

345
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
organizations and i was

346
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
i was hoping you would share with us

347
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
some of your experience

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,200
both while you were you know in in the

349
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,160
house but but

350
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
also subsequently in terms of mentorship

351
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,519
because so many people that uh

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
get involved in the iapp i think are

353
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
very hungry

354
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,839
for those opportunities to seek out

355
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,680
people who have been successful

356
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,079
and want to hear people's stories and

357
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,320
and i'm i'm wondering if

358
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,639
that indeed is your experience it's what

359
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,360
i perceive but i'd love to hear from you

360
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,480
well yeah and i thank you so much justin

361
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
um and it's a role i love and even

362
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
though i've been

363
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,480
rewired from procter and gamble for

364
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
eight years now believe it or

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
not i'm still involved in privacy of

366
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
being on some boards but also for um

367
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
as an executive coach uh with some in

368
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,959
the profession because

369
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
it's true to my heart it's the it's the

370
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,560
right thing to do

371
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
we we face it and everything that we

372
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,480
especially now

373
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,600
are going through and during that time

374
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,639
um okay don't come to me for questions

375
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,839
about that certification because we are

376
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,200
so i won't i can't do that but

377
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,399
you were grandmothered into the

378
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
certification i was grandmothered i was

379
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
grandmothered into that

380
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
and still keep that but i haven't gone

381
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
for anymore because

382
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
a terrible test taker but anyway it was

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
because it was the right thing to do and

384
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
it was the common bar

385
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
we would help each other at different

386
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,279
companies with their programs and just

387
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,480
getting started

388
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
in the privacy profession and so i

389
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
you know even though i was at png i was

390
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,079
helping some of the people at kimberly

391
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,839
clark and others because

392
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,800
that common thread of doing the right

393
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
thing for personal information we wanted

394
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,079
to get it right

395
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,120
across the whole uh spectrum of

396
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,000
companies

397
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
um i remember burger king came up and

398
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,160
and i was helping their

399
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,360
fledgling privacy program and uh of

400
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
course you know it was all free because

401
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
i'm working for p g right but they gave

402
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,800
me some whopper coupons

403
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
which i like passed around to some of

404
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
the staff that were working in privacy

405
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,120
and then um so that kind of you know

406
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,760
still

407
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,959
trying to to help where i can and

408
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,399
um from a gender point of view

409
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,320
um there were some of us who were early

410
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
in the profession

411
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
we kind of banded together as the

412
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
executive women in privacy

413
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
it kind of uh renamed meers used to have

414
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
these great

415
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,360
dinners you know before that everybody

416
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,880
male and female you know would just

417
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,399
clamor to do because they were always

418
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:46,720
such

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
top-notch things and uh she was with a

420
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
consulting firm

421
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
one of her consulting firms at the time

422
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,040
and when she

423
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,240
um retired or left that first firm and

424
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,040
was on her

425
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
own we kind of banded together and said

426
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
you know let's have a women's group

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,839
that kind of grew and then we worked

428
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,120
with the iapp

429
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
and and then they started the women in

430
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,199
privacy and so we kind of handed that

431
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,480
back off but there was a lot of

432
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
mentoring going on in that

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,199
uh especially for women to bring them in

434
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,199
and and grow the profession and i can

435
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,240
remember one of the

436
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,399
the crowning achievements after i had

437
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
rewired from png

438
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,279
came back for the celebration of uh

439
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
the survey that ipp does every year

440
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,120
showed that uh

441
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
there were 50 percent women so the fact

442
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
that we had hit that bar

443
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,240
of 50 50 and you know the salaries were

444
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,880
pretty much

445
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
like in line it's like wow what

446
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
profession can really

447
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,079
claim this you know where women have

448
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,480
an equal set you know seat at the table

449
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,519
there so

450
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
i was really proud of that moment

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
justin if i can jump in on the point

452
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,120
that sandy just made regarding the 50 50

453
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,920
i was

454
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
on the board at the time that that

455
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,759
particular survey results came out and i

456
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,560
remember

457
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
how excited trevor and everyone was

458
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
about this actually could be

459
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
a indicator if you will for how

460
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
the broader tech community could think

461
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
about what it takes

462
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,160
for um there to be a better male female

463
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,399
balance or gender balance within

464
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,160
the tech community at large and we had

465
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
done a number of discussions

466
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,279
out with the media that actually has led

467
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,440
even to now i still have people come

468
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,759
back

469
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,000
and ask questions about what is it about

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
privacy

471
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
what is it about the the profession that

472
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,000
actually

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,959
has enabled that gender parity to be

474
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,079
struck

475
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,040
and what can other look and other

476
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,000
professions

477
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
as well as the industries at large

478
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,839
learned from that so i just think that

479
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,959
was a really

480
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
milestone moment for the iapp and for

481
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,800
the community at large

482
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,680
and justin i wanted to add going back to

483
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,720
the mentorship

484
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
i am a product of being mentored by

485
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
sandy hughes

486
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
and it was more important to me in my

487
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,559
career

488
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
than just about anything that i can

489
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,599
think of

490
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,919
and even today as i think about the

491
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,439
pillars of my program

492
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
they root back when i

493
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,559
i came into iep where we're at five year

494
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
15 years and the first week that i took

495
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,039
over at that time at hp we had a major

496
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
privacy against

497
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
a very visible one it was around pretext

498
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,559
and that week i got two phone calls

499
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,400
and they were both from mentors that

500
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,559
proved to be invaluable to me in my

501
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,120
career

502
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
one was sandy and just offering to help

503
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,760
me through that process the other was

504
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
trevor hughes

505
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
really helping to give me a bit of cover

506
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
as we worked through the incident so

507
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
i'll tell you sandy has probably been

508
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,080
more influential to me in my career than

509
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
any other person

510
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,559
i love her dearly and still today the

511
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,640
concept she came up with that she put in

512
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,200
place

513
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,160
at png in the early years um still

514
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,520
proved to be correct

515
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
i think that so much of what she did

516
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
really created the foundation that

517
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
many of us have benefited from so sandy

518
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
thank you for that

519
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
thank you scott and justin don't shine i

520
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,120

you should feel great about it um

525
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
you know another really influential

526
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,280
person and someone who's been a mentor

527
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,760
to me

528
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
is joanne stoner who is on the call i

529
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
don't want to make you blush or anything

530
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,520
like that

531
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,039
but you i was very lucky

532
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,400
uh because my uh first uh couple of

533
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
years on the board overlapped with yours

534
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,960
and we

535
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,720
we got to uh i got to to observe

536
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
uh a lot of the sort of the leadership

537
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
style that you brought

538
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
but also really learned a lot about

539
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,559
networking and that's something that is

540
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,200
so

541
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,919
important for all of the members of the

542
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,280
organization

543
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,400
and uh i think a lot of networking

544
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
in the iep does happen around physical

545
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,520
conferences

546
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
certainly in the past but also in other

547
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,559
venues and

548
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,440
regulatory environments and i i would

549
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,600
just love to hear from you

550
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
given the experience you've had and the

551
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
successes you've had

552
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,200
um you know what kind of advice do you

553
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,320
have for

554
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
for the members that want to follow in

555
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,120
your footsteps

556
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,760
first of all my mentors are i'm looking

557
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
at them as well so i'm looking at sandy

558
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
and i'm looking at scott and i'm looking

559
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,679
at brendan and i'm looking at hillary

560
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
and i'm looking at guayana

561
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,320
um and all of those folks predated me on

562
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,960
the board

563
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,000
and all of them were mentors to me so

564
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
i learned from i don't know giants in my

565
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,240
opinion as well

566
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,440
so and trevor of course um when i was

567
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
approached to be on the board

568
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
i already knew knew so many of these

569
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
amazing people because of the networking

570
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
of the iapp

571
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
so i met sandy through the executive

572
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,159
women's group

573
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
um boyana and i had the good fortune of

574
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,400
meeting through the center

575
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
for information policy leadership which

576
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,919
she leads now but we were both

577
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,880
members back then and so the iep has

578
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
always been

579
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
a real cornerstone of networking right i

580
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
mean one of the benefits of going to

581
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
summit and it's

582
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
unfortunate this year we couldn't have

583
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
it summit has been a gathering spot

584
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,600
but so has been the congress right um

585
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,440
different events that we've had all

586
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
around the globe

587
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
have really enabled a privacy community

588
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
to emerge right so that's the first

589
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,159
thing that

590
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,159
um i want to say and then even when i

591
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,840
was on the board justin you know this

592
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
and peter you know this and

593
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,480
hillary i think you were part of this as

594
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
post chair we started these crazy pub

595
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
crawls to try to get to all the affinity

596
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,080
groups right

597
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
i hate to admit it was a lot of fun it

598
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
was a lot of drinking too but

599
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,520
in order to really get out and meet the

600
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
membership because the membership

601
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,440
started growing i mean agnes i love the

602
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,120
early day stories because there was only

603
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
about 500 of us at summit or

604
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,679
less right so we could see each other

605
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
when we were in breakout rooms there was

606
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,320
you know

607
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
30 people not you know these huge

608
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
breakout rooms that we have now

609
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
but you know i've had the good fortune

610
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
of also having mentors

611
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,120
that have dragged me along with them

612
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,440
into really interesting conversations

613
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
and boyani you're one of them

614
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,480
um jennifer glasgow is another one

615
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,960
who would drag me across the globe to

616
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
different meetings where they thought my

617
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,720
voice could be helpful

618
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
and so what i would say to our members

619
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
is make friends but make friends

620
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,080
professional friends

621
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,039
and have conversations not just about

622
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,360
what you are personally experiencing but

623
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
what you're professionally experiencing

624
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,360
i mean along with peter and hillary

625
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,400
we had the experience of the gdpr

626
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
right so hillary was the chair in 2016

627
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,200
2017 2018 and we had to help the

628
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,039
membership really figure out how do you

629
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,960
implement this darn thing right when we

630
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,559
finally got the final

631
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,559
wording of the regulation how do you do

632
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,840
it how do you then

633
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,960
really be up on its feet there's so many

634
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,720
ways that as a

635
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
we are subject matter experts and i

636
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
think that's one of the reason

637
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
that women and men do really well in

638
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,600
this profession

639
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,880
is that it requires translating

640
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
law to technology to business

641
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,240
and so we want we wind up needing to be

642
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
great translators

643
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
and what has happened for me i've just

644
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
had the good fortune that

645
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
organizations like the world economic

646
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
forum and the united nations and the

647
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,600
oecd has needed translators at this time

648
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,559
to translate what does all of this mean

649
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,360
for the globe

650
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,080
and so you know but it means that you

651
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
have to be willing to listen

652
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,080
as well and that is also what the iapp

653
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,919
has taught me right we have

654
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
watched from the earliest days agnes

655
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,039
right

656
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,760
of the profession and when i think of

657
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,400
glibba

658
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
right and what we were struggling with

659
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
back then and trying to undo that you

660
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,159
know understand that language to the

661
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,520
language all the way today

662
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,120
of ccpa and the brazil law right

663
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,679
um we still are using some of the same

664
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,400
skills

665
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,480
but how we apply them is different and

666
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
the world has gotten extraordinarily

667
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,280
complex

668
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
and then you throw in things like covid

669
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,480
right um

670
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,640
and the balancing act that all of us are

671
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,480
asked to do and i just think that

672
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
networking is the only way

673
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,360
that we can continue to evolve into the

674
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
new world of data use

675
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,480
right and privacy and security and all

676
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,080
the things that all of us have balanced

677
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
throughout our careers so i've just been

678
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,400
fortunate to have known all of you

679
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,679
because all of you have made me

680
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,320
just incredibly smart so my advice is

681
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
get to know your peers

682
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
get to know them personally and

683
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
professionally and

684
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
it just all happens

685
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,520
great thank you for that um so you said

686
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
a lot of really interesting things they

687
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
were like bon bons on a table

688
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,840
but i'll choose one of them um which

689
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
which was your emphasis on the idea of

690
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
who we are that we are

691
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
subject matter experts and it seems to

692
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,039
me that at the iep and this is true

693
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,799
across the world

694
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
that there's always been this question

695
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,919
or this tension about

696
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,039
is this an organization of lawyers

697
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,600
is it about being a lawyer versus a

698
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,400
non-lawyer

699
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
and i wanted maybe to ask john

700
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,960
jonathan um what your perspective is on

701
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
that i mean you're you're

702
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,360
a very educated prestigious lawyer who's

703
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
definitely embodies in my mind

704
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
that that sort of cadre that was at the

705
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,600
heart and core

706
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,440
of an important uh

707
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,480
timeline in the iapp's development and i

708
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,120
and i just love to hear your thoughts

709
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
whether this is still a lawyer's

710
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,679
profession

711
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,360
is it something more than that what do

712
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
you think and has it changed over time

713
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,600
well i think you're absolutely right

714
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
justin that has been a perennial

715
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,640
question

716
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,559
for the organization and also within the

717
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
departments that we've all been in

718
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
what role do lawyers have and what role

719
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,240
do

720
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
non-lawyers have i think one of the

721
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
things that's challenging as a lawyer

722
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,240
entering the profession

723
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
is that his lawyers were accustomed to

724
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,039
giving advice but not implementing it

725
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,200
so we deliver advice to people and they

726
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
implement it

727
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,880
but being in the privacy profession

728
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
being a chief privacy officer

729
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
that requires a different set of skills

730
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,159
a new set of skills

731
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,240
in addition to having to understand the

732
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,279
law and

733
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,000
at times interpret the law it also

734
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
requires building the processes and

735
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,520
procedures and structures

736
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
that enable implementation of the law

737
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,640
and i think that

738
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,240
that can be a stretch it was a stretch

739
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,799
for me i i've been in both the position

740
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,720
of being a lawyer within a corporate

741
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,840
legal department

742
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,559
and being chief privacy officer and also

743
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,360
being

744
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,000
a a lawyer but not functioning as a

745
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,120
lawyer within

746
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,279
an ethics and compliance department for

747
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,320
two very large

748
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,960
companies in both cases and i think the

749
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
profession has matured

750
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,279
about being more deliberate about the

751
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,159
processes

752
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,279
and the procedures and not just

753
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,240
the legal advice and i think the iep has

754
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
done a very good job in its programming

755
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,279
also of addressing both of those things

756
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
of making sure that our programming

757
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,320
covers

758
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
what is the law what does it say what do

759
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,600
you have to do

760
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,480
but then also how do you implement it so

761
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
conference

762
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
sessions and the publications and

763
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,159
various other things i think have

764
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,600
have served that need well um

765
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
both for the lawyers and for the

766
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
non-lawyers

767
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,520
jonathan you're really right about the

768
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
evolution of that i remember

769
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,320
people were perhaps an attorney but also

770
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
a chief privacy officer

771
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,640
now you're finding that also but you're

772
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
also finding a lot of people in the

773
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,440
legal department

774
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
with privacy responsibilities i think

775
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,960
there's been a real

776
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
growth and an expansion of

777
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
the different roles people play that

778
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
manage privacy

779
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,919
and i think also it takes those

780
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,679
different roles to manage it

781
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,240
well i've had people on my team who are

782
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
formerly bank auditors

783
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,520
i.t auditors at banks and that is a

784
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,960
great addition

785
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,440
to any privacy department because they

786
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
have a set of skills

787
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
that lawyers just don't have unless they

788
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
did that in a prior life

789
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,399
um so it it takes a village to operate a

790
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,080
privacy department

791
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,640
and uh and it can't be comprised just of

792
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
lawyers

793
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,880
i don't know if you all remember i don't

794
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,159
know if you all remember

795
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,720
trevor used to have that slide where he

796
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,200
would show the brain of a data chief

797
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,279
privacy officer of dpo

798
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,120
which was um you know the brain which

799
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
consisted of many different

800
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,520
aspects and and skills and of course

801
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,880
there were legal skills there were

802
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
leadership skills there were

803
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,600
marketing skills there was um you know

804
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
can follow me skill

805
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,000
jump off the cliff but also technology

806
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
skills auditing skills

807
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
joanna i will never forget when you when

808
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,679
we were in hong kong we were talking to

809
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,159
that

810
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,720
audience of hong kong privacy officers

811
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,840
and they said to you

812
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
the chief privacy officer need to be and

813
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
you said they need to be a storyteller

814
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
they need to tell a story to get people

815
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,880
behind them right

816
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,720
and i think it is totally true we need

817
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,799
to resurrect that

818
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,600
slide with that multi-functional brain

819
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,120
and then when i was presenting i used to

820
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,520
say

821
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,440
no wonder there's so many women like

822
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,600
that cheap privacy officer because only

823
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,440
women's brain can have so many different

824
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,000
aspects

825
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,919
but i'm not going to say that now okay

826
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,679
so everybody can be a tree privacy

827
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,159
officer

828
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,399
oh well on that on that note not a lot

829
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,679
of people realize

830
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
that the brain example that trevor took

831
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
was actually

832
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,080
brendan lynch so that that was his brain

833
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,440
and brendan sort of emerged as

834
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
the poster child for this more mature

835
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,159
privacy governance program manager

836
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,679
village leader chief and brendan you

837
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,679
i mean you've had uh and continue to

838
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,880
have a really

839
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
important career as a leader of many

840
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,679
many many people and many processes

841
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,640
in rather mature privacy organizations

842
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,399
even for technology companies that have

843
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
a reputation of being less mature than

844
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,679
other sectors

845
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,440
what's your take on this whole lawyer

846
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,039
non-lawyer

847
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,159
uh trajectory for the for the iapp and

848
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,200
and how it's matured over time

849
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,480
yeah it's it's great it's certainly um

850
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,120
when i think about my career i got into

851
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
the profession

852
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,279
over 20 years ago now through business

853
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,399
consulting

854
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,440
um then went into a tech

855
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
various tech companies um

856
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,039
and i've i've benefited from from many

857
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:53,760
of the folks

858
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
on this call from a mentoring

859
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
perspective

860
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
as a non-lawyer you know i've i've

861
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
received a lot of mentoring from lawyers

862
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,159
and that's been really helpful to

863
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
to balance that out but i do think

864
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,200
that's

865
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
one of the amazing things of this

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
privacy community

867
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,640
and the iapp as the organization that

868
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
supports it

869
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
yes legislation regulation plays a big

870
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,080
role

871
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,760
in what we all do but

872
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,960
we're seeing many enlightened

873
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,799
organizations now also they're going

874
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,440
after

875
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,360
bigger goals than that right people are

876
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,559
going after

877
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,760
goals of building trust um they're going

878
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,039
after build

879
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,320
goals of enabling responsible data use

880
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
but but in a more robust way and privacy

881
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,600
playing a much more supporting role

882
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,039
for that and managing risk and managing

883
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,520
risk

884
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
to people yeah you know managing risk to

885
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,880
to

886
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,960
individuals as well as managing risk to

887
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
companies and

888
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,320
if you do a good job against all those

889
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,039
objectives

890
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,039
arguably the regulatory compliance

891
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,640
almost comes along for free

892
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
because you've you've put in place a

893
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,320
comprehensive program

894
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
but the other aspect of it that i find

895
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,600
you know fascinating today

896
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,120
is the number of types of uh professions

897
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,600
coming in to the privacy world the

898
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
amount of privacy engineers

899
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,519
you know there's there's oper privacy

900
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,880
operations is a

901
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
is much grown you know growing field

902
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,919
particularly in the larger organizations

903
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,679
um and so that's something that i think

904
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,320
it's been impressive to see the iep

905
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,600
catered to that

906
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,960
right from the beginning you know i was

907
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
involved in that first certification

908
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,480
committee i was when people were raising

909
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,600
their hands about you know

910
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,080
exam questions i was thinking gosh i

911
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,320
remember in the first cip

912
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,440
there was actually a web privacy section

913
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,600
um and i had the pleasure of writing

914
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
some of those questions

915
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,760
and i even had there were case studies

916
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,039
there where i'd

917
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,279
you know you had had these various roles

918
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,120
of somebody did this and somebody did

919
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,799
that and what do you think and

920
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,200
i used my parents names and that i that

921
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,279
lasted a few years before

922
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,600
the more professional testing people

923
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,559
came along and

924
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,720
for some reason removed my parents names

925
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
from from the text

926
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,039
sure but generally speaking yeah i think

927
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,799
there's a there's a wide range of

928
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,240
opportunity

929
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
uh for for many people of many

930
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,279
backgrounds to

931
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,360
to really have an important role in

932
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
privacy going forward

933
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
i think you make an important point

934
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
brendan that is that i think the

935
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
profession over those 20

936
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
years has really moved from focusing on

937
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,279
the can we

938
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,240
to the should we uh right we've moved

939
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
from is it legal to is it consistent

940
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,279
with the values

941
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,360
of the organization the of which we're

942
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,720
apart

943
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
and we've been required to be in uh

944
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
observers of the broader sort of privacy

945
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,880
environment and bring it back to our

946
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,000
organization

947
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,279
to interpret and apply it uh and it

948
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,559
definitely transcends merely the law

949
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,399
it does yeah and i think what we're

950
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
seeing is an outgrowth of

951
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,360
of data ethics essentially as a an

952
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,600
outgrowth of privacy in in many ways

953
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
many companies as well my my

954
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,840
undergraduate degree was in philosophy

955
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,279
so what i aspire to be

956
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,200
is a privacy philosopher and i don't

957
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,679
think that job title been defined yet

958
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,080
but

959
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,439
as soon as it is i'm there

960
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,480
well it's a nice jump to hillary because

961
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,120
hillary you and i were talking about

962
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,159
your experience and your focus on

963
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,720
not just ethics and and policy in

964
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,960
technology but the role that technology

965
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,000
has played

966
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
and continues to play for our members

967
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
and helping them

968
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
execute against some of the expectations

969
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,679
of a more mature

970
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,080
modern privacy program can you talk

971
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,240
about some of your thinking in your

972
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,679
journey from

973
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,200
the roles that you've had into something

974
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,360
that's very technology tools

975
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,679
and also the importance of vendors you

976
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,720
know in the iep

977
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,279
community there's been a proliferation

978
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,240
of tools

979
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
and solutions that are becoming

980
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
indispensable

981
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,679
for privacy practitioners to um

982
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,640
to rely upon to achieve expectations of

983
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,440
gdpr

984
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,599
and other more mature programs i'd love

985
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,079
to hear your thoughts on that

986
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,399
oh thank you justin well it's been so

987
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,320
fascinating to listen to everyone talk

988
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,960
about

989
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
the history and evolution of our

990
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,159
profession

991
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,119
and iapp being at the center of enabling

992
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,800
us to all grow

993
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,719
as leaders within the organizations that

994
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,000
we have been part of

995
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,480
and transitioning if you will from in

996
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,639
some cases serving in a legal role to

997
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,839
one that's

998
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
more operational and i'll just go back a

999
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,839
bit to my own journey

1000
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,079
i started out doing privacy actually as

1001
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,040
a marketer

1002
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,960
and then as i was in law school at the

1003
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
time and then as a

1004
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,918
non-lawyer still studying to get her law

1005
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:48,960
degree

1006
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,040
at night and then ultimately then as a

1007
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,239
lawyer for

1008
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
i think about six years or so and then

1009
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,599
transitioned

1010
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,400
over to the compliance part of the

1011
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,560
organization that i was part of

1012
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,599
where we our goal was to move beyond

1013
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,480
as john was saying earlier uh the giving

1014
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,599
of legal advice

1015
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,520
and hoping people followed it and

1016
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,800
throwing some auditors

1017
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
um out to check whether they did to

1018
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
looking much more operationally as to

1019
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
how do we get these things done how do

1020
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,320
you really mobilize the organization to

1021
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,960
have

1022
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,200
accountability and responsibility for

1023
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,119
embedding privacy into what they do

1024
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,119
every day and what's been so interesting

1025
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,240
to me in working with all of you over

1026
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,480
the years and with those at the iep over

1027
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,119
the years just

1028
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,960
how much this continues to evolve and

1029
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
how much gdpr

1030
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,480
has really forced a lot of organizations

1031
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,400
who hadn't yet gotten there

1032
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,920
maybe we're really only looking at

1033
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,079
privacy at a cursory level

1034
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,800
to look at how do we make this part of

1035
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
the fabric of what we do

1036
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,320
because in many respects that

1037
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
accountability principle they added in

1038
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,400
there

1039
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,480
you now have to uh at least for those

1040
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,200
organizations who are moving past

1041
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,040
their surface level of compliance so

1042
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,240
it's been interesting

1043
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,839
as most of you know in 2016 uh scott and

1044
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,520
i have been talking a lot about

1045
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,359
technology i think scott the first time

1046
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,960
i heard you present

1047
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,839
about the technology approach to privacy

1048
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,720
was

1049
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,880
correct i think 2009 2010 time frame you

1050
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,440
were

1051
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
back like the early innovator thinking

1052
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
about the fact that

1053
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
you can't do this stuff well across your

1054
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
whole organization if you're trying to

1055
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,359
rely on

1056
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,440
email and email it just doesn't get you

1057
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,240
there and

1058
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,480
i still remember the tool that you had

1059
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
built in house at hp

1060
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,160
demonstrating that i was talking to

1061
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,240
folks at the time about how to use

1062
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,520
an em basically a document documentum

1063
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,320
type uh repository to manage a lot of

1064
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
what we were trying to do with respect

1065
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
to annual safe harbor compliance

1066
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,720
verification and

1067
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,880
it just didn't quite cut it so fast

1068
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,800
forward to 2016 i remember we were

1069
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,320
talking about um

1070
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
technology in the profession and what

1071
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,359
could be and

1072
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,359
we had tried a bunch of different ways

1073
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,280
uh many of us to

1074
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,359
implement technology within our own

1075
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,800
organizations and i had

1076
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,440
been talking to trevor uh about that

1077
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,079
year's

1078
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,119
board retreat and we were approaching a

1079
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,400
lot of different topics and one of the

1080
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,119
topics

1081
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,359
that we had agreed upon was how do you

1082
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,359
get privacy to scale and this was an

1083
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,359
anticipation of gdpr

1084
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,440
and all the obligations organizations

1085
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,400
had around

1086
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,599
not just the compliance as a general

1087
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,599
matter in terms of the principles

1088
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,200
really getting in and like how do you

1089
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,800
show you're an accountable organization

1090
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
whether you're a controller or a

1091
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,560
processor

1092
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,079
how do you implement all these things

1093
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,240
especially in life

1094
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,760
that people were concerned about and

1095
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
that's when in my view we

1096
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,320
really needed to have a conversation as

1097
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,680
an iep

1098
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,960
community starting with the board of the

1099
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,359
staff about technology and

1100
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,839
i still remember that day and we went

1101
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:50,880
around the room there are a lot of

1102
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,240
different ideas

1103
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,480
we had a fire started conversation and i

1104
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,920
walked out of there and i'm like

1105
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,240
you know what i need to be part of this

1106
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
and make it happen so it's been really

1107
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,839
an interesting journey for me

1108
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,960
over the last four years um trying to

1109
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,599
design

1110
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,920
technology solutions among many many

1111
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
others at the time there were probably

1112
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,320
like 10

1113
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,880
vendors privacy tech vendors in the

1114
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,920
space and now

1115
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,240
i think of last count that trevor shared

1116
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,400
with me were over 300 and it's growing

1117
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,920
day in and day out because there's a

1118
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,480
huge

1119
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,520
need for those of us who manage privacy

1120
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,440
within our organizations

1121
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,920
to actually be able to discover what

1122
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,800
data we have

1123
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,960
how it's being used where it's moving

1124
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,200
and then how to embed

1125
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,119
it into what everybody's doing every day

1126
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,480
and if we know the rest of our

1127
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,960
businesses are becoming digitized

1128
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,040
data-driven and without technology to

1129
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,160
actually support that

1130
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,119
it becomes really really challenging so

1131
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,880
i think it's been interesting

1132
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,599
four years later um to reflect back on

1133
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,359
how much has happened but really

1134
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,440
i think in the absence of a law like

1135
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,599
gdpr it probably wouldn't have happened

1136
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,680
quite at the pace that it has i think

1137
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
pdp was a huge driver

1138
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,160
ccpa is becoming a bigger driver for

1139
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,000
those organizations who weren't

1140
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,119
subject to gdpr and i think where it

1141
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,760
goes

1142
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
you know you can only guess but it's an

1143
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
exciting ride is

1144
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
the entire time being a privacy

1145
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,400
professional has been for so many of us

1146
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
thanks for that hillary um peter so gdpr

1147
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
hit just like covet hit while i am

1148
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,560
chairman

1149
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,599
gdpr hit while you were chairman

1150
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
if i'm not mistaken so

1151
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,720
do you think it had any impact on the

1152
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,880
organization at all

1153
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,560
size you know you know i i think about

1154
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,079
it a little bit differently

1155
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,200
um go back gosh

1156
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,119
15 years ago and we had an iapp

1157
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,720
congress in toronto and they got david

1158
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,040
lucadelis and jennifer stoddart and

1159
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,400
trevor

1160
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,640
and some folding chairs up onto a small

1161
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,359
stage and we all got hockey jerseys

1162
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,520
and that was our big international

1163
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,560
presence that was our

1164
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,760
huge international moment we all had to

1165
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,160
take our passports to go to toronto

1166
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,839
and if you recall at the time the

1167
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,839
european community

1168
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,040
was coming to iap conferences and to

1169
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,319
commissioners conferences

1170
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,040
and it was a us versus europe you know

1171
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,520
americans don't understand privacy

1172
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,240
europeans don't understand americans and

1173
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,800
trevor

1174
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,359
had this view at the time that he was

1175
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:27,920
pushing

1176
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,839
very hard with all of us i think

1177
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,480
that there was no reason that the iapp

1178
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,680
had to be viewed as an american

1179
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,040
organization

1180
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,119
and there was no way that we had to be

1181
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,240
viewed as

1182
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,359
the glba organization or the

1183
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,599
federal privacy act organization and

1184
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,160
you fast forward the time we've all been

1185
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,079
involved with now with gdpr and the iep

1186
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,680
i went to munich gosh the thought of

1187
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,760
traveling is wonderful but i went to

1188
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,520
munich

1189
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,319
for the conference there sold out

1190
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,760
pre-event

1191
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,800
huge event running in two languages even

1192
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,960
paris now running as a major conference

1193
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,240
and really considered to be a standard

1194
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,599
bearer

1195
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,119
as many of you said you know the world

1196
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,880
of accountability is not just the world

1197
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,240
of gdpr

1198
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,720
it set the framework for what a lot of

1199
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
us do

1200
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
um frankly it goes back to a lot of what

1201
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,160
um scott sandy and brendan and others

1202
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,280
have been doing

1203
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,839
for many years and teaching all of us

1204
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,200
for many years

1205
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,960
but but this is now the international

1206
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,119
standard and and and for

1207
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,760
trevor to have thought ten years in

1208
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,119
advance

1209
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,880
that this was where the profession was

1210
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,040
going and that this was where the iapp

1211
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,200
was going um it's so forward-looking and

1212
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,000
i think it's

1213
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
played a really big part in getting us

1214
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,440
where we are

1215
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,119
so to answer your question dustin it's a

1216
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,480
very long way of answering the question

1217
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,960
but

1218
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,839
i don't think gdpr did this to the iep i

1219
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,319
think trevor saw it coming

1220
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,280
and i think he got out ahead of it um so

1221
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
but before i pass

1222
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,319
i i i want to go back to a discussion

1223
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:14,960
that

1224
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,319
joanne was having about about um

1225
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,720
networking and i'll tell a very brief

1226
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,680
story

1227
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
i i remember back when the conference

1228
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,440
was at woodley park

1229
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,280
and uh you know the big events there

1230
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,200
were the the networking

1231
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,359
particularly the microsoft party and the

1232
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,720
in the the

1233
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,839
suite off to the side and the old tower

1234
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,880
um and one year

1235
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,599
my beloved joe aladef and i went up to

1236
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,800
the conference

1237
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,240
and we didn't buy passes and we sat

1238
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,520
at the the table in the coffee shop that

1239
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,960
was closest to the entrance of the

1240
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,760
conference

1241
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,200
and we were meeting with people and we

1242
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,359
were getting tremendous mad out of it

1243
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,520
trevor came up to us and said okay you

1244
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,560
knuckleheads

1245
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,640
i've gotten new passes go in and learn

1246
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,160
something

1247
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,560
but it was a statement it was a

1248
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
statement that

1249
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,720
ours is a profession of learning from

1250
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,839
each other

1251
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,720
of being around each other of seeing

1252
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,160
what's happening

1253
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,200
and like great athletes advancing on it

1254
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,960
you know trying to do the mile a little

1255
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,800
bit faster

1256
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,319
and to the extent that i've um

1257
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,839
played any role in that it's on the

1258
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,440
backs of all of you so thank you

1259
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,800
oh it's very that's very very kind words

1260
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,359
oh and i'm i'm actually super happy that

1261
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,520
you mentioned canada unfortunately

1262
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,119
one of our former chair people who was

1263
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,800
able to join us briefly and then had to

1264
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,200
leave

1265
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
jeff came up through the ranks of the

1266
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,200
the canada chapter but

1267
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,640
it's a good segue to another big

1268
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,480
area um that i think characterizes

1269
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,200
the experience of an increasing number

1270
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,960
of our members which is this issue

1271
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,760
of the ipp being headquartered in the

1272
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
united states

1273
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,359
there's a lot of american figures

1274
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
including on this call

1275
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,000
that have been leaders of the

1276
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
organization and

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,160
there's been a significant amount of

1278
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,280
growth

1279
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,720
um outside the united states and lyanna

1280
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,000
i would love to open the door

1281
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,800
to hearing you know your reflections on

1282
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,680
that

1283
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,760
change as well because certainly

1284
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,200
something i've been personally very

1285
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,839
focused on

1286
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,359
as somebody who's based in hong kong um

1287
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,960
but i'd love to hear i'd love to hear

1288
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,560
your your thoughts about this whole

1289
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,079
international

1290
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,280
flavor of the iep over time thank you

1291
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,520
justin and um

1292
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,400
you all know i do i used to joke a lot

1293
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,960
about

1294
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,880
um the fact that i was the i

1295
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,520
in the iapp because it's true when i

1296
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,800
came on board

1297
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
um uh to the board it was 2008 i think

1298
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:54,560
um

1299
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,240
2009 um you know it was

1300
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
the organization was perceived very much

1301
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,599
as u.s focused

1302
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,760
but but trevor had bigger ambition and i

1303
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,359
think he was totally right

1304
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,000
um and you know yes i was maybe a token

1305
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,400
first

1306
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,599
european uh on the board um and first

1307
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,040
international non-new

1308
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,960
non-us person but look where we've come

1309
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,280
now so i can't think of another

1310
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,319
profession

1311
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,359
or area of law which is as global

1312
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,720
in its nature uh as privacy

1313
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,319
and there is something special about the

1314
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,400
international aspect of people who we

1315
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,440
meet as well

1316
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,280
they're all drawn to this privacy for

1317
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,440
the same reasons it's a little bit like

1318
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
doing postgraduate or being in in a in

1319
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,000
essentially like-minded people

1320
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,720
uh you know at some kind of meeting or

1321
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,920
conference

1322
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,319
there is really a special camaraderie

1323
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,079
about this international group of people

1324
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:46,560
who all

1325
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,720
feel the same yet they all come from

1326
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
very different backgrounds

1327
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,119
and very culturally view privacy very

1328
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,040
differently as well so

1329
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,520
in today's world although globalization

1330
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,960
is not very fashionable

1331
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
and in this post-corbid world in fact we

1332
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,040
will have deglobalization i think

1333
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
we are just going to see more of

1334
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,000
globalization of our privacy profession

1335
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
data is flowing and will be flowing

1336
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,800
uh solutions to privacy

1337
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,200
will be flowing technology best

1338
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,720
practices as well

1339
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
uh there the laws are converging as well

1340
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,839
and to

1341
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,200
peter's point it was the us who invented

1342
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,520
chief privacy officer not the gdpr

1343
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,640
right but hey now we all have data

1344
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,400
privacy officers and chief privacy

1345
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,760
officers so

1346
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,160
i kind of think that with technology

1347
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,880
being global in digitalization still

1348
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,440
coming on accelerating after covid we

1349
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,359
are going to see even bigger exposure of

1350
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,280
international in the ipp

1351
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,720
and in those days of course it was

1352
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,760
europe but today it's latin america

1353
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,119
i mean that's where things are moving

1354
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,880
everybody is now interested in brazilian

1355
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,240
data protection law

1356
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,319
in the changes in argentina there is

1357
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,599
this new army of privacy enthusiasts and

1358
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,599
privacy officers coming from there but

1359
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,960
the same with india

1360
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,040
and asia as well i i just i know you're

1361
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,800
in asia and it is exciting to be

1362
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,960
there because some of the best solutions

1363
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,560
potentially for the

1364
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,720
accountable ai or machine learning maybe

1365
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,760
coming from

1366
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,160
some research and development labs in

1367
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,960
the in

1368
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,960
china um or asia as well as perhaps

1369
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,440
us and europe so we really need to keep

1370
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,079
focusing

1371
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,640
on growing this profession and really

1372
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,160
learning from each other as much as

1373
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,040
possible

1374
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,559
um i wanted to kind of remind um

1375
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,480
you asked us to think about interesting

1376
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
point um

1377
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,559
that the world really is very flat when

1378
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,079
it comes to privacy

1379
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,079
so when um i was hoping in my job

1380
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,920
at that time i was heading private

1381
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,280
accenture i was hoping

1382
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,440
to

1383
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,200
to look for pay rise right and i knew

1384
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,240
that in fact

1385
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
there was some amazing leaders out there

1386
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,480
like harriet pierce and nola connor

1387
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,000
and i knew that there was never any more

1388
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,440
than i did so i reached out to them

1389
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,079
right

1390
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,839
out across the atlantic because of

1391
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,599
course salaries were bigger in the u.s

1392
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,440
we knew that but there was no survey

1393
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,880
data but we knew that was the case

1394
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,640
and i said to them look i need to do

1395
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,160
something about my own salary my own

1396
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,079
position the company what can i do

1397
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,839
what kind of benchmark can you provide

1398
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,240
me and you know they provided that

1399
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
and isn't that amazing you know that

1400
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,520
sort of camaraderie that

1401
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,760
sharing of information very personal as

1402
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,359
well to help me

1403
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,480
actually get ahead in my own role and i

1404
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,119
think that's

1405
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,960
and this was done across the atlantic

1406
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,400
across the borders

1407
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,040
and i really hope today's privacy

1408
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,960
offices that are merging

1409
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,079
in asia latin america in africa i hope

1410
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,680
they reach out to all of us

1411
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,359
and i hope we also reach out to them

1412
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,880
because they're going to be finding new

1413
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,520
ways

1414
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,359
in which they're going to be delivering

1415
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,880
this accountability

1416
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,800
this new compliance much more much

1417
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,000
different than perhaps

1418
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,760
ours were so i kind of love that

1419
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,440
cultural diversity about

1420
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,240
ipps and i really do hope that grows as

1421
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,960
well

1422
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,160
um and one last point um of a kind of

1423
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,200
leadership

1424
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,839
lesson that i have learned through ipp

1425
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,559
when i

1426
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,559
was approached to put for the board

1427
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,119
position it was a really busy time in my

1428
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,640
life

1429
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,800
personally at home i had three children

1430
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,400
i was just promoted in

1431
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,920
a senior role at accenture and i had a

1432
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,880
lot on

1433
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,960
and nola and trevor came and said you

1434
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,359
know we'd love to have you on the board

1435
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,720
and you know next year you're going to

1436
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,640
be could you be the vice chair because

1437
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,760
next year you could

1438
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,000
become the chair and i sort of said no

1439
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
way i cannot possibly take this

1440
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
on on top of everything else that i have

1441
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,200
got

1442
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,839
but hey how wrong i was and i said no

1443
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,000
and they said no no but you ma

1444
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,079
i took that leap of faith saying yep you

1445
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,240
know i'm somehow going to manage

1446
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,800
another role on top of 15 others that

1447
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,680
i've had

1448
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,000
and it was the most amazing time and and

1449
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,440
i'm telling you this story because i

1450
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,880
want to make sure that everybody who is

1451
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,000
listening to us

1452
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,400
realizes the potential that this

1453
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,760
international

1454
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,800
community of privacy people has got you

1455
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,160
know so much to give you

1456
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,280
so much to um uh help you with so please

1457
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,240
never be

1458
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,520
shy to kind of take away um

1459
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,400
the helping hand and the reaching hand

1460
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,559
and if you look at some of the leaders

1461
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,720
that we have amongst us you know joanne

1462
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,160
you are one of the leader who has

1463
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,240
pot transcended privacy is now chief

1464
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,520
data officer

1465
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,200
uh we have got keith sandrite who is

1466
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,920
sitting on a board as a privacy expert

1467
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,680
on the board of another company

1468
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,839
so i think this is hugely exciting and i

1469
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,920
really felt i needed to say a plug

1470
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,839
for our profession because i think the

1471
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,359
skills that we have got

1472
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,680
and that cultural diversity and the

1473
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,160
ability to see beyond just our law

1474
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
beyond just our country beyond just our

1475
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,240
company it is something special about

1476
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,760
the people who do privacy

1477
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,680
and no matter whether they're in the

1478
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,040
globe as well

1479
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,559
so long may it continue well said

1480
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,680
boyana well said um that

1481
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,680
brings us actually very nicely to the

1482
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,800
present

1483
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,760
and kalinda i'm turning to you because

1484
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,359
you and i happen to be

1485
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,960
right next to each other in terms of the

1486
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
sequence we're lucky we still have you

1487
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,000
on the board

1488
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,839
you are the outgoing former chairperson

1489
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,880
and you uh lead our nominating committee

1490
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,240
for the coming year for the board of

1491
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,319
directors and you've been a really

1492
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,359
important leader in the in the past

1493
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,960
several years cycle

1494
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,520
on this point of diversity i feel like

1495
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,240
that is a

1496
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,359
very important um it's not

1497
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,920
exclusively important now it's always

1498
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,280
been important

1499
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,160
but now it is something that is getting

1500
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,680
radically more attention

1501
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,640
than i think it did even uh in the past

1502
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,760
few years

1503
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,520
and i and i wanted to hear your thoughts

1504
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,040
about that you know we're talking about

1505
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,599
it now

1506
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,160
as a board and as an organization and

1507
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,839
the importance of diversity from

1508
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,920
lots of different perspectives boyana

1509
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,960
touched on

1510
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,480
diversity from an international and

1511
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,079
cultural perspective

1512
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,240
earlier sandy was talking about gender

1513
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,160
what are your thoughts on the kinds of

1514
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,240
diversity topics we need to be tackling

1515
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,079
as a profession now

1516
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,760
well thanks so much for that justin and

1517
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,559
i think uh one key part of diversity

1518
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,079
as many of you who have watched this

1519
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,079
would have seen is is that of the

1520
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,359
mothers that i see

1521
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,760
in iapp and my daughter who has

1522
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,960
continuously

1523
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,920
run back and forth throughout the call

1524
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,319
one of the things that really

1525
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,440
drew me to to this community in the

1526
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,160
early days was the fact that it was

1527
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,119
so diverse in reality i think one of the

1528
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,359
things we often forget is that

1529
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,119
um 20 years ago uh outside of

1530
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,040
um you know maybe the healthcare and

1531
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,800
financial industries there wasn't a lot

1532
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,200
of space for privacy and there was a

1533
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,559
a view of the fact that like we'll pass

1534
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,319
it off to whoever's willing to take it

1535
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:52,960
on

1536
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,599
um i i was one of those rare birds who

1537
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,839
got interested in it in college

1538
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,240
and so when the iapp when i learned

1539
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,280
about the iapp

1540
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,839
it was like uh boyana said like coming

1541
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,599
home it was like graduate school there's

1542
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,800
all these people who are actually

1543
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,559
talking about the same issues and i

1544
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,359
think

1545
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,520
um that that sort of beginning for our

1546
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,559
community

1547
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,040
of a lot of people who were on the the

1548
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,880
outskirts of things were just trying to

1549
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,359
find

1550
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,640
um this unique kind of carve out within

1551
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,440
the law

1552
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,480
where it balanced fairness and ethical

1553
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,200
issues

1554
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,319
and uh things that we all thought would

1555
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,960
would eventually uh as technology has

1556
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,800
developed to where we see it today

1557
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,079
give people um the ability to control

1558
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,240
their data and their lives i think

1559
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,640
it brought about a very diverse group of

1560
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,359
people

1561
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,599
and i think that is one of the benefits

1562
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,800
of our community

1563
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,319
is uh many of us are tied by this

1564
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,920
desire to do good by this desire to see

1565
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,280
technology have a a

1566
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,280
version of itself that allows for

1567
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,760
people to have freedom and protection

1568
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,319
for it not to be used in a bad way

1569
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,480
and that brings together just a

1570
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,880
wonderful group of people from

1571
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,000
um globally internationally i think i

1572
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,559
i feel very special being the first east

1573
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,240
indian to be on the board

1574
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,040
um i think the fact that we have so many

1575
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,680
women

1576
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,160
as well in this profession is something

1577
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,359
that made me

1578
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,319
feel quite honestly 20 years ago like i

1579
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:26,800
could

1580
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,440
be somebody in this profession and rise

1581
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,559
up in it so

1582
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,079
i i look to all the faces on this call

1583
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,040
and just think

1584
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
i can't believe i'm even amongst all of

1585
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,359
you because i remember

1586
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,200
my first iep conference in 2006

1587
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,880
going and seeing many of you and

1588
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,960
thinking that oh if i could get them to

1589
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,799
talk to me how exciting so

1590
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,000
i i feel uh very special

1591
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,839
to be on this call and to be able to say

1592
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,079
what a a wonderful profession we have

1593
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,000
that allows you to focus on

1594
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,359
values and ethics um and still

1595
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,960
still be a um a woman

1596
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,119
who can succeed and not feel there's any

1597
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,480
limits on it as well

1598
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,760
as a mom quite honestly um

1599
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,000
i sit here in my kids playroom and i

1600
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,480
think similar to boyana when i was first

1601
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,440
approached

1602
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,040
about the board by hillary one of my

1603
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
concerns was i had a newborn

1604
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,200
uh daughter and how would i manage it

1605
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,640
and now she's

1606
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,359
five and running through my calls and it

1607
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,280
and i'm so glad i took it on and that

1608
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,960
i've had the opportunity

1609
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,079
to do this

1610
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,880
thanks for that kalinda and it it it's

1611
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,119
it's also a reminder i think you know as

1612
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,880
we close out the hour that we had

1613
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,640
together which is really unique

1614
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,440
and i'm excited that the iapp was able

1615
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,040
to make it happen even if we have to do

1616
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
this in a virtual environment

1617
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,640
um it's the 20th anniversary of an

1618
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,559
organization and i think as we've seen

1619
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,720
even in talking to one another it's a

1620
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,400
mature enough profession that we

1621
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,880
actually have generations now

1622
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,960
where you can you can see new people

1623
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,559
entering that you know maybe never

1624
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,680
worked with or met

1625
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,760
some of the the really really senior

1626
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
leaders that came before them i remember

1627
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,200
job applications you know or even

1628
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,920
posting

1629
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,720
uh jobs that people could apply for and

1630
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,480
you would ask for somebody that had 10

1631
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
years of privacy experience and that was

1632
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,760
a silly thing to ask for

1633
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,000
because there were so few you could

1634
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,839
count them on one hand back in the day

1635
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,040
and now

1636
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,119
that kind of maturity is actually

1637
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,240
becoming possible

1638
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,000
in the recruitment cycle and so i think

1639
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,920
this idea of generations

1640
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,160
after 20 years of experience and many

1641
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,079
more years ahead of us is an exciting

1642
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,359
one and it's one

1643
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,559
that's inclusive where instead of being

1644
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:42,839
an

1645
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,400
exclusive club of insiders who talk

1646
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,280
to themselves the iapp and one of the

1647
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,799
things that i love about it is that it's

1648
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,559
expanding

1649
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,760
in its inclusiveness of technologists of

1650
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,839
lawyers of auditors of accountants

1651
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,880
of new workforce members

1652
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,480
of uh job transitioners it's just

1653
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,559
it's it's a it's a path that so many

1654
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,160
people can follow and for the people

1655
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,319
that took the time to watch this video

1656
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,040
and listen to in particular some of the

1657
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,520
village elders that are here to help

1658
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,799
um professional village elders

1659
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,880
um i think it's an exciting time for a

1660
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,000
lot of people and i hope

1661
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,880
uh everyone enjoyed uh hearing people's

1662
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,319
stories and anecdotes and i want to

1663
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,480
thank you again on behalf of trevor

1664
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,799

to the iapp as well as trevor

1670
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,839
i think we've heard so many times from

1671
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,599
each of us talking about

1672
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,480
trevor's leadership i was jotting down a

1673
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,200
forward

1674
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,880
looking bigger ambition entrepreneurial

1675
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,280
i think we're also here today from a lot

1676
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,799
