00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,960
hi welcome to this special I 80 note

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,710
panel the platform's way in privacy

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,920
exposure notification and contact

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,480
tracing the past few months have been

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,400
uncharted territory for all of us and

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,070
that really means all of us citizens of

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,520
the world as we deal with the covet 19

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,030
pandemic this crisis has far-reaching

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,059
implications for Public Health primarily

11
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,910
of course but also for the economy and

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,430
for society writ large

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,629
it also has brought a wave of new issues

14
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,789
and implications for us privacy

15
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,329
professionals is issues such as working

16
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,850
or studying from home on virtual

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,030
platforms returning to the office trying

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,370
to keep employees safe while protecting

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,880
their rights and privacy health care

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,090
research and much much more as we work

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,610
through all of these issues technology

22
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,460
is a valuable tool that can and should

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,770
aid policymakers and public health

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,970
officials fight the pandemic one central

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,360
issue that we have seen is the testing

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,229
tracking and tracing of new patients of

27
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,450
course contact tracing is an age-old

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,450
practice as Nicole will later elaborate

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,900
public health officials have deployed it

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
for many many years

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,119
but now technology can digitally assist

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,880
in identifying individuals who were

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,159
exposed to the virus and alerting them

34
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,549
to get tested and to quarantine as

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,490
providers of the dominant operating

36
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,079
systems for a vast majority of

37
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,869
smartphone users Google and Apple have

38
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,000
been at the forefront of this discussion

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,700
and they came together to remove

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,979
barriers from and to enable the

41
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,500
development of exposure notification

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,660
applications

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,819
it's a special privilege for us to host

44
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,010
the leading privacy officer

45
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,569
at both Apple and Google in one session

46
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,400
respectively Janne Horvath from Apple

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,370
and Keith Enright from Google and that's

48
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,680
an even greater privilege for us to have

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,019
this session moderated by Nicole Wong

50
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,250
who has a long illustrious career in

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,209
privacy and tech policy formerly the

52
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,640
deputy chief technology officer for the

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,099
United States and the Obama

54
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,049
administration so with this I will hand

55
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,109
it over to you Nicole perfect thank you

56
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,079
so much and thank you for hosting this

57
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,000
conversation it's a it's a fascinating

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
topic and a deeply challenging and

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,829
uncertain time so I'll just be

60
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,019
facilitating our discussion but truly my

61
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,690
two friends Keith and Jane need very

62
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,459
little assistance from me I have the

63
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,590
privilege of working with both of them

64
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,260
what seems like several lifetimes ago

65
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,389
when I was at Google you know when we

66
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,489
chisel privacy policies from stone

67
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,310
tablets and things like that but it's a

68
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,139
delight to have this reunion with both

69
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,790
of you today and to see you and your

70
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,680
companies working together on this

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,639
really important joint project so maybe

72
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,980
to start I'll do a little bit of a set

73
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,510
up and then I'm gonna let both of you

74
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,239
talk about the work we expose your

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,190
notification system from Apple and

76
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,019
Google and we're gonna need a shorthand

77
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,090
for that at some point in this

78
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,730
conversation is a tool to improve the

79
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,500
ability of public health agencies to do

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,690
contact tracing so for those who aren't

81
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,519
steeped in that topic it might be worth

82
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,169
a couple minutes to explain why that's

83
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,230
important as Omar said in the

84
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,269
introduction contact tracing is not new

85
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,370
it dates back to the 19th century

86
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,680
it was used to identify the actual

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,909
typhoid mary

88
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,400
in 1907 as the source of the outbreak of

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,709
the disease disease in new york it's

90
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,659
particularly useful for methods of

91
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,010
diseases that are transmitted by

92
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,739
droplets in the air or by direct human

93
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,829
contact hence it's important today with

94
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,769
the transmission of coded 19 but it was

95
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,079
also used in the campaign to eradicate

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
smallpox which was finally done in 1979

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,260
the SARS outbreak in the US and 2003

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,420
the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014 in

99
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,610
she´ll when someone's diagnosed with one

100
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,920
of these highly contagious diseases the

101
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,690
diagnosis is shared with the patient and

102
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,510
her doctor and also the local public

103
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,150
health agency and then that agency

104
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,040
assigns a contact tracer to followup

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,380
with the patient about her symptoms her

106
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,120
close context during the period of

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
infection and to come up with an

108
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,370
isolation plan and then the tracer goes

109
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,350
and finds all of that patients contacts

110
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,510
to see if they are also ill and to

111
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,400
monitor them for some period of time for

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
possible infection so that's it in a

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,350
nutshell I think it's also important to

114
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,660
know that the tracing is just one part

115
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,420
of a three-prong public health program

116
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,580
which we've now heard repeatedly in

117
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,150
recent months test trace and isolate and

118
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,690
so here with your joint project Jane and

119
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,730
Keith we're focused on that trace part

120
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,400
of the strategy so with that background

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
why don't we start first with an

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,170
explanation of the Apple Google exposure

123
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,470
notification system and what it does

124
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,540
great Nicole thank you so much and it is

125
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,810
a pleasure to be on a panel with the two

126
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,090
of you and I also want to thank the ia

127
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,900
pp for hosting this panel Nicole gave a

128
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,630
little background on what contact

129
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,060
tracing is and as you were listening it

130
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,780
really involves a lot of contact tracer

131
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,970
ask a person who they've been in contact

132
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,000
with but we all recognize the reality of

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,370
the world that we live in today we come

134
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,590
into contact very often with people we

135
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,030
don't know and and so early on in the

136
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,980
pandemic there was a lot of thought of

137
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,330
how could cell phone data be used to do

138
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,570
contact tracing and and there were a

139
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,220
number of reach outs from public health

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,510
authorities to both Google and Apple and

141
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,460
and in people were looking at existing

142
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,150
technologies that the telephones had

143
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,980
including location including Bluetooth

144
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,180
and and none of those were really the

145
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,250
right thing and so we realized that we

146
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,890
need we could use Bluetooth technology a

147
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,470
modified version and a more privacy

148
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,250
friendly

149
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,490
a Bluetooth to help with the contact

150
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,040
tracing and in a minute I'll walk you

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,810
through a schematic that shows exactly

152
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,240
how this works but essentially we

153
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,910
developed exposure notifications which

154
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,180
is a type of Bluetooth that allows for

155
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,220
you to receive notifications on your

156
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,920
phone do we have the presentation up so

157
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,200
they allow you to receive notifications

158
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,660
on your phone if you test positive the

159
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,400
important thing here and it's something

160
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,320
that Keith will discuss in more detail

161
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,270
when we talk about the privacy features

162
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,220
is we had a decision to make whether we

163
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,100
wanted to share whether this technology

164
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,050
was going to basically send these

165
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,570
indicators to a centralized place or

166
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,030
whether we could use device processing

167
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,390
and thereby more be more privacy

168
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,530
friendly so exposure notifications uses

169
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,020
device side processing and so all of

170
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,740
your contacts or potential exposures are

171
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,590
actually stored on your device and only

172
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,940
when you are diagnosed do is a report

173
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,040
made to the Public Health Authority

174
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,800
again as I was saying earlier it's

175
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,260
really meant to augment the existing

176
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,050
contact tracing efforts it's an attempt

177
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,630
to help find all of those people that

178
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,850
you actually couldn't identify to about

179
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,280
Public Health Authority when you went in

180
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,850
for a post Cova diagnosis to tell them

181
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,050
all the people that you had been around

182
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,390
and then the most important thing here

183
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,820
is we are working very very closely with

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,979
the public health authorities on this so

185
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,410
Google and Apple have developed a

186
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,930
technology and it's a technology that

187
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,300
will allow if you are sitting it doesn't

188
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,250
matter whether you have an iOS device or

189
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,870
whether you have an Android device you

190
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,929
will be able to exchange these exposure

191
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,650
keys and so they're interoperable but

192
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,780
the public health authorities are going

193
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,820
to decide how the notifications will be

194
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,910
triggered what the next steps are to

195
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,010
advise someone who's been possibly

196
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,620
exposed and how to reach exposed

197
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,900
individuals for further contact in

198
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
containment initiatives next slide

199
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,830
please so how will exposure

200
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,040
notifications work this shows a graph of

201
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
potential people coming into contact we

202
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,650
have two slides with a schematic that

203
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,529
walk through a potential exposure next

204
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,900
slide so Alice and Bob are sitting on a

205
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,970
park bench they've been out for a walk

206
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,630
they don't know each other and but there

207
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,480
they're not sitting like more than six

208
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,670
feet apart and they're sitting there for

209
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,320
a bit of a bit of time and Bob is then

210
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,080
subsequently diagnosed with covin 19:00

211
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,040
and as part of the process he actually

212
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,950
has to enter the test result into the

213
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,230
app from the Public Health Authority so

214
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,970
I need to back up a little bit so the

215
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,910
important thing is Alison Bob have

216
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,520
already downloaded the public health

217
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,400
authorities exposure notification app

218
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,070
since I live in San Mateo County we will

219
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,980
assume maybe it's the California

220
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,230
exposure notification app that each one

221
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,050
of them has downloaded so and they're

222
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,080
carrying their phones in their pocket so

223
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,420
Bob is diagnosed he enters those results

224
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,370
into the California app and this is all

225
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,140
hypothetical because we don't have that

226
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,020
happy yet and he interests the test

227
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,730
results in to his Public Health

228
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,050
Authority and when Bob and Alice were

229
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,089
sitting on the park bench their phones

230
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,290
were actually exchanging beacons to show

231
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,390
that they had been in contact with each

232
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,000
other and you can see in this schematic

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,370
that they were in contact with each

234
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,160
other about 15 minutes so each phone

235
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,370
exchanges our exposure notification keys

236
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,720
and they stay on device so when Bob is

237
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,150
then test test positive

238
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,310
he enters it into the Public Health

239
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,910
Authority and with Bob's consent meaning

240
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,560
he will actually have to take an

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,650
affirmative action to say that he wants

242
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,970
to upload the last 14 days of his keys

243
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,520
to the Public Health Authority for two

244
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,380
server of the Public Health Authority

245
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,140
next slide please so Alex continues her

246
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,020
day unaware that she's been near a

247
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,690
potentially contagious person but her

248
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,050
phone is busy periodically downloading

249
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,480
the Bluetooth beacon keys of everyone

250
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,240
who has tested positive for Kovan 19 in

251
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
her region and if a match is found and

252
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,660
here a match is found with bob's random

253
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,110
bluetooth identifier and so her phone

254
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,480
says ah got a match and the app then

255
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,010
triggers a notification that

256
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,500
notification is something that has been

257
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,960
written by the Public Health Authority

258
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,810
here is just an example alert you've

259
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,400
recently come in contact with someone

260
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,310
who's tested positive for koban 19 tap

261
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,790
for more information and Alice's phone

262
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,440
will receive a notification with

263
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,740
information about what to do next

264
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,720
now Keith is going to talk about some of

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
the privacy protections that we've built

266
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,180
into this technology Keith thanks Jane

267
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,330
next slide please

268
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,160
so just sort of elaborating a little bit

269
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,370
on what Jane has already said when the

270
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,210
hope in crisis surface there was a

271
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,500
tremendous amount of energy inside of

272
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,270
Google and I'm sure inside of Apple as

273
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,000
well at all levels of the company trying

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,980
to determine how we could help what

275
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,980
could we do to leverage our skills the

276
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,260
things that we do well to assist public

277
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,450
health authorities in responding to this

278
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,640
crisis as efficiently and effectively as

279
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,210
they could initially we received a lot

280
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,910
of inbound questions about location data

281
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,050
like maybe you would be able to use

282
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,750
location data to support contact tracing

283
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,090
and it turned out that wasn't actually

284
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,040
the the right data step for a whole

285
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,810
bunch of reasons it's not complete

286
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,640
enough it's not accurate enough and

287
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,620
obviously there are very strong privacy

288
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,570
concerns associated with location

289
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,100
information that could be derived from

290
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,030
somebody's device but serendipitously in

291
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,010
a bunch of places roughly in parallel

292
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,470
folks started talking about Bluetooth

293
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,940
proximity as a potential Avenue for

294
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,110
supporting contact tracing efforts

295
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,910
through some sort of elevated exposure

296
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,350
notification

297
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,010
so we were having conversations with

298
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,750
experts in academia and in other areas

299
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,660
and came to our friends at Apple and

300
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,610
kicked off this conversation but okay

301
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,990
maybe we can collaborate maybe there's

302
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,550
something we would be able to do that

303
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,610
would allow us to expand the speed and

304
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,700
the scope of exposure notification in a

305
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,560
way that was optimized for privacy

306
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,020
protection and that was really the

307
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,000
mission that we took on we knew we can't

308
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,190
solve the problem of contact tracing we

309
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,440
can't deliver that that is up to public

310
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,000
health authorities they've been doing it

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
for a very long time as Nicole was

312
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,500
laying out what we can do is try to

313
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,870
leverage the unique capabilities of

314
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,420
technology so that we can allow contact

315
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,350
tracing to get better data faster and

316
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,120
allow sort of that information to be

317
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
used to notify people who have been

318
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,830
exposed more efficiently based on

319
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,390
criteria that are set by their Public

320
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,220
Health Authority so they can respond

321
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,470
responsibly and hopefully we can slow

322
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,560
the spread of the virus and and help get

323
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
people back to work and get the economy

324
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,100
moving again

325
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,110
some of the key decisions that we were

326
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,090
making in the course of the early design

327
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,430
phases of this it was absolutely

328
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,410
essential to us that users have to

329
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,870
explicitly consent to turning on

330
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,910
exposure notifications and we want to

331
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,320
make sure that they have the ability to

332
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,350
turn them off at any time user control

333
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,480
was essential to this we did not want to

334
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,820
create a system that was not completely

335
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,800
transparent and persistently under the

336
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,560
control of the user we also wanted to

337
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,840
make sure from the beginning that this

338
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,360
doesn't collect or use device location

339
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,760
information including for users who have

340
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
tested positive so we've gone to great

341
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,610
lengths to ensure that all of the apps

342
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,980
that call the api's that are making

343
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,500
available adhere to some strict

344
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,600
guidelines that we have issued that

345
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,670
prohibit them from collecting or using

346
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,150
device location information we also want

347
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,410
to make sure that users themselves

348
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,750
decide whether they want to report a

349
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,820
positive diagnosis this isn't something

350
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,590
that's automated users remain in control

351
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,450
user identities won't be known to other

352
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,870
users so this technology and its core is

353
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,850
fundamentally anonymous especial

354
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,009
really to Google and Apple we do not

355
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,980
know a users diagnosis we do not know

356
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,170
their identity by virtue of them using

357
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,370
this technology the key design feature

358
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,430
perhaps beyond everything else that has

359
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,589
been to the focus of most of the

360
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,959
external discussion around this has been

361
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,079
our decision to be sure that matching

362
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,110
for exposure notification is done on the

363
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,170
device under the users control there

364
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,579
were alternative designs that were

365
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,019
proposed and we're very actively

366
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,410
discussed where you had central servers

367
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,089
that were doing more of that processing

368
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,569
and more of that association of

369
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,050
diagnosis keys with individual users we

370
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,839
put it back hard on that and we felt

371
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,790
strongly that all this exposure

372
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,709
notification information being done on

373
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,959
device but the processing being done

374
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,639
under these sort of strict control of

375
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,009
the user was an essential design feature

376
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,779
to optimize for the privacy of the

377
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,589
system the systems only to be used for

378
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,079
exposure notifications by public health

379
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,819
authorities and it's not going to be

380
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:43,769
monetized though hopefully this would go

381
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,060
without saying but you know it's worth

382
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,850
saying explicitly our intention here was

383
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,399
to be very very rigorous and very strict

384
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,339
in only allowing these api is to be

385
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,100
called based on recognized authorized

386
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,110
public health authorities who are

387
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,050
designing apps for this specific purpose

388
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,189
and of course none of this information

389
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,230
is going to be used for anything that

390
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,849
makes any revenue for Google or for

391
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,089
Apple finally for this slide Google and

392
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,970
Apple we intend to disable this exposure

393
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,000
notifications on a regional basis when

394
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,039
it's no longer needed so we will remain

395
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,230
in close partnership with the national

396
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,179
health authorities and when the

397
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,699
president crisis has passed and we do

398
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,559
not feel this technology as necessary

399
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,959
anymore to contain coded 19 we intend to

400
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,600
shut it down next slide please now in

401
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,669
furtherance of that relationship with

402
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,710
public health authorities we've really

403
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,870
put a lot of thought into the policies

404
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,179
of procedures that will govern the way

405
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,770
that these api's will be made available

406
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,060
and how they can be used users as I said

407
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,120
or they have to explicitly consent to

408
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,940
turning on exposure notifications they

409
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,860
also will only be consenting for

410
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,050
purposes of these specific apps that are

411
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,960
created by or for government public

412
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,970
health authorities and the use of the

413
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,040
data that source by these api's is

414
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,780
strictly limited to be used for coded

415
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,140
19:00 response efforts as I had said

416
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,080
these apps must require the consent for

417
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,600
users before the app can use exposure

418
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,120
notification users are choosing to

419
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,790
download these apps themselves and once

420
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,740
the apps are installed they have to

421
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,630
operate within these restrict

422
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,220
constraints that are been defined for

423
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,610
them again even after the app has been

424
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,220
installed the app has to require users

425
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,340
to consent before sharing a positive

426
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,520
test result and as part of that that

427
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,650
notification sharing the Associated keys

428
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,870
with their device back to the Public

429
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,380
Health Authority there's a privacy by

430
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,300
design principle that's at the core of

431
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,940
this technology and we're requiring that

432
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,250
apps only collect the minimum amount of

433
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,950
data necessary and only use that data

434
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,800
for their code 19 response efforts all

435
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,530
other uses of that data including for

436
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,720
things like targeted advertising or

437
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,860
anything else that was intended to

438
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,260
generate revenue are strictly prohibited

439
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,060
and will not be allowed as part of this

440
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,620
technology's kind of use in deployment

441
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,780
one really important point to emphasize

442
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,110
is that we are prohibiting apps from

443
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,690
seeking permission to access location

444
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,060
services and again there was that early

445
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,280
design decision as to whether location

446
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,400
information would be necessary

447
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,990
for exposure notification we have

448
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,510
instead decided to focus on Bluetooth

449
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,910
proximity and we are prohibiting apps

450
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,370
from seeking permission to also access

451
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,250
location service information from the

452
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,650
device and appending it to the Bluetooth

453
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,120
proximity data order any kind of

454
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,660
identity information then finally the

455
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,610
use of these API is actually going to be

456
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,160
restricted to one app per country a

457
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,780
country is a little misleading we

458
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,120
actually mean as per jurisdiction per

459
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,460
Health

460
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,120
authority this is to promote a high user

461
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,660
adoption and avoid fragmentation we want

462
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,700
to do everything that we can to optimize

463
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,790
this entire system or trust we recognize

464
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,470
that people are going to be reasonably

465
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,750
skeptical before installing an

466
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,520
application it's going to be doing these

467
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,900
things so we want to make sure that we

468
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,970
are creating the simplest possible

469
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,370
framework subject to these really

470
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,340
rigorous and very strict constraints and

471
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,930
then we want to put national health

472
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,300
authorities in the driver's seat in

473
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,910
terms of controlling which app is going

474
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,530
to be approved within their jurisdiction

475
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,900
and some of the ways that app is going

476
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,880
to operate as to users that are

477
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,400
operating within that region so we want

478
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,160
to minimize the number of apps with a

479
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,770
minimum rational number for the number

480
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,970
of health authorities that we're dealing

481
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,430
with to maximize adoption and make this

482
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,750
deployment as useful

483
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,880
excellent well thank you both and that

484
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,740
was a really great explanation and I

485
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,140
appreciated the the sort of focus on the

486
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,090
design choices but let's let's take a

487
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,680
little deeper there because we we're

488
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,240
talking to a set of privacy

489
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,620
professionals so maybe some of the

490
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,620
tactics around that actual process of

491
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,950
design right not only to meet the need

492
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,730
from a public health standpoint but also

493
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,530
the design from a privacy standpoint so

494
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm thinking of things like um who

495
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,390
helped you figure out that like six feet

496
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,760
would be the right distance to determine

497
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,110
whether there's going to be an infection

498
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,780
and how did you think about that in

499
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,240
terms of putting the design on the table

500
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,430
and talk more about the difference

501
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,990
between location which I think has been

502
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,530
historically the way contact tracing as

503
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,250
a mental model thought about it versus

504
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,610
like the proximity distancing so like

505
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,750
maybe talk a little bit about that

506
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,510
design process and did they start

507
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,680
separately in each of your companies and

508
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,510
then you converged or did you go gather

509
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:01,390
together at the same time so to answer

510
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,450
the last question first I think we had

511
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,580
all we've been in a lot and it also and

512
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,060
she's the first basically we were in

513
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,500
contact with the public health

514
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,150
authorities early on and as Keith said

515
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,400
in his room

516
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,500
both companies wanted to see what we

517
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,540
could do to help out with the pandemic

518
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,780
and we have been in discussions with a

519
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,060
lot of health authorities that were

520
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,140
early early considering the expose

521
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,420
contact tracing and whether cellphones

522
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,230
could be helpful we you know recognize

523
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,470
that we are we are not experts and we do

524
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,830
have experts on staff both companies

525
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,750
have medical doctors on staff that work

526
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,120
on our health project so they were very

527
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,340
very influential in the design we also

528
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,580
reached out to the CDC European

529
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,420
authorities data protection we briefed

530
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,840
the Irish and the UK and data protection

531
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,450
authorities throughout Europe and the

532
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,210
APAC region very early on to talk to

533
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,780
them about the privacy features and it's

534
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,150
really been trying to figure out how to

535
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,750
balance what we want to be a very

536
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,480
private technology but still make it

537
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,670
useful and you know there have been a

538
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,650
number of different press reports that

539
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,480
are challenging whether we are to

540
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,080
private which is is an interesting place

541
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,870
to be but you know the other thing that

542
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,970
needs to be considered if we are less

543
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,440
private and I think we're seeing that

544
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,990
play out right now if we're less private

545
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,600
less people will download the app so you

546
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,150
have to reach the right balance between

547
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,470
privacy and effectiveness so hopefully

548
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,780
we'll get a big uptake in people using

549
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,340
it and keep I'm sure you have more to

550
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,100
add yeah I agree with all that I think a

551
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,670
couple things that I would buy one is

552
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,680
clearly we recognized coming out of the

553
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,230
gate here that we are not a company

554
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,660
whose core competency is epidemiology or

555
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,540
virology so I think I think we approach

556
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,740
this with an appropriate level of

557
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,170
humility we had leading researchers from

558
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,810
medical schools around the world coming

559
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,790
to us it was a really interesting moment

560
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,150
where we had this unsolicited but

561
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,610
serendipitous engagement from leading

562
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,070
thinkers across all fields that were

563
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,570
relevant to what we were what we were

564
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,180
thinking through we had some of the

565
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,710
world's leading cryptographers come out

566
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,360
to us for sharing their research

567
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,950
sharing their thinking saying we think

568
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,380
that there is a way that you might be

569
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,970
able to help but we would like to share

570
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,650
our research and share our perspective

571
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,150
so that you're doing it in the most

572
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,929
secure

573
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:39,299
anonymized fashion possible so there

574
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,710
were these tremendous dialogues between

575
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,990
the Google research team the Apple

576
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,720
engineering team the various academics

577
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
around the world where we were kind of

578
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,380
checking challenging some of the

579
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,600
assumptions that's been interesting and

580
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,580
fascinating the other point that kind of

581
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,100
I want to push a little bit from what

582
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,460
Jane had said is I I think we are

583
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,740
confident that what we are trying to do

584
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,740
here will be helpful but again we need

585
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,299
to approach what comes next with an

586
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,190
appropriate level of humility right we

587
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,870
are we are moving in somewhat uncharted

588
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,750
waters we are trying to apply the

589
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,210
benefits of technology to a

590
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,669
well-established to drift to traditional

591
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:23,910
methodology of contact tracing and we

592
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,830
will adjust course as we go we will

593
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,059
improve as we learn but there are there

594
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,200
were all sorts of decision points along

595
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,059
the way one that I want to make sure we

596
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,299
don't presume is that privacy and

597
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,950
efficacy have actually been in tension

598
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,130
because nothing I have seen to date

599
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,600
supports the proposition that privacy

600
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,290
and efficacy are going to be in tension

601
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,429
Jane is exactly right that penetration

602
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,929
ubiquitous adoption all of that those

603
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:54,120
are presumptively going to be really

604
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,669
important in this being effective but

605
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm also seeing research suggesting that

606
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,710
even with relatively low adoption rates

607
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,000
contact tracing and by extension

608
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,010
exposure notification might have

609
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,809
substantial public health benefits

610
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:09,270
there's a great deal that we don't know

611
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,100
and I think we are going to be learning

612
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,169
right alongside the public health

613
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,330
community and others as we go along

614
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,740
through this journey and continue

615
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,490
optimizing our approach to try it it

616
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,160
seems like one of the defining

617
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,370
differentiators for for your API versus

618
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,040
other models is is centralized versus

619
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,770
decentralized matching and it helped me

620
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,270
out because I'm not sure I totally

621
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,500
understand each each one involves some

622
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,510
centralized server but but for the

623
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,100
Google Apple one its

624
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,140
it's like the limitation of matching is

625
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,200
really about hosting positive cases that

626
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,059
are consented to put be put into that

627
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,330
centralized server right versus tell me

628
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,280
more about what the other model is like

629
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,780
is it that other public health

630
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,190
authorities who decide they want a

631
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,919
centralized server have more information

632
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,640
about the user and maybe talk a little

633
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,280
bit about the pros and cons there so

634
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,250
with the centralized approach if we look

635
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,400
back to Bob and Alice in our schematic

636
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,640
as Bob and Alice are sitting on the park

637
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,159
bench with a centralized approach those

638
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,890
exposures are being sent up to a central

639
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,250
server to mediate regardless of whether

640
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,789
either Bob or Alice had koban there

641
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:28,500
would be a server that was just

642
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,750
essentially keeping contact keeping

643
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,669
track of all the people that you had

644
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:35,130
come into contact with and could

645
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,980
potentially have been exposed to so then

646
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,620
when Bob subsequently gets diagnosed

647
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,620
with Kovac the centralized server will

648
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,140
do the matching and then send down a

649
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,140
notification to Alice that she may have

650
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,900
been exposed and and generally in a

651
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,690
centralized approach they could or may

652
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,730
know the identities of the people that

653
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,909
are exposed there's more and I think

654
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:04,289
there have been there's been a lot of

655
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,090
work on the centralized approach to

656
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,370
minimize the privacy impact as well to

657
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,270
be quite fair on on our approach there

658
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,640
are keys that are sent up to the server

659
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,610
but they are sent up to the server only

660
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,669
on consent of Bob because remember bob

661
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,590
was the one that had the positive

662
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,960
diagnosis he worked with the public

663
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,480
health authorities at the point that he

664
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,820
wanted to notify the people that he had

665
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,250
come into contact with he made the

666
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,640
decision to send those keys up and so

667
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,490
there's a lot more control and Trust put

668
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,530
in the individual and the exposure

669
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,580
notifications model but because we you

670
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,370
know we think if you give people

671
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,169
transparency and control they will do

672
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:52,559
the right thing that is why we went with

673
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,860
the model that we

674
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,540
went with because the centralized model

675
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,340
does have the potential and I'm not

676
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,740
saying that it always does to build a

677
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,450
social graph of everybody you've been in

678
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,690
contact with yeah as Jane acknowledges

679
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,520
one of the things that struck me across

680
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,210
the course of the project was they were

681
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,970
very thoughtful very reasonable privacy

682
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,570
conscious people on the other side of

683
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,880
this debate around centralized versus

684
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,059
decentralized and they sincerely sort of

685
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:25,299
believe that there are performance

686
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,100
benefits for the centralized model of

687
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,669
having access to more information by the

688
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,400
Federal Health Authority we'll do

689
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,140
certain things more effectively we

690
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,540
didn't see evidence of that and when we

691
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,270
weighed the potential privacy risks of

692
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,900
the data being repurposed to assemble so

693
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,390
a contact graph that we thought was a

694
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,450
potentially sort of significant privacy

695
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,700
risk that we wanted to mitigate and from

696
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,410
everything that we saw we felt like we

697
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,510
could deliver all of the efficacy

698
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,580
benefits of the model by at the

699
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,290
distributed system where that processing

700
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,940
with some device is opposed by a

701
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,190
centralized server we we committed to

702
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,740
the course of decentralization and at

703
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,750
this point it feels like that's where

704
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,940
the center of gravity is you know the

705
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,620
debate continues to shift and they're

706
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,059
still alive the external discussion

707
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,429
there are envelope jurisdictions that

708
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,340
remain to pursuing the centralized

709
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,520
approach but most jurisdictions are now

710
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,960
leaning towards the decentralized

711
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,669
approach and are signing on with our API

712
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,460
which you know we're taking as a signal

713
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,929
of validation that you know we're

714
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,030
weighing the equities and the privacy

715
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,350
risks here really that's great I think

716
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,910
you both gestured to some of the like

717
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,030
limitations that might come with this

718
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,760
right so one of them is just smartphone

719
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,850
penetration might limit how many people

720
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,429
actually adopt this there could be bias

721
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,590
in the population of who has smartphones

722
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,480
I think that the most recent data is

723
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,059
like really old people and low-income

724
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,290
people have are less likely to have a

725
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,000
smartphone not by huge ones but like 10

726
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,650
to 12 percent I think less than the

727
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,540
general population so those are actually

728
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,850
as it turns out the most vulnerable of

729
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,510
the puppies

730
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,030
shins for COBIT so that's that's an

731
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,610
important thing to think about but it

732
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,410
also strikes me that like and this is

733
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,450
putting a little bit of my public policy

734
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,660
hat on right one of the biggest

735
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,800
limitations may be the technical

736
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,660
capacity of any given public health

737
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,500
authority to know how to it because as I

738
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,660
understand it you're gonna put them

739
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,950
through some sort of verification

740
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,860
criteria and let's put a pin in that and

741
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,240
talk about what that criteria will look

742
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,630
like but also they have to actually

743
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,980
develop the app host the data maintain

744
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,900
it and then follow up with the tracing

745
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,020
which is a lot for at least in our

746
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,140
country and to ask public health

747
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,450
authorities who have been many of which

748
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,230
have been defunded over decades so could

749
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,930
you talk a little bit about like let's

750
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,280
go to like the public health authorities

751
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,400
that you've met with the criteria you

752
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,230
you think about when when deciding

753
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,830
whether to license the API to them and

754
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,590
some of the challenges they may face

755
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,360
taking on the framework so on that on

756
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,130
the subject of the public health

757
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,610
authorities and how we decide we have a

758
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,100
special review group that's looking at

759
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,200
these applications by public health

760
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,530
authorities and you know we want to make

761
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,450
sure there they are the public health

762
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,780
authority for the region one of the

763
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,400
things that is still being discussed

764
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,530
across the globe when people are looking

765
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,860
at using exposure notifications is as as

766
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,680
Keith focused the exposure notification

767
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,410
will be able to be used by one country

768
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,110
or one region but there can be multiple

769
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:55,060
entities in a region using the en API so

770
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,300
figuring out who the authorized Public

771
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,660
Health Authority is and again it's a lot

772
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,170
of outreach it's a lot of discussions

773
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,870
and in talking and putting you know our

774
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,970
technologists on on the phone with

775
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,570
public health authorities to help them

776
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,000
discussing some of these issues you know

777
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,350
we've been trying to be as helpful as

778
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,000
possible recognizing that we are not

779
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,980
Public Health

780
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,090
experts yeah agree with all that they

781
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,220
think responding to the front half of

782
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,340
your question to call there are an array

783
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,190
of public policy challenges associated

784
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,710
with this many of which I've come to

785
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,030
understand better than I ever expected

786
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,190
to and still don't understand half as

787
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,220
well as I should sadly we are not well

788
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,650
positioned to solve right like many of

789
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,960
the challenges around disproportionately

790
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,330
affected populations and access to

791
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,700
technology and access to connectivity I

792
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,400
think there's a lot there what we are

793
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,299
focusing on is making the api's as

794
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,990
effective and as safe and as privacy

795
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,450
productive as possible and then working

796
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,470
with the public health authorities to

797
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,260
support them in implementing the api's

798
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,219
in whatever app I think they're learning

799
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,869
from each other as well like we're

800
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,040
seeing a great deal of interaction

801
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,810
Public Health Authority to Public Health

802
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,418
Authority which is encouraging and

803
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:23,310
hopefully that will also have knock-on

804
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,590
effects across governments generally

805
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,109
which may you know shine light on some

806
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,570
of the other adjacent issues that I

807
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,710
think they're going to need to think

808
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,659
about to maximize the effectiveness of

809
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,060
the work but in the short term medium

810
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,080
term getting the api's sort of optimized

811
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,869
getting them deployed as widely as

812
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,359
possible in apps that are functioning as

813
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,550
intended in as many jurisdictions around

814
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,350
the world as possible and then focusing

815
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,210
on promotion and adoption I do think

816
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,489
there is a significant impediment to

817
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:56,820
this which is making the message simple

818
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,619
enough and compelling enough and

819
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,050
transparent enough that users can make

820
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,240
an informed decision saying I want to

821
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,800
install this because it is the right

822
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,869
thing for me and for my family and for

823
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,210
my neighbors and for my society for the

824
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,590
people around me and this is actually

825
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,359
going to reduce a material risk

826
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,520
that's a hard lift right like holding

827
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,050
people's attention long enough and

828
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,460
communicating all of the essential

829
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,500
information don't help them feel like

830
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,450
they're making a fully informed choice

831
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,970
to install this app to enable the app

832
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,940
and then to subsequently consent to to

833
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,100
exposure notification there's a lot to

834
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,200
do there and we're focusing right now on

835
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
working with National Health Authority

836
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,250
to them to do that bit as effectively as

837
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,280
they possibly can if we can do that

838
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,710
which is a substantial if that I think a

839
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,630
lot of these significant adjacent

840
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,190
problems will come into focus and then

841
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,390
folks can begin diverting their

842
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,710
attention there's at least one maybe two

843
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,910
bills in in the federal Congress on data

844
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,770
collected in the process of the coded

845
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,530
response and I think certainly in Europe

846
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,540
a lot of the data protection authorities

847
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,040
you know issuing guidance about how do

848
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,230
we start collecting data particularly in

849
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,540
workplaces about kovat exposure is there

850
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,670
something into either of your minds that

851
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,780
public policymakers ought to be doing to

852
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,320
make this better clearer more protective

853
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,690
what what are you seeing out there that

854
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,700
feels like the right thing to make this

855
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,030
go faster I think you know one of the

856
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,400
things this points out is the fact that

857
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,620
the US doesn't have an omnibus privacy

858
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,110
law yet and that's something that we've

859
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,940
been very supportive of I think within

860
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,850
Europe we see the Commission the

861
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,860
European data protection board and the

862
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,960
DPA is all working within the framework

863
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
of gdpr and so there are guidelines

864
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,110
there that are hopefully giving more

865
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,290
consumer trust and I think within the US

866
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,400
and one of the reasons we're seeing

867
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,880
bills in the US is because the the real

868
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,320
thing that's going to help in in making

869
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,290
this work is consumer trust and people

870
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,450
are worried about secondary uses of data

871
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,520
and as Keith made clear Apple and Google

872
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,830
don't have the data the data will be

873
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,690
sent up the public to the public health

874
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,450
authorities and there are state laws and

875
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,180
health laws that will cover some of this

876
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,940
but you know I think that the main goal

877
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,510
here is to give consumer trust and agree

878
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,280
with what Jane is saying one other thing

879
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,050
that I would emphasize is we talked

880
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,350
about COBIT privacy specific legislation

881
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,630
and how that dovetails with this notion

882
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,970
of a much needed general federal omnibus

883
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,130
privacy law it's important that we don't

884
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,960
lose sight of the fact that here at

885
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,930
issue it's primarily government agencies

886
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,760
gaining access

887
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,950
certain types of information so we need

888
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,240
to make sure that whatever privacy

889
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,250
protections we're providing our privacy

890
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,440
protections as to government entities

891
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,510
like this is not a situation we're

892
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,250
actually talking about substantially

893
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,609
creating a new privacy risk from private

894
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:02,890
sector companies this is something where

895
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,060
we need to make sure protections are

896
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,550
being expansively applied so the users

897
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,810
are getting strong rights and

898
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,550
protections relative to government

899
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,730
access and user data in our last couple

900
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,890
of minutes is there is there another

901
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,320
phase to this project for you I like

902
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,790
seeing you guys work together I missed

903
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:23,470
that and and what else what other any

904
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,630
other innovations that you either of

905
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,090
your companies are planning or any other

906
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,359
last thoughts on this issue well I mean

907
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,790
I think the the as we've made really

908
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,170
clear we're talking about public health

909
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,600
authorities a lot and there are

910
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,940
different needs across the world and so

911
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,380
we're looking at different

912
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,330
recommendations taking in a lot of

913
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,119
feedback discussing ways to address

914
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,840
different issues so we are still

915
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,340
developing Keith and I are still

916
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,570
coordinating quite a bit and but I don't

917
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,550
think though I don't see any change in

918
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,950
the core privacy commitments we've made

919
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,869
the technology may evolve yeah I mean

920
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:06,670
that going to have I have been supremely

921
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,380
grateful or the privilege and

922
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,910
opportunity to work with Jane again

923
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,380
she's been a friend and mentor for a

924
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,430
very very long time so great this is

925
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,100
this crisis has presented us with

926
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,930
opportunities to sort of think top to

927
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,760
bottom about different ways that we can

928
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,240
help solve some of these societal

929
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,619
problems in ways that our privacy

930
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:28,300
protective I mentioned at the beginning

931
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,310
that one of the initial initial

932
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,800
approaches was how location data might

933
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,960
be useful in responding to this crisis

934
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,450
and our initial reaction was not the

935
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,609
right data no privacy risks were

936
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:41,410
overwhelming we actually had teams in

937
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,390
parallel with this spinning on that

938
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,040
particular problem which resulted in

939
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,690
something we called the mobility

940
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,210
mobility reports where we took

941
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,270
anonymized aggregated data sets and made

942
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,859
them available to public health

943
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,660
authorities in different contexts which

944
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,940
allowed them to do things like interpret

945
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,550
the

946
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,010
patterns to hospitals so that they could

947
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,270
understand like we're were they're

948
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,130
actually actually seeing traffic spikes

949
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,260
how can they be allocating some finite

950
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,240
Public Health resources in a way to

951
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,400
deliver maximum benefit the fact that we

952
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,080
have the ability to do that in a more

953
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,700
privacy protective way than was ever

954
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,100
possible before just another example of

955
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,600
the way this sort of thing can drive

956
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,250
innovation that can drive positive

957
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,820
outcomes great well this has been

958
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,320
wonderful for me to have an opportunity

959
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,390
to hang out with both of you again um

960
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,390
and so just in closing for you and your

961
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,820
families stay healthy and well you as

962
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,710
well thanks so much thank you

963
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:53,949
