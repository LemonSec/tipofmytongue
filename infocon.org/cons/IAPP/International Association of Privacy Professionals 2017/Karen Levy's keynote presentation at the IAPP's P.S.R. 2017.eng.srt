1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,940
please welcome our next speaker Cornell

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,189
University's dr. Karen lady

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,050
hi everyone nice to join you all today

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,560
hi it's great to be with you all today

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,330
thanks so much for inviting me to come

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,710
speak with you

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,990
it looks like a great amazing line-up of

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,400
programming you all have for the next

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,689
few days and I'm really honored that you

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,949
let me come be a part of it

11
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:36,500
so I am a professor at Cornell

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,850
University I'm a lawyer and a

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,890
sociologist but more sociologists a

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,769
lawyer and I study surveillance and

15
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:45,379
privacy and I study surveillance in a

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,440
variety of settings but there's a common

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,299
thread that I've kind of accidentally

18
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,949
discovered that seems to run through

19
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:54,769
everything that I do which I didn't set

20
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,449
out to do research about this but it

21
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:57,710
seems like it just keeps coming back to

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,900
me and I thought I would talk with you

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,670
about it today and that common thread is

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,570
intimacy so surveillance is bound up

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,100
with our intimate lives in a bunch of

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,990
different ways and I thought I would

27
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,689
tell you three short stories today from

28
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,280
my research from different projects I'm

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,350
working on about different ways that

30
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,869
intimacy emerges in relation to data and

31
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,250
surveillance so first I thought I would

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,130
talk to you about care some work that

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,869
I'm doing with a collaborator about

34
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,880
surveillance in homes and in families

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,109
which I know is something that many of

36
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,270
you think about a lot then I thought I'd

37
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,530
talk with you about surveillance and

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,749
bodies in relation to some research I'm

39
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,399
doing about workplace surveillance

40
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:35,929
especially with long-haul truck drivers

41
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,810
and automation in that industry and then

42
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,979
finally I want to talk with you a little

43
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,259
bit about violence and some research I'm

44
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,649
doing about intimacy and abuse so let's

45
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,240
start with care that's kind of the most

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,880
fun one probably in some of my work

47
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,679
we've been looking at how surveillance

48
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,380
products are marketed to consumers for

49
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,909
surveillance of people in their own

50
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,039
homes and their families and their

51
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,049
romantic relationships in the intimate

52
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,179
spheres of their lives and these are

53
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:03,619
tools that many of you are familiar with

54
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,149
right things like in-home camera and

55
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,419
security systems baby monitors fertility

56
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,758
trackers location trackers for kids for

57
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,390
teenagers a lot of the new IOT devices

58
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,560
that many of the big tech companies are

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,690
putting out these products are all

60
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,459
things you can buy on Amazon they range

61
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,280
in price from about $40 to about $400

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,230
and can you guess what they all have in

63
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,520
common they're all cameras

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,050
they're all hidden cameras they're just

65
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,150
cameras in different decoy type shapes

66
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,180
so these types of things this on the

67
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,180
right is the sprouting that's one of

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,560
many there's a bunch of different kind

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,000
of products in this space but this is an

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,460
ankle monitor for an infant and it

71
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,170
monitors an infant's heart rate

72
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,150
temperature the ambient light and sound

73
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,320
in the room there's a bunch of different

74
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,550
products that monitor different stuff

75
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,340
about babies and that of course like

76
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,420
what we tend to think of when we think

77
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,890
of an ankle bracelet is the one on the

78
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,270
left right and so what we're suggesting

79
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,580
in some of this work that we're doing is

80
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,440
that actually more and more surveillance

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
is looking like the ankle monitor on the

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,750
right right and and the interpretation

83
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,250
we have of that is that surveillance is

84
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,170
becoming a really normalized mode of

85
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,630
taking care of one another right not

86
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,340
necessarily always punitive sometimes

87
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,350
based in care and there's a lot of this

88
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,810
I found really interesting because in

89
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,290
the privacy research sphere there's a

90
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,420
lot of emphasis on how a bunch of data

91
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,070
is being collected about all of us right

92
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,020
how we're all being watched but there's

93
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,820
less emphasis on this other dynamic

94
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,500
which is how we're all becoming Watchers

95
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,990
and that is what's for sale with

96
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,390
products like this right so the idea is

97
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,010
that surveillance is becoming

98
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,950
normatively essential really required to

99
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,200
the duties of care that you have across

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,820
the lifecycle right whether that's just

101
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,490
your role as a parent as a child as a

102
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,220
spouse and if you look at the rhetorics

103
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,900
that get mark get used to market the

104
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,520
stuff all of the rhetoric all of the

105
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,560
advertising language is about love and

106
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,310
care and protection and safety and duty

107
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,230
right we watch because we care you watch

108
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,690
out over your baby and we as a tech

109
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,130
company will help you do that you can

110
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,170
offload some of that burden of care onto

111
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,630
us and using that product reflects on

112
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,220
you in the relationship that you have

113
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,190
with say a child and this extends all

114
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,690
across the lifecycle right so I showed

115
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,220
you some stuff about babies there's feed

116
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,560
a lot of fetal monitoring that's kind of

117
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,750
you can read in the same sphere all the

118
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,310
way up to elderly adults so I have some

119
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,140
other work about about monitoring a load

120
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,320
elderly people now for someone who

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,570
studies surveillance like me I find this

122
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,100
to be one of the most interesting and

123
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,500
normatively difficult areas I have two

124
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,700
young children I have a two year old in

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,200
the four year old and I totally

126
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,270
understand the impetus to monitor them

127
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,590
right to collect data about them I'm

128
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,910
sure I will in different ways as they

129
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,680
grow up and they

130
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,180
driving and texting and doing all kinds

131
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,350
of stuff I probably don't want them to

132
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,630
do and I'm not suggesting that this

133
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,970
interest or this this desire to monitor

134
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,039
is misplaced or that these tools can

135
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,160
actually do a lot of good for families

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,270
but what I think is important to note

137
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,880
about these is this - cell protection

138
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,100
and care you also have to create a

139
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,289
reciprocal anxiety you have to sell an

140
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,180
anxiety about what you're being

141
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,710
protected from and so this is what

142
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,000
happens if you look at this marketing

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,009
this marketing cultivates a generalized

144
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,500
anxiety about the big bad world of

145
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,780
threats and some of those threats are

146
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,430
external things like worrying that your

147
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,720
house is going to be robbed or that

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,099
you're going to be assaulted and some of

149
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,360
them are internal that your baby has

150
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,830
some illness that you won't know about

151
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,410
unless you buy this device and actually

152
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,449
this is an old advertising trick so

153
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,099
we're what's for sale is not just

154
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,500
comfort but also the discomfort that's

155
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,780
relieved by the product that you buy the

156
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,190
packaging of discomfort and comfort

157
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,080
together so we tend to buy pain the

158
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,360
first example of us that I know of was

159
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,669
the toothpaste Pepsodent which was an

160
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:39,780
old tooth I don't actually know if they

161
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,340
even sell Pepsodent anymore but when

162
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,810
they started selling pepsin it was one

163
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,639
of the most successful early toothpastes

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,770
and the reason why is not because it

165
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,360
cleans your teeth any better than the

166
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,310
other toothpaste on the market but

167
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,099
because it hurt to use like it made your

168
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:53,550
mouth

169
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,990
I think sting I think it was like really

170
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,659
really minty or something so people

171
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,220
thought it was doing a better job than

172
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,440
the others right it created this pain

173
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,960
and then it made people believe that it

174
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
was really working right you package the

175
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,729
pain and and the relief together the

176
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:09,659
other thing that I find interesting

177
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,130
about these tools is that there's kind

178
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,080
of a backward compatibility to the way

179
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,690
we talk about surveillance in care so

180
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,759
increasingly we see companies and states

181
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,280
using this language of love and care to

182
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,289
justify their own surveillance so this

183
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,820
comes from a public university a friend

184
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,380
of mine took this right but there's a

185
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,479
bunch of examples of this of states

186
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,090
using this language of care okay so

187
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,889
that's this first little tidbit the

188
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,449
second little snapshot I thought I would

189
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,370
share with you has to do with some of my

190
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,050
long stay for me long-standing research

191
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,990
about workplace surveillance so I'm sure

192
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,340
you have all heard because you're all

193
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,990
educated people concerned about

194
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,240
technology but there's a lot of

195
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,039
well-founded concern lately about the

196
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,469
possibility that AI is going to bring

197
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,270
about massive disruption and employment

198
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,039
right that millions of workers are

199
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,440
suddenly

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,420
I lose their jobs they wanted the

201
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,340
ability to ache to make ends meet and

202
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,810
there's a bunch of discussion about

203
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,220
what's the extent of the disruption

204
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,530
gonna be what sorts of jobs face the

205
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,770
greatest threat now one of the prime

206
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,050
targets everybody seems to agree is

207
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,600
likely to be long-haul truck driving and

208
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,610
there are several reasons for this some

209
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,960
of them are technical right there's been

210
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,970
a lot of technical innovation in the

211
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,610
sphere of autonomous vehicles lately

212
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,660
autonomous vehicles are best at highway

213
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,910
driving which trucks do a lot of but

214
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,170
then there's also some other factors

215
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,460
which I explore a lot in my research

216
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,600
which have to do with the fact that

217
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,250
truck drivers are often varied they're

218
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,840
really overworked and they're really

219
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,030
tired based on the political economy of

220
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,830
the industry and so they get really

221
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,240
tired and they get in these expensive

222
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,580
and deadly accidents and machines don't

223
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,930
right machines don't get tired so

224
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,490
there's there's some kind of a push

225
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,220
factor there too now economists worry a

226
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,080
lot about this this economic impact

227
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,040
right there are about two million

228
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
long-haul truckers in the United States

229
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,100
I don't know if any of you have seen

230
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,750
this graphic NPR put this out about a

231
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,060
year ago this is showing the most common

232
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,490
job in every state and all of those kind

233
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,720
of act like the biggest one although

234
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,970
aqua colored states the most common job

235
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,500
in that state is truck driver and so the

236
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,570
common rhetoric they've like very common

237
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,160
concern about this now is what happens

238
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,640
if all of those jobs are lost you know I

239
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,250
spent the last six years studying the

240
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,390
role of Technology in truck driving

241
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,740
that's what I wrote my dissertation

242
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,020
about and I'm working on a book about it

243
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,390
now actually and there is a threat from

244
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,520
automation there to be sure but I

245
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,440
believe that the rhetoric about massive

246
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,780
job loss doesn't capture the whole

247
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,660
nature of the threat okay so I don't

248
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,030
think we're gonna see this discrete

249
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,340
phase transition from humans to robots

250
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,080
in the trucking workplace right it's not

251
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,880
like it goes human human human robot

252
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,950
right that's not how it works instead

253
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,419
it's gonna be this much more gradual

254
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,330
curve right because being a truck driver

255
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,589
actually involves a whole lot of things

256
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,479
that aren't just driving right you have

257
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,580
to interface with customers you have to

258
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,990
secure your load you have to make

259
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,760
repairs you have to load Freight all

260
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,010
kinds of stuff that's harder to automate

261
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,350
right than highway driving and hence

262
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,210
might be automatable someday but it's

263
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,440
gonna come later right the idea is that

264
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,910
it's not likely that we won't have truck

265
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,770
drivers at all but it is likely that the

266
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,100
nature of truck driving will change and

267
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,819
probably what will

268
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,859
that will require human truck drivers

269
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:11,079
human workers to integrate their work

270
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,789
with the technology in new ways

271
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,769
now we sometimes think about this a lot

272
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:15,970
of people in our town amidst vehicles

273
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,229
think about this is what they call the

274
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,939
handoff problem right that humans and

275
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,339
machines pass the baton back and forth

276
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,589
basically and we kind of discreetly

277
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,359
parcel out which functions the humans

278
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,799
good at and which function the robots

279
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,109
good at but we actually see happening

280
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,759
and trucking today is not a discrete

281
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,600
parceling out instead what we see is the

282
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,669
integration of the human and the robot

283
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:38,619
into one another in a very physical way

284
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,839
so in practice the way workers are

285
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,879
actually experiencing the rise of AI and

286
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,589
trucking right now isn't this

287
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,199
displacement but is this very gradual

288
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,209
physical intrusion into their work in

289
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,850
their bodies now this is a cartoon from

290
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,350
a trucker magazine I never thought I was

291
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,119
going to spend a bunch of time reading

292
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:57,339
trucker magazines but there you go I do

293
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,419
that now so this is a robo trucker and

294
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,639
this article is about in the trucker

295
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,319
magazine is about some of these systems

296
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,669
right now I'm gonna tell you about a few

297
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:07,989
of the examples that come up in this

298
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:09,729
article and in some other some of my

299
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,639
other work so Mercedes recently

300
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,929
announced that they're working on a vest

301
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:16,419
for truck drivers that they wear and it

302
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:17,919
monitors their heart rate and their

303
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,559
other vital signs and the idea is that

304
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,419
the vest knows if the trucker is gonna

305
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,609
have a heart attack and if so it stops

306
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:27,549
the truck automatically this is a

307
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:29,169
company called seeing machines it's one

308
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,509
of kind of several companies that do use

309
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,549
driver facing cameras to monitor signs

310
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,100
of fatigue now seeing machines does this

311
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,989
by monitoring a driver's eyelids looking

312
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,459
at the movement of a driver's eyelids

313
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,889
and the the direction of his eyes and if

314
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,569
his eyes closed or he looks away from

315
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,279
the road it'll send an alert to his boss

316
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,799
it gets logged on his record and this is

317
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,749
my favorite part it'll cause the

318
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,459
driver's seat to vibrate too kind of

319
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,269
like goose him back into attention it's

320
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,949
it's true

321
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,779
the in strivers are wearing the smart

322
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:00,909
cap which is meant to detect fatigue by

323
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,679
monitoring a drivers brainwaves so it's

324
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,869
basically doing an EEG and if you get

325
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,850
tired it can sound an alarm it will text

326
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,229
your manager it can also be programmed

327
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:10,629
to text your family members so there are

328
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,309
other systems to right some companies

329
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,319
use predictive analytics to determine a

330
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,669
driver's likelihood of being involved in

331
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:18,369
a crash using not only driving data but

332
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:19,509
other information about what's happening

333
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:20,170
in is

334
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,600
life like if he got a pay change or he

335
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,860
started driving at a different time in

336
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,519
the morning lately things like that so

337
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,930
the key point I want to make about this

338
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,510
is the distance between these two types

339
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,070
of thread right and I think both are

340
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,440
real threats but we tend to hear this

341
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,850
narrative of displacement without

342
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,680
necessarily recognizing this other

343
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,290
threat of intrusion so the question of

344
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,910
displacement isn't the only important

345
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,290
thing to understand here we should also

346
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,449
think about how in this work the

347
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,000
intrusion of AI is very intimate and

348
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,579
very much about bodies right very much

349
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,050
about a truck drivers body it's this

350
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,810
forced hybridization that really changes

351
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,050
the nature of the work that remains okay

352
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,660
last little snapshot this is to the

353
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,920
extent I have a greatest hits this is

354
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,430
the greatest it's only three songs okay

355
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,750
the last thing I want to tell you about

356
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,579
is a newer project I'm working on an

357
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,139
interdisciplinary project I'm doing with

358
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,760
a bunch of researchers at Cornell where

359
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,060
I work now including an NYU including

360
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,769
some experts in cybersecurity and in

361
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,320
human-computer interaction and in this

362
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,610
project we're looking at the role of

363
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,820
Technology in intimate partner violence

364
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,899
now there are a lot of components to the

365
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,100
work we're doing they're a bunch of

366
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,120
researchers on the project but I'm just

367
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,170
gonna tell you about a little slice of

368
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,540
it so we know that intimate partner

369
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,399
violence is a really pervasive problem

370
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,560
faced by about 10 percent of men and

371
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,540
about a quarter of women in the United

372
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,730
States that have suffered rape physical

373
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,250
violence or stalking at the hands of an

374
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,290
intimate partner and we know also that

375
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,910
technology plays a really big and

376
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,800
growing role in this so in the course of

377
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,149
the last year we've been wrapping up a

378
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,949
study at intimate violence shelters in

379
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,440
New York City and we've learned a lot of

380
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,269
really depressing information about the

381
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:57,010
many ways that people use technology to

382
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,050
victimize other people with whom they

383
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,420
had or are having intimate relationships

384
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,490
and some of this has gotten some play in

385
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,510
the media and you're likely familiar

386
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,100
with some of the things like harassment

387
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,920
via social media the exposure of private

388
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,510
information or images things like

389
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,060
revenge porn and it's clear that victims

390
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,370
have a really hard time getting legal

391
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,139
action that addresses those problems for

392
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,120
them or getting platforms to help them

393
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,980
out but what I want to talk with you

394
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,870
about today is this other kind of aspect

395
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,459
of it that has become clear to us then

396
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,440
that I found really interesting which is

397
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,660
how different intimate partner violence

398
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,390
is from other types of privacy and

399
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,480
security threats that we

400
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
or commonly think about so there are a

401
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,810
lot of technologists that are becoming

402
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,940
really enthusiastic about intervening in

403
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,560
the context of domestic violence which

404
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,260
is great but there are some perils right

405
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,810
to treating intimate partner violence

406
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,040
like the other contexts in which we

407
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,320
think about privacy and security and

408
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,639
their unique ethical and design

409
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,889
challenges that arise when your threat

410
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,930
is intimate and physically co-present

411
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,910
and has access to your devices and has

412
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,829
access to your body so it's different

413
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:59,600
than these other contexts in which we

414
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,480
normally think of digital threats as

415
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,209
physically remote usually so we need a

416
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,649
kind of threat model differently in this

417
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:07,850
case that's kind of the work we're doing

418
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,779
and I want to highlight a few

419
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,579
distinctions between intimate partner

420
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:13,279
violence in other contexts the first is

421
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,779
what we sometimes call the peril of the

422
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,480
blank slate so often in privacy and

423
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,760
security if your integrity has been

424
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,380
compromised a pretty straightforward of

425
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,389
advice is will close your account right

426
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,850
reopen a new one cut up your credit card

427
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,519
change your password take some steps to

428
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,199
disconnect or to insulate yourself from

429
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,070
the invasion but in the context of

430
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,600
intimate partner violence that's a super

431
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,430
fraud advice for several reasons

432
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,980
so first disconnection can greatly

433
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,709
escalate your bodily risk so this is a

434
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,209
quote from a social worker in New York

435
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,339
City who told us disconnecting often

436
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,319
makes it worse her clients were much

437
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,089
more at risk when they actually separate

438
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,949
from their abusers because suddenly the

439
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,750
abuser no longer has any control over

440
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,819
the victim so the only thing the abuser

441
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,500
has left is the phone and if you change

442
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,630
her number he's most likely gonna go

443
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,220
crazy and that's when he's gonna start

444
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,010
stalking you any way he can so weirdly

445
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,529
and sort of counter intuitively in some

446
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,089
sense you might actually not want to

447
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,980
over protect yourself against tech

448
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,470
mediated abuse if the risk is that

449
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,940
that's going to lead to other vectors of

450
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,209
abuse like physical or sexual abuse the

451
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,709
deletion of abusive material can also

452
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,050
make it harder for victims to do things

453
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,639
like retain evidence that they need for

454
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,010
prosecution it can cut off social

455
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,990
support that they need to further kind

456
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,149
of help them get out of the relationship

457
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,519
right and Plus you may actually need to

458
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,260
make maintain contact with your abuser

459
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,790
if you have things like children that

460
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,310
you have joint custody of another

461
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,750
difference is that when your adversary

462
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,399
is intimate it totally changes the

463
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,630
nature of what it means to be

464
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,209
authenticated so in most contexts we

465
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,620
tend to think of an

466
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,330
who doesn't probably know you personally

467
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,460
and is connecting from somewhere else

468
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,520
right connecting remotely but an

469
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,930
intimate partner violence an attacker

470
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,790
can compel disclosure of things like

471
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,710
your access credentials super easily and

472
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,600
might have physical access to your

473
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,850
device in your accounts by the nature of

474
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,110
the relationship that you're in with

475
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,720
them right so in many cases things like

476
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,300
phones right like an abuser or excuse me

477
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,610
a survivor would tell us oh well my

478
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,140
abuser has access to the phone because

479
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,090
it's his phone he bought the phone right

480
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,310
or we have a family plan

481
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,950
and so my abuser has access to all my

482
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,070
communications data because he can see

483
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,680
that right on the account page he can

484
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,570
also very likely guess the answers to

485
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,640
your security questions he probably has

486
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,890
your password or if he doesn't he can

487
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,470
physically threaten you to get it so the

488
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,970
sort of obvious privacy and security

489
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,500
solutions don't work here because of the

490
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,000
context something like an access

491
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,130
credential is almost meaningless to

492
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,620
people in these situations now this

493
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,180
other big issue that we're also looking

494
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,100
at is spyware so there's a bunch of

495
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,960
concern right about the installation of

496
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,550
spyware apps that detect things like

497
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,560
location and communications data and

498
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,170
lots of other information and which are

499
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,090
often really explicitly marketed towards

500
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,600
abusive partners but there's this other

501
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,310
big issue that I think is less noticed

502
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,720
which has to do with what we call dual

503
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,520
use apps so these are things that are

504
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,050
really common that all of us probably

505
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,480
haven't used things like find my phone

506
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,670
or find my friends or some of the

507
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,079
parental trackers for kids that I

508
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,270
alluded to earlier right many of which

509
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,069
can also be used for surreptitious

510
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,339
tracking so our research shows that the

511
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,430
advertising often suggests these uses so

512
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,780
if you search for example on the Google

513
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,670
Play Store for track cheating boyfriend

514
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,500
the first advertised thing that comes up

515
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,000
is a parental tracker right because you

516
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,460
can use that for that purpose so the key

517
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,210
here though is that this is

518
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,800
off-the-shelf software right this

519
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,330
doesn't require you to be some crazy

520
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,370
hacker that you can you know you root

521
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,780
the phone or use some great software

522
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,670
exploit you don't have to have great

523
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,440
technical skill to do this this isn't

524
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,260
this isn't really hacking now all of us

525
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,760
work has led us to develop a new model

526
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,320
that we're calling the UI bound

527
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,600
adversary which we're defining as being

528
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,850
an authenticated adversarial user of a

529
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,950
system who carries out attacks using

530
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,720
basically just standard user interfaces

531
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
right pretty untechnical sophisticated

532
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,780
attacks but they're really complicated

533
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,340
to mitigate right because of the social

534
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,680
and relational context around them so

535
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,030
now we're doing work to see if we can

536
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,560
develop tools to better characterize

537
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,500
behaviors that are unique to abusers to

538
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,240
better to text by we're on phones and

539
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,740
then we're also thinking about how to

540
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,960
design and evaluate user interfaces

541
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,460
better in light of this model so I'll

542
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,900
tell you just a little bit about one

543
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,080
little thought about the user interface

544
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,730
part and this isn't intended to address

545
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,900
all of the stuff I just told you about

546
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,050
but it's just one example so one I know

547
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,640
this seems like a weird slide to put up

548
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,050
after everything I just told you but one

549
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,430
potential way to address some of these

550
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,290
threats is by building apps that hide

551
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,150
what they really are so some people call

552
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,610
that a steganographic approach am i

553
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,200
thinking here is influenced maybe

554
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,230
surprisingly by the NCAA tournament it's

555
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,670
a silly example but I think it makes the

556
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,280
point so during the first round of March

557
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,630
Madness or like how many people watch

558
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,940
March Madness there are some people

559
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,500
whenever I talk to academics like nobody

560
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,630
watches basketball so I'm glad that you

561
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,580
guys actually maybe know what that is

562
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,530
so it's this big basketball tournament

563
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,780
right and in the first round they're

564
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,960
like 32 games ish to get through and a

565
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,310
lot of them are on during the day right

566
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,750
and so people want to watch them there's

567
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,120
this documented productivity drop in

568
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,650
American companies during the first few

569
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,970
days of the tournament every year

570
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,980
because people want to watch and so

571
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,270
because their undoing the day people

572
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,190
have to watch at work and there are

573
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,900
streaming options now available that let

574
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,560
you do that

575
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,570
so since people need to watch basketball

576
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,870
at work need to watch basketball at work

577
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,340
they need a good way to do that on the

578
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,740
sly right they need a good way to easily

579
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,480
get cover for what they're doing with

580
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,820
something kind of work II so I don't

581
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,290
want to if any of you can actually see

582
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,420
or maybe you know because you've done

583
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,900
this what on this slide indicates kind

584
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,290
of a surreptitious like escape hatch the

585
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,970
boss button there it is the boss button

586
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,110
see on the upper right-hand corner

587
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,240
there's this little tiny button that

588
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,910
says boss button which you click when

589
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,760
the boss is walking by and this comes up

590
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,350
which you know looks like pretty work II

591
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,480
like whatever your line of work is

592
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,750
probably there's some graphs so the

593
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,340
n-c-double-a has been doing there's like

594
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,350
a great article that shows like what the

595
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,090
boss button has brought up each year and

596
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,500
each year at some variation on this

597
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,940
essentially the eventually branded then

598
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,409
they got like sponsors to do the boss

599
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:16,200
button they put jokes in them some

600
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,730
computer games have something similar

601
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,649
it's a decoy right to avoid getting

602
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,600
caught screwing around at work right and

603
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
it's kind of like a fun it's funny but I

604
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,799
think it actually gets it a really

605
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,260
important idea which is that in the

606
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,940
context of trying to watch basketball at

607
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,100
work your adversary is physically

608
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,260
co-present right it's your boss and

609
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,059
they're looking over your shoulder

610
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,080
they're trying to see what you're doing

611
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,250
with your device and maybe they have

612
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,350
like some visual access at least to the

613
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,500
device so this this idea actually has

614
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,120
applicability for people in some

615
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,529
dangerous situations where somebody else

616
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,899
might similarly have kind of over the

617
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,220
shoulder access to what you're doing

618
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,960
and there this is so this is obviously

619
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,580
just like one small kind of silly

620
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,020
example but there actually are a few

621
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,880
sites in the in the intimate partner

622
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
violence context that use some kind of

623
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,570
like escape button like this to try and

624
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,630
let you get out really quickly so the

625
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,100
reason I told you there's these three

626
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,409
stories which might seem quite distinct

627
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,779
from one another is that you know we

628
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,570
often talk about data fication as being

629
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,460
this really impersonal dynamic right

630
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,039
this dynamic that somehow separates us

631
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,630
from real life or from intimate life in

632
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,100
some way that's kind of the common media

633
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,950
take about it but obviously data is not

634
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,289
impersonal right data is super personal

635
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,659
and very intimate in a bunch of ways it

636
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,880
weaves itself it weaves itself into our

637
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,740
homes into our workplaces into our

638
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,169
relationships and sometimes it intrudes

639
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,240
into our bodies into the way we take

640
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,230
care of one another

641
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,179
and even into the ways that we try to

642
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,049
hurt one another so beyond compliance

643
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:44,039
there are a bunch of ethical issues

644
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,929
involved right in how we design for our

645
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,880
technologies if we think about how

646
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,460
intimately those technologies affect us

647
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,860
and if we think especially about how

648
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,830
they're going to get used in existing

649
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,059
asymmetries of power right there are

650
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,370
always power differentials in every

651
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,380
context right on the ground whether

652
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,090
that's in the home in the workplace and

653
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,909
an intimate relationship and so i I've

654
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,350
been really interested in kind of

655
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,549
thinking about that and thinking about

656
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:09,740
how we can use technology

657
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,630
try and remediate some of those

658
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,240
asymmetries and I really appreciate the

659
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,920
chance to show these snapshots to you

660
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,120
and I wish you a really excellent

661
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,500
conference Thanks
