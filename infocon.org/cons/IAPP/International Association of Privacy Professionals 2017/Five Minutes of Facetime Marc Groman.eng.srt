[Music]

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,230
I got my start in private he nearly 20

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,870
years ago to us as the internet and the

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,210
world wide web were really beginning to

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,090
explode and take off back then I was a

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,070
prosecutor focusing on internet fraud

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,830
and cybercrime throughout the FTC I

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,130
worked on a variety of laws regulations

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,990
trainings and workshops and ultimately

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,170
in 2006 followed the now-infamous VA

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,390
data breach where a laptop was stolen

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,449
with over 20 million veterans data I was

14
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,010
appointed by the Chairman to be the

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,970
FCC's first chief privacy officer I had

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,610
the responsibility of building the FTC's

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,549
privacy program from the ground up I was

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,379
responsible for the information of

19
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,659
literally hundreds of millions of

20
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,760
Americans and other individuals that

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,250
were collected maintained and used by

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,140
the Federal Trade Commission being the

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,760
Federal Trade Commission's first chief

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,250
privacy officer was both challenging and

25
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,010
incredibly interested in part because

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,960
the Federal Trade Commission serves as

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,840
the federal government privacy regulator

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,549
and therefore I had dual

29
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,310
responsibilities I certainly focused on

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,100
the FTC's own practices and collection

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,130
of PII but it also worked on the FTC's

32
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,189
enforcement regulations workshops and

33
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,289
consumer education relating to issues

34
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,140
around privacy technology and innovation

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,020
it was an extraordinary experience that

36
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,960
gave me frontline views of privacy at

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,770
the ground level

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,500
I was incredibly fortunate at the White

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,390
House at the Federal Trade Commission in

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,090
my other career opportunities to work

41
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,130
with extraordinary people because

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,000
success depends on having great team

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
members but it also depends on having

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,710
support and leadership from the top and

45
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,690
I have that at the White House with the

46
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,700
president in the OMB director I've had

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,040
it at the FTC with all the FTC Chairman

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,990
I had the pleasure to work for and in

49
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,970
other avenues as well

50
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,200
I left the White House in january of

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,300
this year and a lot of people been

52
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,400
asking me what's next I haven't decided

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,740
yet but I can promise you that I will

54
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,200
remain actively engaged in the world of

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,690
privacy because these are the issues i'm

56
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,870
passionate about issues such as

57
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,600
technology innovation data analytics

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,450
artificial intelligence I want to work

59
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,730
on all of these issues I want to help

60
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,010
transform privacy from a compliance

61
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,250
issue to an issue that is about risk to

62
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,840
an issue that helps us promote

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,060
innovation promote the white feel

64
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,519
adoption of Technology and helps

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,340
consumers embrace new technologies

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,640
because that at its core what privacy is

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,190
truly about and it's my hope that all

68
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,720
the opportunity to work on global issues

69
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,100
because privacy in 2017 is a global

70
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,989
issue data does not respect

71
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,420
international borders and therefore we

72
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,300
need to work on addressing privacy so

73
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,670
that we have a coherent regime across

74
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,310
the world so that all industry in all

75
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,400
countries can do business and innovate

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,560
and bring the great new technology that

77
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,010
we need

78
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,739
anyone who knows me knows how passionate

79
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,299
I am about privacy technology innovation

80
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,799
data governance and responsibility and

81
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,299
therefore receiving this award from ia

82
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,810
PP is both personally and professionally

83
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,640
meaningful in part because there are so

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
many other individuals who are deserving

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,049
of this award this year and to be

86
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,900
selected among the many many capable and

87
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,670
talented people out there in our

88
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,400
profession is an honor I believe that

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,370
privacy is the greatest profession that

90
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,480
anyone can be in in 2017 privacy is at

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,930
the intersection of law technology and

92
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,609
policy getting the privacy issues right

93
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,739
enables innovation it promotes the

94
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,750
whitetail adoption of Technology it

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,380
fosters information sharing so privacy

96
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,810
today there could not be a better

97
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,570
profession and I look forward to the

98
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,039
future working with all of you
