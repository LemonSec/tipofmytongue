00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,929
I'm deeply honored to be this year's

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,000
recipient of the IEEE apt privacy

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Vanguard Award I know there are so many

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,960
privacy professionals out there doing

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,150
amazingly innovative work so to be

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,430
recognized in this way by a group of my

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,019
peers is extremely humbling

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,500
my career in privacy began about 17

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,270
years ago when I moved to New York to

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,150
become a privacy consultant at PwC I was

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,380
mainly working on internet-based

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,480
projects at that time I'm very

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,010
interested in the intersection between

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,700
policy and technology and I soon took a

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,739
leap into the technology industry to

17
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,720
leave watchfires privacy technology

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,870
business in 2004 I was lucky enough to

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,450
be offered a job to join Microsoft's

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,580
privacy team and I became the chief

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:11,729
privacy officer in 2010 in one respect

22
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,710
Microsoft's privacy strategy is

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,470
evergreen to build and maintain customer

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,750
and stakeholder trust regarding data use

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,540
but what has changed significantly is

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,100
the landscape in which we apply that

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,130
principle our mission is to empower

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,350
every person in every organization on

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,840
the planet to achieve more and as we do

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,720
that we're increasingly building

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,179
intelligence into everything we offer

32
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,190
not only that Microsoft is playing a

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,289
significant role in a broader digital

34
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,060
transformation that's occurring across

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,600
all industries as we do that we take

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,270
many steps to ensure privacy principles

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,179
are upheld empowering people and

38
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,420
organizations to make meaningful choices

39
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,679
embracing strong accountability and

40
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,140
security practices helping our customers

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,630
comply with new regulations like the

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,289
gdpr

43
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,289
and actively taking a strong stand for

44
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,950
our customers privacy rights

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,590
to the extent I've been successful in my

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,870
career today I would say it's by being

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,610
curious and learning from others

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,710
I've always tended to focus on what's

50
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,050
next striving to learn and understand

51
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,540
technology shifts changes in data use

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,580
and the evolving regulatory landscape

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,040
I've also been lucky to be surrounded by

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,020
great people to learn from throughout my

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,030
career managers and peers and the

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,980
various roles they've had and a wide

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,690
range of other influences across

58
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,480
industry that I've been able to tap into

[Music]

60
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,900
to stay current in such a dynamic

61
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,270
profession like privacy I take advantage

62
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,710
of the wide range of information

63
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,530
available today including great

64
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,080
resources available from the ITP they

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,450
also spend time engaging in discussions

66
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,300
and forums outside the company with

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,280
regulators with think tanks with

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,520
customers civil society and the like and

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,590
take a step back it seems clear that the

70
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,690
privacy professions transforming to

71
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,580
embrace the new realities of this

72
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,680
data-driven world

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,730
privacy professionals will increasingly

74
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,130
be called upon to broaden the scope of

75
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,140
their impact in enabling valuable and

76
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,420
ethical use of data while ensuring

77
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,550
societal rights and freedoms are upheld

78
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,830
it's an exciting time to be in the

79
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,260
profession and once again I'm deeply

80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,060
honored to receive this recognition from

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,850
