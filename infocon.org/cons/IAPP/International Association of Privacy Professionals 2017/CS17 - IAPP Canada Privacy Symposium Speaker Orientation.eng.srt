173
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,740

advancer and i'm going to pay it back to

215
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,809
Sam to tell you a little bit more about

216
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,030
how you can promote your session that is

217
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,390
wonderful Amanda that might be the best

218
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,440
operational details have ever been

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,430
presented on our last call absolutely

220
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,200
spectacular so I want to just emphasize

221
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,500
a couple of points there one is the

222
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,210
deadlines the sad gray non headshot is a

223
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,750
real thing right so I'm deciding which

224
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,360
one to go to and I click on the speakers

225
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,850
and I see the sad grey head shot there's

226
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,380
no way I'm going to see that person

227
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,330
speak because who wants to listen to a

228
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,750
sad grey head shot speak that's awful so

229
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,210
it's in your own best interest to get

230
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,400
your smiling face up there unfortunately

231
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,990
if you're attending this and you put it

232
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,310
in your calendar you're probably one of

233
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,750
the people that got us a head shot so

234
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,280
i'm probably speaking to people who

235
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,530
follow the rules but we're going to

236
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,170
emphasize that anyway more importantly

237
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,940
is the deadline around getting your

238
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,400
presentation in the reason we ask for

239
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,640
this is because we post all the

240
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,710
presentations that we get so that people

241
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,620
can download the slides in real time as

242
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,930
they are watching you present should

243
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,480
they should they want to this will keep

244
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,070
people saying hey we're going to get a

245
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,140
copy of the slides can you email me the

246
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,150
slides you'll be able to say right in

247
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,910
your presentation go right online click

248
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,950
the download presentation you can have

249
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,030
it immediately it is it's a great way to

250
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,790
keep people focused in the room and make

251
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,380
sure they can take notes and all that

252
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,960
kind of stuff yeah this is dave i wanted

253
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,820
to also jump in and underscore something

254
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,140
unless mentioned a moment ago and that

255
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,480
is to review your session description

256
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,450
online one piece of criticism that we

257
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,610
sometimes get following the conference's

258
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,170
is that I went to the session I walked

259
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,910
in the room I sat down and I was

260
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,320
expecting to hear one thing and I heard

261
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,450
something very different so please know

262
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,070
that people do read those session

263
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,780
descriptions and they use them to decide

264
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,120
what sessions they want to go to

265
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,170
oftentimes when they have two or three

266
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,960
they want to go to they choose yours

267
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,010
because they really want to be there and

268
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,120
they're expecting to hear what was

269
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,590
reading up in that paragraph so that

270
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,910
paragraph doesn't matter so please

271
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,200
review it and make sure that it matches

272
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,660
the content as close as possible to

273
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,910
deliver in the room great point day that

274
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,550
is certainly high amongst the list of

275
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,470
criticisms we

276
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,320
the panel wasn't what I thought it was

277
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,960
all right so we want to make sure that

278
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,480
you as volunteers also get sort of as

279
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,920
much exposure and benefit as you can

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,260
also if you want to drum up attendance

281
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,630
that you can do so we have a number of

282
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,850
publications here at the IEP p that you

283
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,240
can take advantage of dave as i said

284
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,070
earlier heads up all of our web

285
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,280
conferences if you think there is an

286
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,920
ancillary web con topic that would help

287
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,620
kind of set up your session or if you

288
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,600
think there's a deep dive after the fact

289
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
that would extend the message there dave

290
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,830
is always looking for web conferences

291
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,070
especially in Canadian realm yes

292
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,380
absolutely we need to check that box for

293
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,630
our CIP PC holders that they can get

294
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,270
their CPS this is a great way to do it

295
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,980
is to use some of these Canadian

296
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,800
specific presentations you can present

297
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
to the 500 people who show up at

298
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,880
symposium but then you can also present

299
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,450
to the world at large it can make sense

300
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,640
similarly privacy perspectives is our op

301
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,820
ed page if yours is opinion focused you

302
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,290
might want to tee up your presentation

303
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,480
that way the advisor is more of our

304
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,660
how-to operational piece privacy tracker

305
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,880
looks at the progression of laws and

306
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,300
moves to the system privacy tech is for

307
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,400
as you might expect the technology that

308
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
drives privacy if you think your

309
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,580
presentation could be Twp or augmented

310
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,460
or anything like that please let us know

311
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,580
and we'll get one of our editors in

312
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,960
touch with you and we'll get that ball

313
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,490
rolling the other thing you can do is

314
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,570
you know if you're one of those social

315
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,750
media types don't tell Facebook but I am

316
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,820
no longer on Facebook myself because it

317
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,410
was making my life demonstrable worse

318
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,170
but should you be one of those people

319
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,630
that enjoys the social media experience

320
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,660
let us know about that too because we

321
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,610
actually have it as part of our social

322
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,460
media plan to you no call out and

323

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,690
we're definitely if you've got a handle

333
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,850
on Twitter and you and you're using it

334
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,440
off and let us know about that and we'll

335
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,940
get our social media team working on

336
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,110
that so I've just we've just rambled for

337
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,569
a little bit there is a QA bar right

338
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:32,579
there on the right-hand side of your

339
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,279
screen that's where you can type in

340
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,370
questions and we can address them now is

341
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,029
the time to type in any questions about

342
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,459
operations or leading up to the event or

343
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,130
PowerPoint details although I'm going to

344
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,360
go a little bit more into power points

345
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,190
in a second if you've got any questions

346
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,250
feel free to chime in and I will address

347
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,100
them as they come in so do know that

348
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,339
that's an opportunity for you so second

349
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,980
half of our piece is you know how to

350
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,560
have in a successful presentation at our

351
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,170
vet one of the things that we get a

352
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,449
question on all the time is you know who

353
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:15,269
are these people what kind of people

354
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,509
come to your event so to set the stage

355
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,959
we get you know a lot of variety and the

356
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,319
people that attend especially in Canada

357
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,410
we have you know a lot of first-time

358
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,019
attendees people who are have to go

359
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,209
figure this privacy thing out and we are

360
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,790
the largest privacy event in Canada so

361
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,589
they show up we also have veterans who

362
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,959
have been coming for the entirety of the

363
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,870
ten years of the conscious existence

364
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,420
there's a wide spectrum as you saw we

365
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,029
are very heavy in the public sector we

366
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,709
are very heavy in the healthcare sector

367
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,689
so you can expect to have those sorts of

368
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,860
people in your room and one of the

369
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,990
things that we encourage people to do is

370
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,180
write out the back i'ma do a check of

371
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,639
who is in the room do we have a lot of

372
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,380
veterans do we have a lot of rookies

373
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,170
that might help you sort of frame your

374
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,040
event frame your presentation and the

375
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,189
other thing to do is use those veterans

376
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:22,769
if you see them in their the IEP is

377
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:25,009
very tight as a membership organization

378
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:29,059
our veterans love to help and take part

379
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,679
you know use them if you see veterans

380
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,679
raise their hands use the Socratic

381
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,199
method to call them and ask them about

382
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,959
their experiences ask them to you know

383
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,339
augment something you're saying with

384
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,079
seeing whether that jives with their

385
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,119
experience that that's something that's

386
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:49,139
usually pretty successful in rmx so the

387
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,399
full points are seeing a pretty

388
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,439
self-explanatory will move forward from

389
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:57,299
this here so you know ask those

390
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,709
questions at the beginning to figure out

391
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,470
who they are you know one of the things

392
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,439
that we do get often is I couldn't apply

393
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:09,029
this information it was a little bit too

394
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,980
basic I wanted to get a little deeper

395
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,309
into the specific details people love

396
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:18,839
real-world anecdotes if you can take a

397
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,110
general sort of policy idea and make

398
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,660
that practical and show about how that

399
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,970
plays out in the actual sort of

400
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,399
workplace that's what people want right

401
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,790
so you know we've seen the eye appt

402
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,949
volved quite a bit in the last five

403
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:39,480
years it's it's moved from the what is

404
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,699
privacy how do i create a privacy policy

405
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,730
to how the heck do i actually do this

406
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,769
how do I staff up whose job is that

407
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,990
which person is in charge of that who do

408
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,610
I talk to how long is that going to take

409
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,850
what form do I use you know all those

410
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,339
nitty gritty details are where we are in

411
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,519
privacy right now especially in the

412
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,740
Canadian public sector where they've

413
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,209
been doing privacy for a little while

414
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,789
now this isn't brand new stuff they are

415
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:09,388
going to want you know tips of you know

416
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:12,059
very applicable quality yeah let me let

417
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,980
me jump in and just emphasize what Sam

418
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,260
was just saying again this is did you

419
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,079
can't say this strongly enough we

420
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,148
another complaint that we frequently get

421
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:23,099
as Sam mentioned is it was too high

422
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,888
level or even worse I just spent an hour

423
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,630
sitting in a room hearing people lay out

424
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,000
problems that I know existed and that we

425
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,730
all know existed really what people want

426
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,070
to hear are your anecdote

427
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,810
and certainly of course your success

428
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,300
stories ways you've found to overcome

429
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,830
the obstacles you have in your day they

430
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,900
work but if you're willing and

431
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,460
courageous enough they also want to hear

432
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,500
your fails right I want to hear what

433
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,420
what what we're wrong what you did about

434
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,610
how what you learn from it seriously we

435
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,620
get some very positive feedback when

436
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,210
people are willing to say hey this is

437
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,770
something that we tried to the problem

438
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,270
we encountered didn't work quite right

439
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,410
we were able to tweak it and make it

440
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,660
happen eventually and so those are the

441
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,910
kinds of things that people really value

442
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,290
we have a few questions coming in let's

443
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,310
take a look at those forward move on

444
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,750
interaction think of splitboards yeah

445
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,640
people definitely use flipboard's from

446
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,810
time to time if you see your panel being

447
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,160
you know very interactive that's

448
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,930
something that we can get we you know

449
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,620
generally have those available providing

450
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,110
our key to so there will be a Navy

451
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,350
person in each room so just bring your

452
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,830
USB that you know kind of stand there

453
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,650
awkwardly at the front and the AV person

454
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,900
will come and take care of you we have

455
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,960
laptops set up already ready to rock and

456
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,450
roll in each room so you just throw that

457
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,090
key in there drag it down try not to

458
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,830
give us any special malware that we're

459
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,710
gonna have to deal with later but that's

460
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,890
no problem at all see yes we went

461
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,720
through the uniform presentation

462
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,740
template because people were showing up

463
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,060
with the wrong aspect ratio their fonts

464
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,540
were breaking and flipping off the page

465
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,720
you know it was just ugly stuff in our

466
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,860
technicians we're having to scramble or

467
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,570
speakers we're having to scramble to get

468
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,610
everything looking right if you would

469
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,370
like to put your organization's logo in

470
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,460
the corner that the IEP p logo is not in

471
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,170
that's fine that's something that people

472
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,550
do but of course you know we are keeping

473
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,770
ourselves as far away from a sales pitch

474
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,030
as possible you may or may not have a

475
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,320
sponsored session and we understand the

476
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,240
goal there is to get in front of people

477
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,780
but as you're going to hear me say later

478
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,420
anything that smells like a self

479
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,100
promotion or sales presentation is going

480
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,610
he frowned on there that last question

481
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,309
here is I was able to get a wireless

482
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,710
Mike so not stuck down the podium yes we

483
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,600
do have handheld wireless mics that

484
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,450
shouldn't be a problem those lavalier

485
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,360
mics that clip on to like you know your

486
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,280
collar are a little bit more expensive

487
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,039
so we try to avoid those but the

488
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,570
wireless mic is fine just kind of hold

489
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,640
it up to your face and everything seems

490
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,309
to work pretty well oh and not it

491
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,320
possible to get a breakout room near our

492
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,720
presentation room so you can split the

493
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,390
group up in two to four case studies now

494
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,070
we can't have a second room we just

495
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,620
rooms are expensive so they're all full

496
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,250
up for sure can we see the setups for

497
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,929
the pre conference ahead of time and

498
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,650
change to facilitate the session yeah we

499
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,210
can show you how the room is going to be

500
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,150
set up for sure generally we have them

501
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,020
set in rounds for the workshops but we

502
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,890
can look into that Larry reach out to

503
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,130
watch your reach out to Amanda and

504
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,200
she'll get that information for you

505
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,190
because we do set up the rooms

506
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,150
differently and if it's a way that's not

507
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,309
good for that we'll figure it out

508
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:02,409
alright so let's let's keep moving

509
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,360
through the making the session more

510
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,270
advanced so this is a something that we

511
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,110
get feedback on a lot is even though it

512
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,390
seems kind of silly sometimes having

513
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,460
that agenda at the beginning of the

514
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,080
session so people kind of know where

515
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,570
it's going to start middle and end and

516
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,210
what you're trying to accomplish

517
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,740
sometimes that seems pretty obvious by

518
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,890
the abstract but we do get that feedback

519
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,780
fairly often people want to kind of

520
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,820
orient themselves know where they are in

521
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,549
the presentation this third bullet point

522
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:38,470
is really important if you're working

523
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,669
with multiple panelists a to emphasize

524
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,280
Amanda's point earlier there's one slide

525
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,200
deck we're not changing slide decks in

526
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,710
the middle of a presentation the days

527
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,480
where you know he was even remotely

528
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,400
amusing that you were bumbling around

529
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,080
with your powerpoint at the front of the

530
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
room are long over

531
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,570
right we want this to get up and get

532
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,840
going none of this homo I can't figure

533
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,990
out how to do this now that's things so

534
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,640
make sure they're all smashed into one

535
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,210
amanda can help you with that if need be

536
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,650
also you know make sure you've

537
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,990
coordinated with all of your panelists

538
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,370
even though each of you might be

539
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,590
speaking for 20 minutes and you you know

540
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,539
really have three separate pieces to

541
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,029
your how long presentation just make

542
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,429
sure that you're not rehashing stuff

543
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,740
that someone else has covered it's

544
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,419
always nice to get on a call so you have

545
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,640
a little rapport with each other and you

546
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
know you kind of have some idea of how

547
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,210
things are going to work and again we

548
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,710
are happy to help coordinate those

549
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,450
conference calls if you need them to we

550
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,340
have a conference line and we are happy

551
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,020
to coordinate speakers if that's

552
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,220
something that you need to have happened

553
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,659
let me jump in there quickly saying that

554
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,730
just say that we are actually very

555
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,710
willing to do that so take advantage of

556
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,730
that obviously we have a lot of

557
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,440
experience with these things and we're

558
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,600
happy to host that call and to give you

559
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,610
some feedback and some advice in terms

560
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,260
of how long a person speaks and how to

561
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,600
mix up the voices etc etc so take

562
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,070
advantage of us as a resource here and

563
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,120
do reach out if you want some help

564
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
coordinating your panel alright let's

565
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,090
keep it moving here uh so these active

566
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,880
learning techniques are not going to

567
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,620
spend a ton of time on them their most

568
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,700
relevant to our workshops presentations

569
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,320
that are you know more of the three and

570
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,059
four hour variety than the one our

571
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,250
breakout sessions but I want to put them

572
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,669
in front of you because you know the

573
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,460
research is out there it is almost

574
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,919
impossible now for people to pay

575
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,870
attention to someone speaking from the

576
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,279
beginning from the front of the room for

577
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,860
more than 20 minutes right so if you are

578
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,039
speaking without interruption at the

579
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,870
front of the room after 20 minutes

580
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,850
everybody is checking their phone there

581
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,799
is not a single person listening to you

582
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,200
anymore they have checked out they're

583
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,450
seeing what's ali's up to with a soccer

584
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,809
game and you know slaking their team at

585
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,330
home it's really important that you take

586
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,179
some time even an hour break up session

587
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,850
to reengage people and to check in with

588
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,789
them these are some ways to get people

589
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:08,580
active I'm not saying that all of them

590
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,169
are practical for an hour but perhaps

591
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:10,759
you can

592
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,089
take a little bit out of it so the

593
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,570
teacher practice and game it this is

594
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,239
just giving people a chance to sort of

595
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,159
work with it themselves right so if

596
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,449
you're talking about plain language in

597
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:29,479
privacy policy you might show them you

598
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,449
know a good example of plain language

599
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:34,459
then you might have them practice taking

600
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,320
something that's legal gobbledygook and

601
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,809
turning it into plain language and then

602
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,329
maybe you have a contest to see you know

603
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,669
whose plain language is voted by the

604
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,719
room as the most plain you know there's

605
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,879
a variety of ways to do that but there's

606
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,919
really good educational research that

607
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,809
shows giving people a safe space to

608
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:56,359
practice and then having them do some

609
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,069
competition is a great way to reinforce

610
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,129
learning having them talk to each other

611
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:03,469
if you can just take three or four

612
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,459
minutes in the middle of your

613
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,679
presentation and give somebody a

614
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,599
question to ask their neighbor and have

615
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,190
them talk amongst themselves for three

616
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,119
minutes and then bring them back

617
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,489
together our people love that right as a

618
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:15,619
good networking thing you know

619
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:18,769
especially you know at a conference

620
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,449
where maybe people don't know each other

621
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:22,729
hey it's an excuse where I have to talk

622
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,579
to somebody they get a little human

623
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:28,489
interaction the Socratic method the

624
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:31,219
personal favorite of mine you know point

625
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:33,049
somebody out in the front row and ask

626
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:35,389
them what is this what they experience

627
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:38,119
or where are they from or what did they

628
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,359
learn from you know X experience that

629
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,069
was bad or good that happened to them

630
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:45,319
bring them out of themselves force them

631
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,349
to participate put them on the spot you

632
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,819
know maybe their ears go red for a

633
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,169
second but it's a great way for

634
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,749
everybody to reengage even if they think

635
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:57,289
gosh I hope he doesn't call me next this

636
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,629
idea of listening teams this is

637
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,839
something that's really going through

638
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,899
the educational circles is make them

639
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,929
into active listeners with a job right

640
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:13,249
before you present a specific topic tell

641
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:15,289
one half of the room that their job is

642
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,259
to listen for poking holes in your

643
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,049
argument and the other is listening for

644
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,789
the job of summarizing what your

645
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,750
argument was they will listen to

646
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,640
differently and they will report out

647
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,500
different things and that can force them

648
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,660
to think in different ways and they're

649
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,730
listening with a job they're not passive

650
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,980
they have a plan of attack and they

651
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,870
they're listening for certain cues and

652
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,010
what you're saying this can be a really

653
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,100
great way to engage them the host with

654
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,990
the most this is one of my favorite ones

655
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,880
is use superlatives somewhere either in

656
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,680
the middle or the end to have some

657
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,390
questions what's the most interesting

658
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,670
thing that we talked about what was the

659
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,980
the newest thing that we talked about

660
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,560
what's the most irrelevant thing that we

661
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,590
talked about that will get them thinking

662
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,900
sort of in different ways about what

663
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,530
they learned not just what they learned

664
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:11,700
the let's get physical or visual this is

665
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,770
just a reminder that everybody has

666
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,870
different learning modalities some

667
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,690
people learn well visually some people

668
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,580
learn with some physical interactions

669
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,250
some people are very auditory some

670
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,020
people learn better if they repeat it

671
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,630
out loud you know one of the examples

672
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,210
that I use here is you're talking about

673
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,640
privacy operations management have them

674
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,860
start out by drawing a picture of a

675
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,780
house that represents their privacy

676
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,420
program is it's small does that a lot of

677
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,640
rooms in it is it broken down is it

678
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,340
well-funded is it made out of brick is

679
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,290
it made out of straw you get some really

680
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,120
interesting things they're kind of spurs

681
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,420
them to talk about what they're doing

682
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,980
the quizzical is to ask maybe halves of

683
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,410
the room to come up with you know if

684
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,450
they pretend that you were making a test

685
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,720
to ask people what they learned in this

686
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,750
session you know what would you ask have

687
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,840
them come up with the quiz questions

688
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,550
you'll often be interested in what they

689
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,580
focused on and then finally I know that

690
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,230
role playing you know if there's

691
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,190
something that's going to get you to

692
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,920
roll your eyes it is role playing you

693
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,870
know we've all been in an awful HR

694
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,300
training where we had to do this however

695
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,820
it's very important to get people to

696
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,320
think about the other person's shoes

697
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,020
right so put them through a very brief

698
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,660
exercise where one person is the CP oh

699
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,280
and the other person is the regulator

700
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,720
how do they come at the issue

701
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,910
differently

702
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,100
or one person is the customer and one

703
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,260
person is the CP oh how might they

704
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,720
interpret the law differently but the

705
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,420
more you can do to get people into you

706
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,340
know other methods of thinking the

707
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,630
better I know that was very quick but if

708
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,040
you have any questions on that or you

709
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,500
want some tips on how to work those into

710
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,060
your presentation let me know alright so

711
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,380
we had a lot of questions about

712
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,580
PowerPoint PowerPoint sucks we all know

713
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,130
that however you know it can be a

714
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,590
helpful way to present some information

715
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,050
you know what's the sort of state of the

716
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,950
art with powerpoint now again use our

717
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,590
template don't try to get anything too

718
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,750
fancy that's going to break on you know

719
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,960
whatever machine we happen to use no

720
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,180
need for like the transitions where

721
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,670
things blow up my daughter is a heavy

722
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,800
PowerPoint user now in the eighth grade

723
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,320
she really likes the confetti that you

724
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,670
know everything blows up to and

725
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,700
transitions I think that's great for

726
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,710
eighth grade powerpoints maybe not for

727
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,040
you know business conference any longer

728
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,590
you know keep those bullet points nicely

729
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,820
focused like you see on this slide here

730
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,070
the one caveat here is if you are giving

731
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,010
a PowerPoint presentation in Japan I've

732
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,080
learned that if there's not 50 valid

733
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,400
bullet points on there they don't

734
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,340
consider it real or at least that's my

735
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,500
impression from going to presentations

736
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,350
in Japan they loved and heavy detailed

737
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,730
2.5 m it all on there oh they love it

738
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,260
let's keep going the other thing is that

739
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,760
you guys can read this here but we get

740
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,650
this question a lot do I have to have a

741
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,010
PowerPoint no absolutely not if you're

742
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,890
just doing a panel discussion don't feel

743
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,270
like you need to have a PowerPoint at

744
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,970
all introduce yourselves and have a have

745
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,620
a great discussion and give people some

746
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,850
information no problem however one of

747
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,740
the reasons we do encourage powerpoints

748
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,070
is because people do download them after

749
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,810
the fact this is a way to give people

750
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,600
information that they can use after the

751
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,100
event so you see this last bullet point

752
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,380
here an additional Reese

753
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,560
sources slide is something that our

754
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,870
attendees really welcome just a list of

755
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,030
links where they can dive in deeper or a

756
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,940
link to some videos where you know maybe

757
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,560
you've presented in more depth on a

758
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,530
certain piece of this topic that's a

759
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,090
great reason to have a PowerPoint even

760
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,860
if it's four slides and the last one is

761
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,110
an additional resources that can be

762
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,190
something that's really helpful for

763
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,500
people so that they can get a little

764
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,590
more sort of bang out of there one hour

765
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,630
breakout session buck yeah and on that

766
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,690
note I want to also state that we do get

767
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,250
a lot of requests for the slides after

768
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,750
the presentation you might consider

769
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,270
thinking about the PowerPoint as an

770
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,250
ancillary resource to your talk so

771
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,200
making reference to it like you know

772
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,550
there's some there's a lot of stuff up

773
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,080
in here you know feel free to peruse it

774
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,670
after the program i'm not going to go

775
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,380
over it in great detail but there's some

776
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,180
great depth further depth here in the

777
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,340
slides that just multiplies the richness

778
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,510
of the information that you're

779
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,120
presenting think about it as a resource

780
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,950
to be looked at after the presentation

781
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,450
exactly all right so that is pretty much

782
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,370
the whole shebang it looks like we have

783
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,110
a couple of questions here our

784
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,850
presentation wasn't listed in the

785
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,590
brochure is that because there are so

786
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,780
many yes the brochure is meant to just

787
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,010
be sort of a subset you know no sleight

788
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,440
intended if the marketing team didn't

789
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,920
decide yours would like the sexiest one

790
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,060
you know marketing people don't know

791
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,520
anything about anything anyway I'm sure

792
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,350
everybody's is the best and yeah that's

793
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,100
it so I'll twiddle my thumbs here and

794
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,630
talk out loud for another couple of

795
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,250
minutes of anybody else as and the other

796
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,760
questions as I was saying 50 times

797
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,580
earlier amanda is your point of contact

798
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,540
for any speaker conference and logistics

799
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,080
emails Dave and myself are available if

800
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
you have content questions your track

801
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,710
chairs are available if you have content

802
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,950
questions the thing that happens the

803
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,680
most often that we would really like you

804
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,510
to do this the right way is if you have

805
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,690
a speaker drop out we need to be

806
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,470
consulted on who that replace in person

807
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,500
is as soon as

808
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,280
possible we will not impugn your

809
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,440
character if one of your speakers drops

810
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,840
out on you we know that happens you

811
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,890
would be shocked by how many

812
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,800
grandmother's died every conference it

813
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,240
is countless dead grandmother's we but

814
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,790
we need to prove that or speaker

815
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,860
replacement surely the person you've

816
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,500
chosen is probably fine but we keep very

817
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,370
careful metrics on the male-female ratio

818
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:36,330
of our speakers on the organizations

819
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,530
that our speakers represent on the

820
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,570
number of speakers that we have so it's

821
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,370
very important that if there are any

822
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,650
issues with speakers we just are

823
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,110
consulted on that all right that was a

824
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,150
lot of jibber-jabber and I don't see any

825

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,560
that all of you have volunteer to speak

831
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,409
at our conference this is something that

832
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,560
I sincerely believe which is our

833
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,120
conferences are nothing without the

834
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,100
quality of our speakers the IPP

835
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,440
community is very very lucky to have so

836
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,940
many people willing to volunteer their

837
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,489
time and share their expertise with

838
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:25,040
their peers and with their community

839
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,690

840
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,699

and Rick's jobs they exist for no other

844
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:42,719
purpose whatsoever exactly they go home

845
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,730
and twiddle their thumbs until they can

846
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,800
come back and say is there a speaker I

847
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,530
can help right now and if there isn't

848
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,899
they drop into this alternate to spare

849
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,719
you know they can't really move the

850
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,450
ellipse barge over leaves helped a trick

851
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,730
and a matter right you don't want them

852
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,310
to be bored or anything so thank you
