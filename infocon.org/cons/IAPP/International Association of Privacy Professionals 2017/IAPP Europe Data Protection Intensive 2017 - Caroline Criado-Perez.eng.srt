[Music]

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,269
so thank you very much for having me

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,590
here to speak today I'm just going to

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,839
start off with a quick correction which

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,430
is that I didn't campaign for Jane

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,289
Austen on a bank note because we don't

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,640
have a lack of Jane Austen on a bank

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,990
note problem we have a lack of women on

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,850
a bank note problem so I was just

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,199
campaigning for female representation

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,060
and that's kind of relevant to what I'm

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,640
talking about today I'm because I'm

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,710
talking about how often we seem to

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,719
forget that women are 50% of the

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,480
population in all sorts of areas and and

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,430
in particular this is a problem when we

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,160
start talking about big data because if

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,170
the data doesn't adequately represent

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,329
the human population you're going to

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,469
have a bit of a problem when you start

21
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,059
creating policy around it when you can't

22
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,239
start creating products around it so I

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,770
just want to start with an analogy to

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,780
set the scene and I just want you to

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,460
imagine a world where we know absolutely

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,129
nothing about women I'm talking basic

27
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,680
female anatomy I'm of course talking

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,850
about grand theft auto and grand theft

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,220
auto 5 to be specific which was the

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,400
first time that not in the main game but

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,380
in the online version you could be they

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,600
had playable female characters the

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,220
reason that they didn't have playable

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,009
female characters in the real game was

35
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,320
that well this is the reason they gave

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,020
with this the characters needed have

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,759
narrative arcs and as we all know women

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,460
are famous for not having narrative arcs

39
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,900
any ways that you could play as a woman

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,740
in the online version and so obviously

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,750
being the rabid feminists that I am

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,100
looking for trouble I thought well I'm

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,509
just going to go and see what playing as

44
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,820
a female really means here so you I was

45
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,079
looking at all the options you could

46
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,189
have you know you can choose the

47
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,110
ethnicity you can choose the hair the

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,540
dress the makeup I feel I have but they

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,700
don't let my men wear makeup but they do

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,790
it on GPA they let men wear makeup but

51
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,850
anyway as you start playing for those of

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,439
you who played GTA you'll know that one

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,729
of the things that you can do is you can

54
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,689
pick up a nice lady

55
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,090
in your car and ask you to do things to

56
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,070
you or pay her really to do things to

57
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,459
you and they have three options and so

58
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,199
you're driving around as a lady trying

59
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,080
to pick up another lady and

60
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,730
anyway you managed to convince one and

61
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,110
she's like you know you're like well

62
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,730
what do you do and she says well you

63
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,530
know I've got these three options well

64
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,990
I'll go to the first option and then

65
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,760
this one's head comes and starts going

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,990
up and down in your lap and you're like

67
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,900
haven't got one of them it's not really

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,790
doing anything for me actually it's kind

69
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,360
of embarrassing teachers stop now and so

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,630
obviously to be clear I am NOT saying

71
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,910
that blow jobs for women is my campaign

72
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,330
for the following year but as I said I

73
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,830
think it's a really interesting analogy

74
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,330
for what happens if we build a world

75
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,910
designed around male needs and then just

76
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,200
stick women in there and kind of how

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,670
it's all going to work out because you

78
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,340
know men and women are the same right

79
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,340
so through the data gap more

80
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,460
specifically first of all what do I mean

81
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,740
when I say the gender data gap very

82
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,810
simply the gender data gap is a lack of

83
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,030
data about women compared to men either

84
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,670
because and that's the usual reason the

85
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,010
data isn't collected at all or because

86
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,580
it's not disaggregated by sex sometimes

87
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,810
it's actually also because of poorly

88
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,790
designed data collection systems so for

89
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,709
example there's a huge problem in the

90
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,330
field of development because traditional

91
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,310
household surveys have been designed

92
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,140
around male working patterns which is

93
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,810
that you have one job and you go from

94
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,070
you know you have a normal working day

95
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,110
whereas women tend to have a much more

96
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,550
complex for working patterns they may be

97
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,260
working two or three jobs they've got

98
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,720
unpaid work to do as well but the

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,820
traditional household surveys only asked

100
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,770
about each person's main occupation and

101
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,340
so women tended to say unpaid care work

102
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,180
but it didn't mean that they weren't

103
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,730
working a full productive work week as

104
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,750
well it just meant that they had

105
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,150
different forms of work women in

106
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,739
Bangladesh for example can work for as

107
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,440
long as 17 hours a day and whole sways

108
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,050
the women's paid work was unrecorded as

109
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,090
a result so that's what the gender data

110
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,000
gap is why does it matter in the example

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,209
I've just given for in agriculture

112
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,970
actually agriculture is one of the main

113
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,440
forms of the women's unpaid work and

114
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,239
women's paid work that wasn't collected

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,519
and it meant a whole load of aid

116
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,019
policies were developed and implemented

117
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,329
that only served male farmers needs and

118
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,470
completely left women behind and so as a

119
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,180
result female farmers started doing

120
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,410
worse and worse and worse than people

121
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,760
started thinking well female

122
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,080
farmers are just really rubbish like

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,360
come on guys catch up but what I

124
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,860
actually happened was that male farmers

125
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,100
were being given a leg up anyways so

126
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,090
this is design business like this issue

127
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,440
of design that only accounts for male

128
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
needs is an issue that crops up all

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
sorts of barriers from transport sure a

130
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,200
lot of the women here will recognize

131
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,360
this too medicine to the workplace this

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,250
is what comes up when you search Google

133
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,950
Images for human I find it really

134
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,830
interesting that weird like whatever he

135
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,020
is man comes up before a woman but

136
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,230
anyway so to be clear I'm obviously not

137
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,850
saying that Google is the body here this

138
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,930
is actually a pretty accurate

139
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,520
representation of what people mean when

140
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,160
they say human in fact I was at Foyle's

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,740
bookshop yesterday looking through

142
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,750
medical anatomy textbooks and posters

143
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,200
because I sure know how to have fun and

144
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,670
it was fascinating to me how you know

145
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,410
even in these medical textbooks these

146
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,120
medical posters it was still just

147
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,920
drawings of male bodies there was one

148
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,600
that I really enjoyed which was the

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,550
human vascular system which was you know

150
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,200
a drawing of a man and then they had the

151
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,210
little picture of the female pelvis to

152
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,150
one side but I mean at least the female

153
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,650
pelvis was included which he knows was

154
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,720
step forward anyway let me give you some

155
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,870
more examples of how we tend to think of

156
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,610
male when we think of human and only

157
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,460
female when we specify female so you've

158
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,990
got here the lego time feature

159
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,790
minifigure watch and clock which is blue

160
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,890
obviously for a boy girls can't have

161
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,020
blue and the lego time feature

162
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,420
girls minifigure watch and clock so

163
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,460
they're exactly the same except for the

164
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,970
one that's called girl is for girls

165
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,650
don't you know what's going on here but

166
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,600
thanks for March for illustrating my

167
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,610
point so brilliantly yeah this is a

168
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,090
great product from BIC and actually been

169
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,710
taken out circulation now I know this

170
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,410
because I spoke too thick about it

171
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,090
anyway fix for her turned out we thought

172
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,830
we've been using gender-neutral pens

173
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,480
turned out they'd be men pens all along

174
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,630
we hadn't realized and as part of my

175
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,190
research my book actually did get in

176
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,110
touch with BIC because the product

177
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,120
description says the pen is designed to

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,010
fit comfortably in a woman's hand and I

179
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,210
wanted to know if it actually done any

180
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,620
research into whether or not the female

181
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,529
hand is need a different pen and B

182
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,689
guys like women do tend to have smaller

183
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:43,909
hands than men and this actually is the

184
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,619
problem in all sorts of areas for

185
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,629
example huge smartphones that were very

186
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,399
very fashionable a couple years ago my

187
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,729
iPhone 6 gave me RSI tools being too

188
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,589
large for women's hands is a particular

189
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,359
problem in the conductor construction

190
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,879
industry a friend of mine told me about

191
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,499
trying to change the head on a Black &

192
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,749
Decker trimmer this was home work by the

193
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:04,399
way she's not in construction industries

194
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,799
but still listen to her story when it's

195
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,449
attached in order to change it you have

196
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,189
to press both cabs at the same time to

197
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,719
release it I think the man they had in

198
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,029
mind we'd do some one movement but the

199
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,589
span was - why - my hand and the

200
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:17,149
pressure required too much for my thumbs

201
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:21,169
to do base at the same time just to sort

202
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,029
of break for a second their hand grip is

203
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,879
actually also a huge difference between

204
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,739
men and women in fact the average 20

205
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,899
year old woman has around the same hand

206
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,549
grip strength as the average 70 year old

207
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,229
man and so there's quite a big

208
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,399
difference there so that's probably what

209
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,929
was partly going on there anyway she

210
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,749
continues and I'm 5 7 maddening and yes

211
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,579
my friends do send me these stories all

212
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,739
the time I'm a lucky girl eventually

213
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,749
worked out I could press one in first to

214
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,669
release it wedge something in to stop it

215
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:48,409
springing back into place then do the

216
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,209
other one they obviously never tested it

217
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,759
on a woman she concluded another friend

218
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,289
recently sent me a picture of her hand

219
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,759
covered in pastors after taking up the

220
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,049
flooring in her house she couldn't find

221
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:59,149
any work gloves to fit her teeny tiny

222
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:02,449
hand size and so on anyway unfortunately

223
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,979
I don't have time to go into details

224
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,809
about my exchange with bit pens and let

225
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:08,059
me assure you it was a thrill ride let's

226
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,889
just say the word fashion oriented

227
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,139
customers came up and I feel pretty

228
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,509
confident in saying that the bits of her

229
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,339
range was not in fact based on any kind

230
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,629
of sex disaggregated data on hand size

231
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,159
anyway when it comes to designing things

232
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,389
that don't work for the female body

233
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,479
Hansa and far from the only problem I'm

234
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,069
sure a lot of you will remember when the

235
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,349
Apple health app was released with much

236
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:31,599
fanfare a couple of years ago

237
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,099
accompanied by words like comprehensive

238
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,979
and sure it was pretty comprehensive

239
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,089
included tracking for things like copper

240
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,049
intake and molybdenum impressive I don't

241
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:42,558
know what that is

242
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:45,170
and but although the health app wasn't

243
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,559
called

244
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,360
health for men it did have a rather

245
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,129
glaring omission that kind of put a

246
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,269
dampener on the whole comprehensive

247
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,700
thing so yeah I mean base

248
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,010
it seemed like Apple took these Google

249
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,010
results for human remember these rather

250
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,750
to literally and kind of forgot all

251
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,540
about that and yet they didn't have a

252
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,210
menstrual tracker which is kind of basic

253
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,710
for women's health I mean it's kind of

254
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,060
the number one thing you might think of

255
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,480
that women might want to track but it

256
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,190
gets more serious and smartphones and

257
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,870
grand theft auto failing to account for

258
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,120
basic female anatomy there's a serious

259
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,860
gender data gap actually in medicine as

260
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,410
well so women are almost twice as likely

261
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,990
as men have an adverse reaction to a

262
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,690
drug and eighty percent of drugs

263
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,100
withdrawn from the market are due to

264
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,470
unacceptable side effect in women and

265
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,870
this is partly because women are hugely

266
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,670
and have historically been hugely

267
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,100
underrepresented in medical trials we

268
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,720
typically make up about twenty to thirty

269
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
percent and it's actually worse when it

270
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,680
comes to animal trials which is of

271
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,390
course what house phase one trials

272
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,610
happen even when a drug is specifically

273
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,900
aimed at women so you may remember the

274
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,520
Female Viagra that was being talked

275
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,960
about last year and everyone was really

276
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,440
excited about it but it turned out there

277
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,110
was a potential interaction with alcohol

278
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,360
and so the designers of the drug were

279
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,160
like well you know were very responsible

280
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,780
people we should probably catch this you

281
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,270
know seed see what the deal is so they

282
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,980
designed a test and they tested it on

283
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,740
twenty three men and two women and

284
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,750
that's probably fine right because men

285
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,920
don't have different alcohol tolerance

286
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,510
to women we don't but a belies that

287
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,300
differently it'll be fine yeah so um

288
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,180
that was a small problem anyway the lack

289
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,040
of representation is for a number of

290
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
reasons which I again I don't have time

291
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,910
to go into but the least convincing of

292
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,070
which is that the menstrual cycle cycle

293
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,260
makes women too variable to be able to

294
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,050
test which is you know all very well and

295
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,790
I'm so delighted for you guys in the

296
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,050
room that you've got such lovely simple

297
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,270
bodies and but the problem is we

298
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,430
literally do have a message of cycle and

299
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,350
so when we've put medication in our body

300
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,630
we kind of need to know how it's going

301
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,710
to affect us so emerging evidence

302
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,440
suggests for example antidepressants can

303
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,910
vary over the course of the menstrual

304
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,670
cycle and subsequently drug dosages may

305
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,250
be too high at some points and to lower

306
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,880
others

307
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,640
heart attacks is another example so

308
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,680
there's a certain type of

309
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,600
medications that has actually been shown

310
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,119
to cause a specific kind of heart

311
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,399
arrhythmia in women and it's much more

312
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,160
dangerous during the ovulatory phase of

313
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,629
the menstrual cycle so you can see it

314
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,930
really does matter that the woman's

315
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,399
menstrual cycles are taken into account

316
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,499
even if it is much more difficult I'm

317
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,569
sorry scientist that's just you know

318
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,129
women are complicated what can I tell

319
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:31,179
you and so staying with hearts and

320
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:34,459
rather like the human thing this is what

321
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,019
comes up when you search google for

322
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,639
heart attack and as you can see ie men

323
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,339
have heart attacks and obviously that's

324
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,369
not true and so the protection of course

325
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,259
is that heart disease is a male disease

326
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,509
but ischemic heart disease is the number

327
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:50,420
one killer of US and European women up

328
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,730
to 28,000 women a year in the UK die

329
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,670
from heart attacks and women are in fact

330
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,410
more likely to die following a heart

331
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,709
attack than men are and recent research

332
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:03,050
from UK found that women were 50% more

333
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,569
likely to be misdiagnosed while owning a

334
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,309
heart attack and for so much types of

335
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,809
heart attack that figure was almost 60

336
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:10,309
percent so you know we're not just

337
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,929
talking about people like you and me

338
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:12,800
here we're actually talking about

339
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,749
medical professionals miss diagnosing

340
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,730
women and because women's symptoms are

341
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,009
considered atypical 50 percent of the

342
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,800
population that's pretty atypical and so

343
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,939
yeah it's probably because of a lack of

344
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,089
awareness amongst opposed to public and

345
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,610
doctors but it actually goes beyond

346
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,470
those not just awareness so a lot of the

347
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,329
tests and clinical standards and this is

348
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,889
where the data comes in have been

349
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,929
designed using data from studies done on

350
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,300
male bodies again around 20% of the

351
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,879
subjects are female and usually when it

352
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,889
comes to a specific study the number

353
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,230
will be so low that it's not even

354
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,699
statistically significant you've just

355
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,110
got a couple of women in there you can't

356
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,389
really draw many conclusions from it and

357
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,839
so are essentially the test that has

358
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,720
been designed may not detect the

359
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,129
problems with women's hearts from there

360
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,540
may be sent home saying there's nothing

361
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,370
wrong with you it's also an issue with

362
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,709
treatment I'm just gonna give you one

363
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,899
example of that pacemakers are more

364
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,730
likely to be used in men than women we

365
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,439
don't really know why but academic

366
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,389
suggests this may be because of scarce

367
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,829
scientific evidence that they're working

368
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:15,649
women hello data gap and so there's a

369
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,019
heart implant called a CR TD which is

370
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,970
basically a more complicated version of

371
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,760
a postman

372
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,520
which is used on patients who have a

373
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,410
thing called a left bundle branch block

374
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,990
which basically means and I'm not I've

375
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,340
had to learn how the heart works it's

376
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,830
really complicated but basically what it

377
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,290
means is that the contraction of your

378
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,790
left ventricle is slightly delayed

379
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,640
delayed so basically there's an

380
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,080
electrical circuit that goes around your

381
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,090
heart for every time you pump blood

382
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,590
around your body and get it back into

383
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,930
the heart and there's a certain amount

384
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,570
of time that's meant to take and so in

385
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,010
this instance there's one part of it

386
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,150
that's delayed and the the sort of

387
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,350
guideline for when you're meant to

388
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,660
insert this heart implant so people have

389
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,270
a problem with their electrical signals

390
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,410
is that if it takes 150 SEC 150

391
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,300
milliseconds or longer you should have

392
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,580
one inserted and this is based on the

393
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,860
wealth of study data but you can see

394
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,780
what's happening here women only

395
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,220
represent around 20 percent of

396
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,130
participants in CRT studies and the

397
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,270
figures as I said are so low that

398
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,130
individual studies can't produce sexist

399
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,450
aggregated data that actually means

400
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,850
anything but luckily for women this is

401
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,860
where big data can be helpful actually

402
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,900
the FDA combined a whole bunch of

403
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,550
studies that have been done and this

404
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,080
isn't the best way of doing things the

405
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,070
best way is always going to be

406
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,960
randomized clinical trial but this is

407
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,670
the second best you take a whole load of

408
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,800
randomized clinical trials together and

409
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,270
you finally get enough women to be able

410
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,980
to make some kind of pronouncement and

411
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,470
what they found was that actually women

412
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,130
benefited from the insertion of a CRT D

413
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,750
when their electoral circuit lasted

414
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,920
between one hundred thirty two hundred

415
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,410
and forty nine milliseconds so that's

416
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,910
quite a lot lower than the male

417
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,920
threshold in fact women in this group

418
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
had wait for it a seventy six percent

419
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
reduction in heart failure or death and

420
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,590
a seventy six percent reduction in death

421
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,100
alone if they had a QR TD inserted in

422
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,440
them and in the slower threshold so all

423
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,720
these women were dying because the

424
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,130
threshold was set too high for the

425
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,860
female heart sometimes it's not just

426
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,200
about whether or not you have the data

427
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,540
it's about how you use the data and are

428
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,040
you using it in a gender sensitive way

429
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
or to put it another way do you have sex

430
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,690
ads disaggregated data on how to handle

431
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,050
your data so I'm going to give you a

432
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,370
real world example of how this might

433
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,910
play out

434
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,590
which just came up completely randomly

435
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,060
really in an interview I was doing for

436
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,990
my book about something completely

437
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,760
different I was talking to a

438
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,590
neuroscientist and it was just dark a

439
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,000
trumpet got elected so obviously we

440
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,260
started talking about the American

441
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,770
election and she told me that she had

442
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,480
been in America getting out the vote for

443
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,420
Hillary Clinton and told me about how

444
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,980
she and her fellow volunteers had gone

445
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,570
knocking on doors where a Clinton

446
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,600
supporter was known to live and quite a

447
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,580
few times the door got adopted by a mad

448
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,710
man who when they found he found out

449
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,260
that they were Democrats got extremely

450
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,960
angry and slammed the door in their face

451
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,360
um so these men it turned out did not

452
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,030
deport Hillary Clinton and nor did they

453
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,780
appear to know that their wives did and

454
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,760
this woman was kind of worried given the

455
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,350
high rates of domestic violence in

456
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,420
America and how very angry these men

457
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,670
were that there was a chance she may

458
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,930
have triggered some domestic violence

459
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,670
incidents obviously we don't know and

460
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,760
she's just basing that on possibility

461
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,320
probably better not to run that risk

462
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,040
though and around four million women in

463
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,230
a year in America are beaten in their

464
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,520
homes by their male partners or

465
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,950
ex-partners and I personally wouldn't

466
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,000
like to play those odds

467
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,100
so rather like Apple with its health

468
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,200
care domestic violence stats are

469
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,150
actually a type of data available to

470
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,830
political parties they should make use

471
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,740
of them the same woman in fact who's an

472
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,570
academic at a university also told me

473
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,280
about the vitriolic abuse she received

474
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,170
over email after a talk she gave at a

475
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,510
festival last summer her abusers had

476
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,949
found her email address on her

477
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:07,390
University website which is of course

478
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,240
pretty standard as a rule all academics

479
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,949
have a direct email address listed on

480
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,170
the University websites page and that

481
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,550
can be pretty debilitating as a female

482
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,810
academic they're just trying to get on

483
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,510
with your research and you've got all

484
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,010
and sundry able to send your emails

485
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,920
whenever they want um I actually used to

486
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,420
have a contact for my website which I

487
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,760
received I removed in the end because I

488
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,740
was getting worked through it but also I

489
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,480
was getting a hell of a lot of abuse and

490
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,920
it's not just the actual abusive emails

491
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,780
it's every time you get a ping you're

492
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,740
like oh it's just going to be a

493
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,810
desperate I'm not really feeling it

494
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,460
today thanks guys so anyway I I removed

495
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,800
that um but you know you have to

496
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,690
question our University's thinking about

497
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,440
this when there

498
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,700
climber's blanket policy are they

499
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,529
providing their female staff with extra

500
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,879
support to help deal with the abusive

501
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,259
emails they're going to get as far as

502
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,690
I'm aware they're not so I'm just going

503
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,070
to give one it's really hot under these

504
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,139
lights I'm just going to give one more

505
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:01,629
example by the way I know wait that's

506
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:02,080
not true

507
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,909
government women do you have different

508
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:05,289
body temperatures to men's that actually

509
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,480
they tend to be lower so it's not it's

510
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,679
not your fault it's not a male default

511
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,570
room and anyway so one more example of

512
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,340
how organizations can fail to design

513
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,659
products that cater to both male and

514
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,669
female needs even when there is actually

515
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:20,320
already data in existence and this one's

516
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,019
personal to me so some of you may know I

517
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,940
or in fact you all know because I

518
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,690
mentioned it right at the beginning

519
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,299
laughter I campaigned for female

520
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,190
representation on English banknotes um

521
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,669
and you know nothing crazy just a line

522
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:35,950
drawing of one woman for one note anyway

523
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,720
that campaign was won and I was

524
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,509
delighted battle over not so fast lady

525
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,429
said the men of Twitter who were not

526
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:45,580
happy and in fact they were mad as hell

527
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,409
about this line drawing of a lady and

528
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,669
they weren't going to stand for it and

529
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,740
they just demonstrated how much they

530
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,789
were not going to stand for it by

531
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,110
sending me some tweets so just going to

532
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,659
give you some examples of how angry some

533
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:03,730
men got about a line drawing of a woman

534
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,360
on a piece of paper this is the kind of

535
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,258
stuff they're going to do to me

536
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,690
anyway so these obviously are kind of

537
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,230
horrifying and terrifying I didn't mean

538
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,700
it right like they weren't really going

539
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,000
to come and do this to me ah probably

540
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,980
probably not I mean I didn't know who

541
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,240
they were didn't know where they were

542
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,890
and they what they were capable of they

543
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,420
were coming in every minute probably

544
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:40,150
probably wouldn't happen right and then

545
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:49,450
I started getting this and so what had

546
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,650
happened with this was that they'd

547
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,990
started spanning stop spamming me even

548
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,810
sorry through ask fm and I'm sure you

549
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,940
all know how that works some of you look

550
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,620
very confused so I'll explain it and

551
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,360
it's basically a platform where you can

552
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,450
ask not only ask a user a question and

553
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,940
their answer gets tweeted automatically

554
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,910
and if you include the Twitter handle in

555
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,690
questions of mine was included then I

556
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,330
get notified when this random person

557
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,850
tweets out and so I was basically

558
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,860
getting a tweet every minute saying we

559
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,690
know where you live and there was no way

560
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,150
to stop it just to clarify thankfully

561
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,680
this actually isn't my home address and

562
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,540
they did have my correct email but you

563
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,620
know you're not getting that that was an

564
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,910
office address but you know they'd found

565
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,690
that address what else could they find

566
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,670
and there was nothing set up at Twitter

567
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,890
or ask yet for ask fm at the time helped

568
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,930
me deal with this properly I'm pleased

569
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,100
to say a lot has changed at Twitter

570
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,170
since then but prior to this experience

571
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,700
of mine and all the attendant media

572
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,350
coverage twitter was simply not set up

573
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,730
to deal with the fact that women

574
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,860
routinely get abuse online in a way men

575
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,930
simply don't tend to the reporting and

576
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,160
blocking procedures were completely

577
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,110
inadequate for abuse at such a volume

578
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,150
they were clearly set up for just some

579
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,580
minor irritant that you had time to fill

580
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,550
in a five minute form that was on a

581
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,340
different website and you know

582
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,060
describing everything that had been said

583
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,980
to you so I would have to type in you

584
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,270
know we are going to mutilate your

585
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,880
genitals and shove a pole up your vagina

586
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,480
I didn't really want to type that out

587
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,540
so yeah and just to give you an idea of

588
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,950
gender discrepancy in online abuse

589
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,170
there's a fascinating pre-twitter study

590
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,840
done by Maryland University which was in

591
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,730
chat rooms

592
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,770
it's before Twitter and they set up a

593
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,780
bunch of fake accounts each with either

594
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,820
a standard male or female name and they

595
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,230
found that men got on average three

596
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,420
abusive messages a day women got a

597
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,430
hundred and the reason I'm telling you

598
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,260
about this particular research one of

599
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,430
course has been a wealth of research

600
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,290
done since then is to demonstrate this

601
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,150
sex disaggregated data was actually

602
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,220
available by the time that switch was

603
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,200
being built so rather like you asked to

604
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,550
assume that the Apple healthcare

605
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,200
developers knew that women had wounds

606
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,760
and periods when they didn't include a

607
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,380
period tracker in their comprehensive

608
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,450
help out Twitter could have considered

609
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,830
this data when they were building their

610
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,840
product and produced a platform but from

611
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,550
the very beginning accounted for the way

612
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,680
that women are abused online instead

613
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,150
they are now having to play catch-up and

614
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,350
that's much harder for them when they're

615
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,670
trying to change a culture that has

616
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,760
already become abusive so we live in an

617
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,860
era of big data and were meant to be

618
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,750
really excited about that and I would

619
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,730
like to share in that excitement but at

620
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,440
the moment my excitement is tempered by

621
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,440
two things first of all I know there are

622
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,000
huge gaps in our knowledge when it comes

623
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,710
to women which means that any use of big

624
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,630
data to design anything from consumer

625
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,270
products to government policy is hugely

626
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,860
problematic and potentially dangerous

627
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,960
but also that there are countless

628
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,090
examples of even when data does exist

629
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,430
we are simply failing to use it because

630
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,080
we are just so used to thinking that

631
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,360
this is what a human looks like so I

632
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,440
barely had time to scratch the surface

633
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,060
in this talk today but hopefully it's

634
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,370
given you a bit of an idea of the scale

635
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,960
of the issue and I'm going to finish now

636
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,750
I just like to close with a simple plea

637
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,850
just one action to take away from this

638
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,620
and into your life your work life your

639
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,260
day-to-day life it's very very simple

640
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,590
don't worry and all I'm asking is that

641
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,410
when you star in any new project you

642
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,060
stops just one second and you ask

643
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,670
yourself a very simple question have we

644
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,620
remembered to think about the 50% of the

645
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,420
population that just happens not to be

646
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,540
male thank you very much

647
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,889
[Applause]
