1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
so it's also my job to introduce our

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,679
next keynote speaker

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,480
who knows something about being hassled

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,160
by border guards

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,119
his name is peter watts he is a science

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,080
fiction author

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,039
a scientist and kind of an example of

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,520
the

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,359
type of voice we're trying to bring to

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
the iep in our conferences someone with

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
some great ideas someone who sees as his

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
crowning achievement the fact that he

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
once wrote a novel that was

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,559
deemed too dark for the russian audience

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,760
and they would not

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
uh translate it if you are too dark for

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,800
the russians

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
you win in my book you have done

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,800
something very very right so please join

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
me in welcoming peter watts

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
how's the volume good yeah the russians

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,039
actually ended up

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,640
publishing the book after all when it

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
started making money

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,080
um anyway

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
when uh when i first fielded sam's

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,680
invitation to talk to you today

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
my immediate reaction was that there's

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,759
some kind of a cruel hoax

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,080
and i gotta say having spoken to some of

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,439
you in the interim i'm still not

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,840
entirely convinced that it isn't

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
um

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,200
i am as has been pointed out a midlist

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
science fiction writer um i used to be a

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,720
marine biologist

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
what in god's name do i have

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,000
to say that would be of any interest to

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
anybody with

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,560
with an interest in privacy issues

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,119
and yet

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,040
i am not the first science fiction

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,240
author to make an appearance at one of

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
these things

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,439
i'm not even the first sf author with

46
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,520
scientific credentials

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
david brinn gave a talk a couple of

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,079
months ago at your dc

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,560
summit apparently on the tren on his

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
idea of the transparent society

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
i've heard him talk on the subject

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
myself i'm reasonably familiar with his

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
talking points

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,280
brynn argues that trying to legislate an

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
end to government surveillance will

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
never work

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,360
because we primates come with dominance

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
hierarchies built into standard

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
equipment

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
telling our leaders that they cannot spy

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
on us is the equivalent this is his

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
analogy of poking a silverback gorilla

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
with a stick they just won't stand for

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
it

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,239
but perhaps they might let us look back

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,840
so

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
we'll watch the watchers the camera will

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
point both ways the playing field will

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
be level

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
now the dude is a physicist so

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
i suppose he can be forgiven for

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
thinking that it would be anywhere close

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
to a good idea to get into a staring

74
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,040
contest

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
with a large aggressive territorial

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,760
mammal that is primed to think of direct

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,519
eye contact

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
as a threat display to name of

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
speaking as a as a biologist i myself

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,879
cannot recommend it to name a couple of

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
obvious examples

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
chelsea manning looked back and they

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,239
threw away the key ed snowden looked

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,760
back he got a

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
target on his chest more than one

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
silverback gorilla

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
has opined publicly that they would like

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
to see that man assassinated

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
on a more modest and local level we're

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
all pretty much familiar with the

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
litany of abuses that various law

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
enforcement officers heap upon the

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
citizens they're charged with protecting

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,599
we also know how they generally react to

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,799
being recorded

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,480
by civilians or even worse to the

97
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
suggestion

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
that we look back by putting cameras in

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
their cars

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
over in los angeles they already went

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
that route only to find that vital bits

102
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
of the surveillance equipment that was

103
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,400
involved in the process went

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,799
mysteriously missing in the field

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
um apparently for reasons that nobody

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,120
really expected cops don't like being

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
spied upon

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
so as ex-cia man barry eisler puts that

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
we are living

110
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,120
in a society where the government knows

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
more and more about the citizenry

112
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
and the citizenry is permitted to know

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
less and less

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
about the government um in this light my

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,720
own words come back to haunt me from

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,399
my altercation with u.s border

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
authorities back in 2009

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
the last thing i said to them before

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
they started throwing punches

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
was i just want to know what's going on

121
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
and yet if you look past the superficial

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,520
dumbness of the gorilla

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
example there is a fundamental truth

124
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,720
under there we are mammals

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
we were cobbled into existence by the

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
same processes of natural selection that

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,000
shaped

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,759
every other form of life on this planet

129
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,080
we do have certain hardwired responses

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
that were forged in our evolutionary

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
past and anybody

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
who thinks that their own behavior isn't

133
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
at least partly informed

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,919
by those legacy circuits is not been

135
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
paying attention

136
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
so i'm going to talk about a couple of

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,039
those circuits today i'm going to start

138
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,080
by suggesting that your whole

139
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
organization may have been misnamed

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,520
perhaps the hot button issue is not so

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,639
much privacy

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,680
as it is surveillance

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,160
now you might ask if that's even a

144
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
difference that makes a difference i

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,080
think it is

146
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,639
perfect example broke just yesterday

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
turns out the feds are

148
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,759
collecting our facebook and twitter data

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,120
no particular reason there's no specific

150
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
investigation going on they just

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
like to keep an eye on us you know just

152
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
nothing to see here

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,880
how privacy obviously is not the issue

154
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
here

155
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
nobody on a face on a social network has

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
any reasonable expectation of privacy

157
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
but you still

158
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,759
assume that you're just one voice in a

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
chorus and there is something

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,199
kind of visceral in the realization that

161
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,080
in fact what you are instead is a target

162
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,280
i think that reaction isn't so much

163
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
philosophical as it is instinctive and

164
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,039
i'm going to try and convince you of

165
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,319
this by asking you to find

166
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
god god is actually pretty easy to find

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
we think god got started in

168
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,759
paridolia which is that cognitive glitch

169
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,960
that allows you to see

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
faces in the clouds elvis and a burrito

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,479
that kind of thing

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
and we think of pariedelia arose as an

173
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
anti-predator strategy

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,560
as it happens i've just finished um

175
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
writing a novel that explores the

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
functional utility of the religious

177
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
impulse so i'm going to steal

178
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
an info dump from that book to help make

179
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
my point

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
look brooks wanted to say 50 000 years

181
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
ago there were these three guys spread

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
out across the plain

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
and they each heard something rustling

184
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,880
in the grass

185
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
the first one thought it was a tiger and

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
he ran like hell and it was a tiger but

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,720
the guy got away

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
the second one thought it was a tiger

189
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
and he ran like hell

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,599
but it was only the wind and his friends

191
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
all laughed at him for being such a

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
chicken

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,039
but the third guy he thought it was only

194
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,759
the wind

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,840
so he shrugged it off and a tiger had

196
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,599
him for dinner

197
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
and the same thing happened a million

198
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
times across ten thousand generations

199
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
and after a while everyone was seeing

200
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,479
tigers in the grass even when there

201
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,680
weren't any tigers

202
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
because even chicken chits have more

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,120
kids than corpses do

204
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,479
and from those humble beginnings we

205
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,160
learn to see faces in the clouds and

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
portents in the stars

207
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,520
to see agency and randomness because

208
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,639
natural selection favors the paranoid

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
even now we are wired to believe that

210
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
unseen things are watching us

211
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
and it came to pass that certain people

212
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,560
figured out how to use that

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
they painted their faces or they wore

214
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
funny hats they shook their rattles and

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,840
waved their crosses and they said yes

216
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
there are tigers in the grass there are

217
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,880
faces in the sky

218
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,319
and they will be very angry if you do

219
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
not obey their commandments

220
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
you must make offerings to appease them

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
you must bring grain and gold and altar

222
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,840
boys for our delectation or they will

223
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
strike you down and send you to the

224
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,599
awful place

225
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
and people believe them by the billions

226
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
because after all

227
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
they could see the invisible tigers

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
so cut to the present for a very long

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,840
time now

230
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
people that don't see agency everywhere

231
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
have a disproportionate tendency to get

232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,720
eaten

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
that's not so much a problem now but the

234
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
program persists we still see patterns

235
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,879
in everything butterflies and rorschach

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,639
blots faces and clouds

237
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
we hear ghosts and monsters in the

238
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,800
creaking of stairs at night

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,639
and we can make a testable prediction

240
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
here because if all of this does result

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
from an ancient threat response you

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
would expect that false positive pattern

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,039
matching

244
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,799
would intensify during periods of social

245
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,240
unrest when people are feeling

246
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,519
especially scared or insecure according

247
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,200
to

248
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
work out of the university of texas this

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
is exactly what happens

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
people who feel helpless are more likely

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,040
to see patterns in pictures of random

252
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
visual static

253
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,839
they're more likely to see conspiracies

254
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
and connections in unrelated events

255
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
belief in god and astrology also goes up

256
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,120
during periods of social unrest religion

257
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
tends to prosper in lands where people

258
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,959
have reason to be afraid it's far more

259
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,760
prevalent

260
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,000
in developing nations than in developed

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
ones

262
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
and the one exception that you might

263
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
want to cite for that the good ol us of

264
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
a

265
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
actually kind of proves the point

266
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
because in a very real way the u.s

267
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
is not a developed country

268
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,440
17 first world nations in this database

269
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
um australasian european and north

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,600
american i've highlighted us in yellow

271
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,640
for

272
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
easy access social metric along the y

273
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
axis

274
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
religiosity of the society along the x

275
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,519
the further to the left you are

276
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
the more fundamentalist you are

277
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
and as you can see um by any pretty much

278
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
any social metric you would care to name

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
i'm basically just showing you

280
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,279
what am i showing you um i'm showing you

281
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,360
infant mortality and homicide rate

282
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
but exactly the same pattern holds for

283
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
stds divorce

284
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
life expectancy a whole bunch of

285
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,440
variables that i don't have time to show

286
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,240
you

287
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
you'll find that the us is generally the

288
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
worst of the law

289
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
and it is also by a significant margin

290
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,600
the most religions

291
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
religion is also adaptive at the group

292
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
level not just the

293
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
individual one religious communes tend

294
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
to persist longer than secular communes

295
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
significantly other things

296
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
being equal and within those religious

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,880
communes the ones that lost

298
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
longest still are those that preach kind

299
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160
of a

300
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
vicious patriarchal peeping tom god the

301
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
kind of angry vengeful old testament god

302
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,480
that

303
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
catches you masturbating and casts you

304
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
into hell for the wickedness in your

305
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,399
thought

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
those communes seem to last longer than

307
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
other faith-based communities with

308
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
that believe in a kind of a loving and a

309
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,880
more generous deity

310
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
a myriad studies basically support the

311
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,760
idea that authoritarian religions based

312
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
on fear of surveillance

313
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,120
have a competitive edge in darwin's

314
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
universe just putting a picture of eyes

315
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,880
and i'm not even talking about a

316
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
photorealistic picture of eyes i'm

317
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
talking about

318
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,320
a lame-ass gary larson level pencil

319
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,360
sketch of eyes

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
sticking that on the wall will reduce

321
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,560
cheating exams

322
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
or cheating a behavior during tests so

323
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
will inserting the word ghost

324
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
into casual conversation something that

325
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,959
abstract is enough to scare us albeit

326
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,399
subconsciously into changing our

327
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
behavior

328
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
so when we talk about privacy we are

329
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
probably not talking about some cultural

330
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,959
artifact that arose wholesale out of the

331
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,800
victorian era

332
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
that's the first take-home point here

333
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,839
the link between surveillance and fear

334
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,399
is a lot deeper and a lot older than

335
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
your average post-privacy advocate is

336
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,200
willing to admit

337
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
now the usual suspects have done a

338
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
bang-up job of amping up the whole fear

339
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
side of the equation over the past few

340
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,040
years

341
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
but of course because of the correlation

342
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
what they've also done is amp up

343
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
our sensitivity to potential

344
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
surveillance

345
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,120
and despite the official narrative

346
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
when we look around we do not see a lot

347
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
of brown-skinned televists doing the

348
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,000
tigers share of the surveilling what we

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,279
do see

350
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,120
is the invocation of terrorism to cover

351
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
up the fact that an innocent person's

352
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,519
life was ruined

353
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,680
for eight years because of a typo on the

354
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
no-fly list

355
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
we see a woman denied entry to the

356
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
states because somehow u.s border

357
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
authorities have access to her

358
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
confidential

359
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
medical records i experienced

360
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
something like that similar myself back

361
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,720
in 1991 when i lived in guelph

362
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
i was caught at two in the morning

363
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
turning right on a red light on a

364
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
bicycle

365
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
i was pulled over and i asked some

366
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,959
impertinent questions about my civil

367
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,600
rights that got me hold in for the night

368
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
it was a fairly trivial infraction i was

369
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
never convicted

370
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
if you go looking for a record of that

371
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
on the archives canadian archives you

372
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,519
will not find it however

373
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,399
two decades later u.s authorities cited

374
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,160
that event to try and have me declared a

375
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,639
repeat offender

376
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,079
that gives you some idea of the

377
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
granularity of the data that our masters

378
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
were sharing a solid decade before 9 11

379
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,839
made it fashionable

380
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,639
turning from the personal to the

381
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
corporate uh not that corporations

382
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
aren't also people of course

383
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
we see things like the trans-pacific

384
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
partnership being negotiated entirely in

385
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,160
secret

386
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,040
we see consumer appliances spying on our

387
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
behavior and reporting back to home

388
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,360
office

389
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
even after we have found the hidden

390
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
undocumented menu that's supposed to

391
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
tell them to stop

392
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
we see an ongoing series of government

393
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,920
attempts to legislate

394
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
online surveillance of canadians without

395
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
any of that messy warrant and disclosure

396
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,160
stuff

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,200
what we see basically here excuse me

398
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
is stalking behavior and i mean this in

399
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
the biological not the sexual harassment

400
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
sense

401
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
corporate entities do it for profits uh

402
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
political entities do it to secure power

403
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,199
but in both cases what

404
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,600
we see is stealth and concealment

405
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,199
and we would hear things rustling in the

406
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
grass behind us even if there wasn't

407
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,760
anything there

408
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
because that just happens to be the way

409
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
we're wired

410
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
but it gets worse when somebody invokes

411
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
hackers or terrorists or

412
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,760
creepy guys in trench coats to justify

413
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
poking around in our private lives you

414
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,600
may remember when victor's

415
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
place basically played that chord tried

416
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,800
to describe everybody who was opposed to

417
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839
c30 is pro pedophile

418
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,600
a lot of critics claim that um

419
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,279
sir blanket surveillance amounts to

420
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,880
treating us all like criminals but i

421
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
think it goes deeper than that i think

422
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,399
what we really feel like is prey

423
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
now the good news is there's obviously

424
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,480
increasing awareness

425
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,839
that you can damp down a lot of these

426
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,320
alarm responses if you just stop

427
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
sneaking on sneaking around on us put

428
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
your tracking policies front and center

429
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
make transparent

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
the perfectly reasonable exchange of

431
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,279
personal data

432
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,000
for services you're going to engender a

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
lot less paranoia than if you secretly

434
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
change everybody's

435
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,199
privacy defaults and then hide the

436
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,519
controls to change them back under five

437
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,079
levels of

438
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,399
undocumented sub-menus even facebook has

439
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,760
managed to figure that out by now

440
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,839
the bad news is even if you want to be

441
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
fair and open

442
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
you're frequently not allowed to be

443
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
you have a lot of valuable data after

444
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,720
all and government and law enforcement

445
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,120
don't

446
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
really believe that we're all criminals

447
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,279
but they damn well know that some of us

448
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,560
are

449
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,279
so why not collect all the data right

450
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,839
now

451
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,680
so that whoever the bad guys turn out to

452
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,959
be down the road you'll have the

453
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,959
relevant data in hand

454
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,800
it is much easier to go fishing with a

455
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
drift net

456
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,440
than a long line if you'll forgive a

457
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
marine biology reference

458
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
who cares you can't end up tearing up

459
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,440
the whole damn seabed in the process

460
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
so even companies who care about

461
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,399
protecting privacy

462
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,079
still basically have to give it up when

463
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
the spooks come calling

464
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
and as we all know most companies don't

465
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,839
really care about privacy

466
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
just last week for example we discovered

467
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,000
that canadian telecoms

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
aren't just scraping our data for their

469
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
own profit they're serving it up as an

470
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,480
all-you-can-eat buffet for any hungry

471
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
spooks who happen to wander by

472
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
all served for a very reasonable service

473
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
fee to cover the mutual back scratching

474
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
expenses

475
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,360
still let us fantasize for a little bit

476
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
and let us assume that somewhere out

477
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
there there really is

478
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
a country that really does try to

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
protect client privacy

480
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
how do you do that when at any moment

481
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
you could be conscripted

482
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
as a law enforcement cat's paw this is

483
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
not the kind of a slogan that's really

484
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
calculated to engender a whole lot of

485
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,199
confidence but it's really actually

486
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:33,759
pretty

487
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,519
the only honest slogan so here's a wild

488
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,680
thought

489
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,639
don't just offer data protection

490
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,360
especially since you can't guarantee it

491
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,160
offer data destruction instead i'm not

492
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,040
talking about

493
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,880
brin world where everybody knows

494
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
everything and the lions lie down with

495
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,079
the lambs

496
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,920
i'm talking about a more darwinian place

497
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,839
where when the lions come calling

498
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,360
you burn down your chunk of the belt

499
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,560
before they get their hands on it

500
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,599
so forget the transparent society what i

501
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,280
guess i'm advocating is the scorched

502
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
earth society

503
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
i do not expect many of you to embrace

504
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,919
this i'm told that

505
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
i'm told that a lot of lawyers show up

506
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,079
at these things and

507
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,000
i'm guessing the standard legal toolbox

508
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,839
does not come equipped with a standard

509
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,439
middle finger to stick to authorities

510
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,679
then again lawyers also know that the

511
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,960
law is an ass

512
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
they know that some are more equal than

513
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,400
others

514
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,039
that cats get to write the laws for mice

515
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,480
that bush and cheney will never be

516
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,320
indicted for war crimes

517
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,200
in this particular case our goal here is

518
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
to blind big brother

519
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
does anybody really expect that the law

520
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,840
will ever smile on that goal

521
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,280
when the guys who write the laws are the

522
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
same ones who want to spy on us

523
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,720
i think bryn's dead right on that score

524
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,960
at least

525
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
so let's admit that any effective

526
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
privacy strategy is

527
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
almost by definition bound to be on

528
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,760
shaky legal ground

529
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
and proceed from there the government

530
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
shows up and demands all your metadata

531
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
you hit a kill switch everything

532
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,360
evaporates

533
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,799
there's nothing left for them to pillage

534
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,520
pretty stupid right it's like some

535
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,600
schoolyard revenge fantasy you know

536
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
giving a little finger to the man you'd

537
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
probably find more emotional maturity in

538
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,480
a harry potter novel

539
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
it had never happened because when the

540
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
feds show up you either cave

541
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000
or you pay the price okay well maybe

542
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
lava bit didn't cave but that had to

543
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
hold you with the

544
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
ed snowden thing so that was probably an

545
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
anomalous event

546
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,360
okay maybe cryptocell didn't cave either

547
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,960
but twice is still just a coincidence

548
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
three times maybe we're looking at a

549
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
trend

550
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,960
now it's painfully obvious to all of you

551
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,320
by now that i don't know anything about

552
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,160
the law

553
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
what i do know about is biology i have

554
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
some sense of where we came from as a

555
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
species

556
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
i know that ethics and morality are not

557
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
human traits they are mammalian ones

558
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
caputians feel empathy chimps have a

559
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,120
sense of fair play

560
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,960
any number of social mammals have

561
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,559
what you might want to call a justice

562
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
instinct a drive to

563
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,160
punish cheaters and freeloaders in the

564
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
community our own species

565
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
is hardwired for revenge to the point

566
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,919
where we will

567
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,720
punish those who trespass against us

568
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
even if meeting out that punishment

569
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
hurts us

570
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
more than it hurts our transgressors we

571
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
will cut off our nose

572
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,440
despite our faces how that runs the

573
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,160
gamut from relatively trivial

574
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,840
financial games in which people feel

575
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
cheated out of small amounts of money

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,960
all the way up

577
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,000
to suicide bombers who as it turns out

578
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,520
are apparently not the wild-eyed

579
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
ignorant religious zealots we always

580
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,640
thought

581
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
most of the studies of these fellows

582
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
show that they tend to be well-educated

583
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
well-employed reasonably sane in some

584
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
cases even secular

585
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,799
one motivation they do have in common

586
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
though is low self-esteem

587
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
a sense of humiliation they regard their

588
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
own lives as so cheapened

589
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
that those lives will gain value if they

590
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
trade them in against a higher value

591
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
target

592
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
it's a net benefit situation you might

593
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,200
say it's it's revenge economics

594
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
but this is not so much economics as it

595
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
is simple brain stem biology and that's

596
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,559
why i think that a scorched earth

597
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,280
approach irrational though it might seem

598
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,200
might actually take off it appeals

599
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
to those of us who feel powerless and

600
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,480
screwed over it

601
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,159
it appeals to those of us who really

602
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,600
want to take back some measure

603
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
of control over our lives even if it

604
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,879
costs us

605
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,799
i personally don't use cloud-based

606
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,159
services i think anyone who trusts their

607
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,480
data to the cloud is an idiot

608
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
but i would sign up for a scorched earth

609
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
service purely as a sign of political

610
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
support

611
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
i mean i'm a i'm a science fiction

612
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,000
writer by trade right

613
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,480
wild speculation is is essentially what

614
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,120
i do

615
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,520
but even i have some standards

616
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,559
you may not find the idea of a

617
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
self-destructing commercial data bank to

618
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,200
be particularly plausible

619
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
i myself think that it's at least as

620
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
likely as a world of rainbows and

621
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,039
unicorns in which the gorillas

622
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,880
set down their fiber taps and their

623
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,440
security certificates and let us gaze

624
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,360
deeply into their eyes and since most of

625
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
you have already eaten

626
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,559
that's the image i'm going to leave you

627
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,000
with

628
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,840
thank you

629
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,000
you
