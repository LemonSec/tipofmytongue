1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,640
christopher graham talked about the

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
brave new world i hope i'm not part of

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,400
the sad old world chris

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
at the heart of my career has been the

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
consumer i worked for the national

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
consumer council the office of fair

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,240
trading

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
and i was deputy chairman of which the

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,000
consumer organization throughout my

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
career quite apart from being

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,679
information commissioner it was the

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
consumer cause which really protested

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,440
against this

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
alienating approach it was which

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,960
magazine which revealed that hamlet has

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
30 066

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,559
words

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,480
shakespeare's longest play

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,120
paypal 34

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,360
798 one of our poor sad researchers had

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
to count the words

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
um it's also been revealed

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,399
yes

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,719
um microsoft does have a technology

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,079
that'll do that

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,879
exactly i know i know that i know that i

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,519
can get you a copy

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,760
i don't know how many people here signed

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,640
up to game station where seven and a

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
half thousand people assigned their

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,119
immortal soul

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,960
to a game station without reading the

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
small print

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
i don't know how many people signed up

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,640
to pc pit stop where in the small print

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,320
anyone who writes in gets a thousand

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
dollars

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
it took four months before anyone wrote

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,720
in to get their thousand dollars

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
consumers don't want to be

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,479
made to be liars

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,360
and if you tick the box which says

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
i have read

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,600
i've understood and i accept all these

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,880
words

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,520
otherwise i cannot take part in this

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
activity or have the service delivered

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
you are a liar and that is not good

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
public policy to make

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
a nation a continent a world of liars

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,439
and what's worse

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
the notice-based approach

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
i think allows far too much

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
permissiveness on the part of

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
organizations if you get a good lawyer

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,439
to write into your clauses this out of

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
the other it gives you incredible

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
freedom that is not acceptable in terms

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
of good effective regulation my slogan

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
in all of this fuel duels is effective

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,760
data protection in practice

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
pragmatism is a word which i am proud to

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
use

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,239
one of my concerns is i'm not going to

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
be attacking the european approach or

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
praising the us approach i mean here in

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
the uk we sort of look both ways and get

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
shot at from both sides so

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
we're used to that

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
but i think in some ways the european

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,879
approach

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
is too short on words

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
in some ways far too long

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
fundamental rights and freedoms that

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
phrase is used a lot both in language

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,519
and in the texts of the legislation

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
my experience the vast majority don't

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
understand what is meant by

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
fundamental rights and freedoms it's

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,959
either meaningless or ambiguous and that

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,519
includes software engineers doctors

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
policemen bankers who need to understand

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
this sort of concept

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
and yet at the same time the european

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
approach can be far too

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,440
wordy

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,159
far too i've used the word theological

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
um i started looking at the opinion the

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
article 29 opinion on legitimate

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
interest i'm sure it's packed full with

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,159
very good stuff i haven't got far i

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,480
haven't got beyond much this executive

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,519
summary but the entire opinion is 68

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,560
pages

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
of dense argument it's all good stuff

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,760
when you get into it but 68 pages is not

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
the right way to communicate what we're

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
trying to do

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
so i'm much

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
we talked i took part in this group

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
which fred and peter have mentioned and

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
if you read that you'll see a balanced

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
nuanced approach

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
aiming for effective data protection in

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
practice it is if it comes about a brave

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
new world it won't come about

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,720
immediately but i think it's signpost

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
but it does in particular signpost

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,799
a greater emphasis on use it's not as

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,439
peter said an abandonment of a focus on

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
collection but it tries to look at

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
what's happening in reality not just

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
what might be happening not just at the

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
collection stage and it does try to

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,400
articulate the fundamental rights and

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
freedoms in terms of harms and risk

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
and most of you know i'm now with the

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
center for information policy leadership

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,120
we pioneered the work on accountability

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
and we now have a project which is

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,440
underway on what is really meant by a

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
risk-based approach and i talked to a

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
small workshop here on tuesday about

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
that it's still very much work in

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
progress we've drawn upon the work which

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
the canil in france did on risk

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
methodology on the work which uh chris

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
and my former colleagues in a very

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
non-bureaucratic environment uh have

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
been doing on privacy impact assessments

131
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
and and so on and essentially what we're

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
trying to say is that we need to

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
communicate what this privacy protection

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
is all about and trying to identify

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
tangible harms whether that's bodily

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,800
harm

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
loss of liberty loss of freedom of

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
movement

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
damage to earning power significant

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
damage to economic interests

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,280
they're moving on to the intangibles

142
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,199
reputational harm

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
detriment from the monitoring or

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
exposure of identity characteristics or

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
activities

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
fear anxiety or embarrassment arising

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
from unacceptable intrusion into family

148
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,199
life

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,080
discrimination and stigmatization trying

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
to bring these to life are not as

151
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
concrete perhaps as they might be in

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,400
some respects but trying to bring a more

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,199
objective contextual approach and not

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,759
last but not least societal harm where

155
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
there can be damage to the democratic

156
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,800
institutions of nations or continents or

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,960
loss of social trust where people don't

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
know who knows what about whom

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,199
and what we're trying to do is bring

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
more concrete pragmatic language into

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
the debate and make that the focus of

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
regulation and the final word i use

163
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
because it's relevant to all this it's a

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,039
phrase i have used before once or twice

165
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
selective to be effective it has to be

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
about prioritization it has to be

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
looking at those areas where there is

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
the greatest risk the most

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
most likely that substantial significant

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,919
harm is going to be caused to consumers

171
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,479
