1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,469
one of the interesting realities of the

2
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:12,330
60 some-odd page opinion around

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,520
legitimate used legitimate purpose was a

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,740
very positive I thought discussion of

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,880
the fact that there are times where

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,609
benefits or legitimate interest of a

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,949
business or controller can be considered

8
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,499
quite significant perhaps even though

9
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,689
you don't have some of the other basis

10
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,260
for for processing presumably consent or

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,989
other issues should I not get too

12
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,640
excited Yakko that this is some

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,309
increased appreciation from data

14
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,550
regulators for a benefit and risk

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,660
approach and with sort of that backdrop

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,750
how does that opinion or sort of your

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,739
concerns about this effort to shift

18
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,620
focus clashes with some of the basic

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,290
concerns or is it compatible and and are

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,900
we simply talking about messaging are we

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,380
simply to look to sort of Peters comment

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,479
that we're not changing anything here

23
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,520
we're saying we all jump up and down

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,380
about a couple of the phrases and say

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,600
this is you know the primary basis let's

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
breathe more life into principles that

27
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,060
are there but seem to have been getting

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,049
short shrift the article given us some

29
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,490
positive look that supports the the

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,170
model that we've heard about today what

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,490
are your thoughts well difficult after

32
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,399
after so many thoughts that pass to do

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,640
too so may I may I just jump to

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,189
the the fear that I have having a look

35
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,310
at the work that has been done and and

36
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,210
still is being done by Brianna and and

37
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,970
and Richard is the fear that I got when

38
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,520
I visited Silicon Valley okay I was

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,650
there with Peter Hastings and people

40
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,170
looked at me as as their grand

41
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,030
grandfather because they were all but

42
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,989
the end very short they said it's

43
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,209
interesting what you're saying but our

44
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,530
business model is against it now if

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,400
that's the key point in what these

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,150
gentlemen are doing that I'm against it

47
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,180
because the principle based approach of

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,040
privacy and I'm not going to go through

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,660
these principles right now would be too

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,579
time-consuming and I'm not sure whether

51
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:55,720
I would be complete and need some 34,000

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,660
Shakespeare words in on earth over it

53
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,180
but the principle based approach of the

54
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,269
European our regulation anyway and

55
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,510
directive is one that is very forceful

56
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,239
and and stood the test of time pretty

57
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,400
well I would think there's a couple of

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,530
things that we must change absolutely

59
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,040
but not get rid of these principles now

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,190
there's one misunderstanding reading the

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:33,250
the the the several pieces of paper that

62
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,010
were much shorter than our legitimate

63
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,769
interest opinion by the way but come

64
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,799
close to it is that the that that the

65
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,799
the notice and choice model in fact is a

66
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,409
very US based model not talking too much

67
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,989
about fundamental rights and stuff like

68
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,470
that

69
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,790
we have you need a legal ground and come

70
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,010
to work with data anyway and and the

71
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,250
consent is only one of them and not even

72
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,239
the most important one long legal

73
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,260
notices will most likely not even lead

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,990
to valid consent as far as the European

75
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,650
legislation is concerned so I'm fully

76
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,310
with all of you saying that we have to

77
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,610
shift responsibility because who the

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,390
hell as normal citizen would understand

79
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,200
what he's saying yes to I mean this

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,420
technology behind all this is too

81
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,530
complicated to to grasp and so that

82
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,740
accountability comes in a risk

83
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,290
assessment comes in is is is a very good

84
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,470
is excellent and his working party

85
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,970
starting the discussion on the lid on

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,919
the new regulation we embraced the

87
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,040
risk-based approach not only because in

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,110
the directive there's four or five

89
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,500
articles that already hint towards that

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,350
risk-based approach so it's not it's not

91
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,750
completely new so I could say more about

92
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,740
that but let me let me end up with two

93
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,220
remarks the vs yes our legitimate

94
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,630
interest opinion is not very short and

95
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,919
and maybe not too easy to read my advice

96
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,950
to avoid on and monday was just read the

97
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,490
last 67 pages and and you got the

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,200
essence and and I think all of you

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,479
should read it because legitimate

100
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,660
interest until now hasn't been used that

101
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,370
much because it's a balancing test where

102
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,510
you need to balance the interest of the

103
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,960
company to its the

104
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,000
until right of the citizens and a

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,150
balancing test generally isn't a one

106
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,770
size fits all fits old decision a

107
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,000
balancing test requires everyone to

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,419
think a little bit and generally in life

109
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,910
people are very much against that so

110
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,590
that's why I think that legitimate

111
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,919
interest isn't used very much in it it

112
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,990
might be very helpful in the discussion

113
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,830
to take on board that part because it is

114
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,320
really what we think is the best way of

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,120
thinking right now there's six legal

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,460
grounds one of them being legitimate

117
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,080
interest I'd have a look at it because

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,759
then probably things like risks even

119
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,550
somewhat more looking at the use and and

120
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,070
and maybe less at the collection and

121
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,340
sexual though I'm very much doubtful if

122
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,190
if we go that way it might be a slippery

123
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,930
slope that when the end we're only

124
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,659
looking at use and not you looking at

125
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,360
collection anymore collection once it is

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,990
collected and there's always a guy or a

127
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,599
woman who will think we can use it for a

128
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,199
complete other direction and so

129
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,360
collection is still if if it's going to

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,919
be a fundamental right collection is

131
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,960
also falls on it and finally and come

132
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,259
back to my first remark if it is if this

133
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,500
all thinking is because the middle the

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,599
business model doesn't fit into the

135
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,889
regulation or into the principles of

136
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,820
data protection then then I'll stay very

137
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,770
ceptable about the outcome
