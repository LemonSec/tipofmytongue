1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,190
my motivation inspiration for radar was

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,620
really seeing firsthand our customers

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,559
struggle with dealing and managing

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
incidents once they occurred there was

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,820
really no good technology in tools at

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,369
their disposal to help them manage that

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,350
very challenging and risky product

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,740
process so what we did was we knew that

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,080
there had to be a better way in the

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,720
breach response business it's stressful

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,510
there's a patchwork of state and federal

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,149
laws it's complicated and that can be

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,149
difficult for people to work in making

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,090
radar helps those people in their

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,469
day-to-day lives it makes it simple for

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,440
them we are solving a real pain point

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,210
when I've talked to customers and they

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,899
say they do a 60 step process to to

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,469
regulate to to document in to go through

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,320
an incident I just go wow we're making

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,870
people's lives better we knew that if we

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,090
brought innovation software modeling

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,129
capabilities to bear that we could

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,539
actually solve this problem very

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,700
effectively and that's what we have done

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,970
exactly with greater

27
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,030
you
