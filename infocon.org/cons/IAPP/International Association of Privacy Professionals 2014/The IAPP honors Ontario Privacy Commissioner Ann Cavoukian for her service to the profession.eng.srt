1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,219
and and it's actually with a little bit

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,580
of that sadness that I'm up here to make

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,680
a sort of small little presentation I'm

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,889
saddened because for years and years and

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:18,500
years we've had the IEP p Canada

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,290
symposium and we've always had the

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,200
terrific participation of a lot of

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Commissioners over the years and last

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,460
year in this year marked a real changing

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,200
of the guard at the commissioner level

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,820
and we saw Chantal Bernie take over for

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,329
Jennifer Stoddart and then Saskatchewan

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,430
and in Nova Scotia the commissioners

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,380
have left their blows those positions

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,920
and this year marks the last year that

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,660
we're going to have Commissioner kabuki

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,130
and join us in her capacity as

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,180
commissioner and and so I think it's

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,750
only fitting that we take a moment and

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,270
and and thank Commissioner kabuki and

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,360
for all her support energy and time that

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,110
she's put into educating us entertaining

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,149
us and providing us with a wealth of

24
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:11,450
information over the years well I think

25
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,090
for me one of the very first things that

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,259
comes to mind is is energetic energy in

27
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,429
fact I'm quite sure that energizer toy

28
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:25,039
between maybe going with an kabuki and

29
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:29,240
instead of the Energizer Bunny real

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,299
powerhouse power had a house and she's

31
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,549
she's also an exceptional public speaker

32
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,719
and whether or not it's on a small panel

33
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,560
discussion or as a keynote commissioner

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,779
Cavoukian has always been able to sort

35
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:48,590
of entertain and wow us with a great

36
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,349
style and a great energy Commissioner

37
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,880
Kuehne vegan has a great sense of humor

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,009
and we've seen this because I force her

39
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,789
every year to play that game show and

40
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,669
and I let her off the hook this year but

41
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,739
we'll see we'll see what capacity I can

42
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,639
get her back here in future years

43
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:10,490
definitely say what you will about her

44
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,470
tenure the one thing that really is

45
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,560
remarkable is how effective

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,099
he was as a commissioner she she

47
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,590
absolutely would not stop at anything to

48
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,150
get the result that she thought was

49
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,340
right and and in particular if you think

50
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,989
about just how effective she was in

51
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,599
terms of her investigations her report

52
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,170
her studies her white papers just just

53
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,349
think alone how much Ryerson is going to

54
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,239
be able to take advantage of her ability

55
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,989
to brand things because I mean everybody

56
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,170
knows pbd everybody knows PPD and that's

57
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,049
that's thanks to Hank lukien she's

58
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,549
definitely somebody who's pushed the

59
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,340
envelope she's never let her critics

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,380
stand in her way and she's always been

61
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,819
able to fight for what she thought was

62
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,209
the just result in the end I think you

63
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,099
would all agree with me that there is no

64
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,769
truer privacy champion than Commissioner

65
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,160
Cavoukian and I'd like to us now all to

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,099
thank her for her years of of helping us

67
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,739
out here at the IPP and I asked her to

68
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,360
join me on the stage and accept this

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,980
little gift that we have for her

70
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,520
so

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,689
thank you so much Chris thank you so

72
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,209
much for those very kind words I'm so

73
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,109
grateful and I'm I've such mixed mixed

74
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,840
emotions because I I know this is the

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,289
right time three terms is I think more

76
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,029
than anyone should be doing quite

77
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,209
frankly because you want to leave well

78
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,740
hopefully you still think you're

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,440
effective and you can do the work that

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
you need to do and in this day and age

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
post Snowden revelations there is so

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
much going on not only in terms of

83
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,560
surveillance but the enormous

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,889
requirement to protect privacy in the

85
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,699
broadest way we did a panel this morning

86
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,780
where we were talking about the

87
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,509
essential the essential need to preserve

88
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,660
control in the hands of individuals

89
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,900
because privacy is all about personal

90
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,970
control and freedom of choice and as the

91
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,199
Germans say informational

92
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,720
self-determination this is what it's

93
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,190
about this is why it's linked so

94
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,680
strongly to freedom and liberty and this

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,320
is what we have to grow never in a

96
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,659
zero-sum way never to the exclusion of

97
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,909
other very invaluable interests such as

98
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,759
big data and research and business

99
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,169
interests and the whole environment can

100
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,720
be addressed but we have to weave

101
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,889
privacy into the process in this

102
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,880
positive some win-win manner so I'm i

103
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,430
think the time to to move on is is this

104
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,190
time but as you know given that privacy

105
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,440
is my life I'm not leaving it and I I

106
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,539
hope to do continue the work at Ryerson

107
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,520
at the Big Data Institute which I should

108
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,320
tell you is the only big data Institute

109
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,060
in the world that is branded with

110
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,009
privacy so as the privacy and big data

111
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,900
Institute in this win-win manner so we

112
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,340
hope to continue the work there in the

113
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,050
research and I look forward to working

114
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,820
with any of you if you're interested in

115
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,979
collaborating and partnering let's talk

116
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,570
let me just take a moment first to thank

117
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,139
the amazing people in my life my office

118
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,889
has just been such a force

119
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,280
and you may be able to surmise that I'm

120
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,770
not the easiest person to work for

121
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,770
because I'm very demanding and I Drive

122
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,650
the people in my office crazy on a

123
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,050
regular basis as I Drive myself crazy so

124
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,169
it it is constant the pressure is

125
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,840
ongoing and it doesn't stop and

126
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,120
literally that's that's the way it has

127
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,050
been almost from day one so to the

128
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,819

investigate the trish coin this

145
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,719
wonderful investigation we did recently

146
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,509
called crossing the line all about how

147
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,229
is it that someone's attempted suicide

148
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,819
information could be in the hands of

149
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,229
border crossing officials are you

150
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,560
kidding me when that story broke we just

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,899
we couldn't believe it and the first

152
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,120
thing of course we had to make sure was

153
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,039
not the case that we had to make sure

154
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,080
wasn't our Ministry of Health who has

155
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
everyone's health information of course

156
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,710
so we had to nail that down immediately

157
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,860
and we did and as soon as the minister

158
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,539
of health called me and told me it's not

159
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,120
us we've done a complete audit it is not

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,759
us and she was wonderful and I thanked

161
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,469
her profusely and then I said Minister

162
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,210
Matthews one more thing and please

163
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,680
understand why I'm asking for this I

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,750
need a sworn affidavit from you to that

165
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,120
effect because on this one I can't do a

166
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,250
trust me I need to lay the fears of the

167
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,979
public that their health information is

168
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,509
safe at the Ministry of Health and to

169
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,819
her enormous credit she understood why i

170
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,080
was asking for that and she gave it to

171
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
me so these are just some of the tales

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
we have so many there are so many

173
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,709
pressing issues that we have to continue

174
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,850
for

175
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,500
but most of all I have to thank someone

176
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,530
who has been my inspiration and my

177
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,780
strength over all these years and

178
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,610
without whom I couldn't do any of this

179
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,210
and he knows who he is and I thank him

180
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,610
profusely from the bottom of my heart

181
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,760
and I am probably the luckiest person in

182
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,839
the world because I have the most

183
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,820
wonderful meaningful work that I love

184
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,339
doing and I have the most wonderful life

185
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,130
with this wonderful individual so it's a

186
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,380
real win-win as always positive sum all

187
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,790
the way thank you so much for this
