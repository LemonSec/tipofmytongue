1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,019
our next keynote will take the form of

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,469
an interview with Jennifer Baker

3
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:20,430
interviewing max schrems okay well

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,470
there's a breakout session later this

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,019
afternoon which max will be in and he is

6
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,689
described as one in a billion and we're

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,949
all invited to get to know the man

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,410
behind the headlines so presumably when

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,329
you start with this you had no idea you

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,100
were going to end up making new rules

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,739
for Europe no not at all like pretty

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,540
much the whole Facebook thing started

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,250
because I was were studying in the u.s.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,989
half a year and there was a guy from

15
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,289
Facebook telling us that basically the

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,030
story was you can break European law

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,890
because nothing ever it's ever gonna

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,160
happen which was really true currently

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,370
and that led into a little experiment of

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,940
is our law actually enforceable and I

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,350
never thought it's gotta be a big thing

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,640
at the beginning we're just putting

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,430
facts up on the website what we got from

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,350
Facebook a little complaints in our land

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,580
were drafted over two nights and

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,630
suddenly you're like in this whole

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,610
privacy debate in the end I mean do you

28
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,380
ever wish that it wasn't Facebook that

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,460
maybe there would have been a different

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,780
target that might have been easier -

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,430
yeah like we never expected it to be

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,049
public thing so Facebook is not really a

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,090
good target for a public thing because

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,950
everyone is telling you you you know

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,540
you're free to join it not to join it so

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,280
it's really not from a PR standpoint it

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
was not a wise decision but it was not a

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,970
decision it was just the first one that

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,729
came up but it was interesting to see

40
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,890
how things are enforceable and where the

41
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,200
practical problems are because we have a

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,299
nice law in Europe on paper but we're

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,280
actually not doing anything about it and

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,720
I think that's the big problem in the

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,750
Penn the transatlantic debate is that

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,430
we're usually pointing at the u.s.

47
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,060
saying that's the evil prism empire the

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,130
googles and whatever but the factual

49
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,689
problem is that we're not enforcing all

50
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,979
law right now and I wouldn't stick to

51
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,869
the law either if it's actually not

52
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,280
enforced like an island where you get an

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,110
enforcement notice as like the worst

54
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,880
thing that can happen to you which is a

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,890
little letter saying dear Facebook don't

56
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,360
do that kisses your data protection

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,099
commissioner that's actually what you

58
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,060
get there

59
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,430
okay you brought up the iris Data

60
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,569
Protection Commissioner we spoke a

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,069
little bit before we came on stage about

62
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,340
that you have some sort of quite

63
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,080
interesting views on their efficacy

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,060
shall we put it that way your

65
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,450
independence I think on independence is

66
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,250
one issue I think we have a huge problem

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,440
in practice if it's not after the DP

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,819
sees are independent mainly because they

69
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,290
also overlooked the government there

70
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,640
makes a lot of sense to be independent

71
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,880
and what we saw in practice was that the

72
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,930
governments are saying it's an

73
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,090
independent body we're not able to

74
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,190
intervene and then they independently

75
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,570
put someone there that doesn't do

76
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,360
anything and that's something we see now

77
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,100
more and more in different countries and

78
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,870
we have the same problem for example in

79
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,430
Sweden where a complaint that we filed

80
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,400
was just not ever touched for the

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,780
reasons that they feel they don't want

82
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,519
to touch it and you have to prom that

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,150
you don't have any political no and no

84
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,980
political responsibility because there

85
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,420
is just no government body that's

86
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,920
responsible for it it's an independent

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,420
office they can do whatever they want to

88
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,069
do and especially in Ireland you had two

89
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,690
problem that the legal oversight is so

90
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,400
expensive that even companies are not

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,620
going after the DPC even if companies

92
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,459
get insane rulings the thing I got from

93
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,019
most lawyers in Ireland was that even

94
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,000
companies are not going after them at a

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,860
high court on the whole procedure that

96
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,750
there is because it's just so insanely

97
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,820
expensive it's even more expensive for a

98
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,650
consumer like me we were able because

99
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,100
there was a lot of a lot of media on

100
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,590
that that we had a clam crowdfunding

101
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,170
platform we got about 60,000 euro but

102
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,060
that's an exception I can do that but

103
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,340
most average users are unable to do that

104
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,290
and that's prob why for example right

105
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,239
now at the TPC in Ireland the last

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,230
numbers from Billy Hawks time was that

107
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,120
only two to four percent of all the

108
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,620
complaints that were filed with the TPC

109
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,720
were actually getting decided all the

110
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,489
others were informally resolved and I

111
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,530
know ours were informally resolved by

112
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,359
sending an email back saying we don't do

113
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,549
anything you go to the courts if you're

114
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,739
unhappy with it so we have a very

115
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,269
serious enforcement problem and I think

116
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,070
that's that's the thing that hopefully

117
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,170
the new regulation is gonna about as

118
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,790
well well of course if the new

119
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,728
regulation goes through in its current

120
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,829
form we've got this one-stop-shop issue

121
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,870
and Ireland then becomes the center

122
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,550
point and you know we all laugh about

123
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,180
the pictures

124
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,060
that little office in Portland but I

125
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,830
mean what's I mean are you alarmed by

126
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,080
that I mean and in principle the

127
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
one-stop shop I think that work in

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,740
principle there dr4 one-stop shop makes

129
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,030
a lot of sense because as a company I

130
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,050
don't want to have twenty eight data

131
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,190
production commissioners that have

132
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,410
different opinions that is something

133
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,580
that makes a lot of sense the problem

134
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,380
from a consumer perspective is I'm able

135
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,690
to speak English but a lot of the people

136
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,880
in other countries have especially in

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,190
Europe have low understanding of English

138
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,960
especially if it comes to legal text so

139
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,340
if that is really the only place where

140
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,780
you can file a complaint only in the

141
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,039
national language you have a serious

142
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,570
problem and usually in consumer

143
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,099
contracts we have the fact that you can

144
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,539
always go to your local court so the

145
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,949
idea of having a cooperation between

146
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,500
your local DPC and whoever is the

147
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,970
one-stop shop makes a lot of sense I

148
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,220
don't know what the exact position right

149
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,990
now is in the in the council and I don't

150
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,340
know what the final version is going to

151
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,169
be but I think somewhere along that

152
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,150
lines that is kind of what makes sense a

153
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,770
lot we also had the problem that we have

154
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,599
actually in Europe for the big companies

155
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,500
in a private sector

156
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,330
trudi pcs that are responsible that's

157
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,039
Island and Luxembourg for text reasons

158
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,090
all these companies are having

159
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,650
headquartered in these two countries

160
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,320
pretty much and they have a huge burden

161
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,729
and they also have a lot of pressure

162
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,250
from the public to not scare away the

163
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,930
companies you've just attracted by the

164
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,720
tax regime so there is a certain thing

165
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,419
that it makes sense that other countries

166
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,130
also involved in in the decision process

167
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,220
I guess okay well I mean we sort of

168
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,840
talked about you know you're a versus

169
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,370
Facebook but can you break it down I

170
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,199
mean there's sort of three strands to

171
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,729
what you're doing is the Irish procedure

172
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,430
the ECJ and then you should talk a

173
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,690
little bit more about that and the class

174
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,000
action so just give us an outline of

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,650
what direction in one of the next steps

176
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,180
with each of those like we have to first

177
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,430
what was the 22 complaints at the DPC

178
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,930
which always sounds like a big number we

179
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,400
just split up every little button on

180
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,990
Facebook as an individual complaint to

181
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,479
makes it easier to process these 22

182
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,889
complaints were taken back this summer

183
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,380
because after three years were at the

184
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,880
Irish TPC we have the problem that we're

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,500
not allowed to see the evidence we're

186
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,810
not allowed to see the fouls of the case

187
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,130
we're not even allowed to see the

188
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,050
counter-arguments by facebook so was a

189
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,909
two-party procedure but one of the two

190
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,250
parties was when I sent an email I got

191
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,690
the answer back that they do not respond

192
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,919
to the email if you call them to tell

193
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,150
you that you should send them an email

194
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,259
because you're not allowed to talk to

195
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,280
you

196
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,620
and they were just totally shutting down

197
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,760
the only option we had was filing loads

198
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,730
of jr's traditional reviews against the

199
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,910
Irish TPC which just didn't pay off so

200
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,380
in the end we had to from that for

201
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,210
example I was talking back then to Gary

202
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,130
Davis device data protection

203
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,420
commissioner in Ireland who is now

204
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,800
working for Apple interestingly but the

205
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,320
the fun thing was that I said you know I

206
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,790
don't know what the artists procedure is

207
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,250
but under European law you have access

208
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,750
to the files of your case that's one of

209
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,280
the most basic principles ever since

210
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,070
even in case law system and like ever

211
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,950
they are ever since and the answer I was

212
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,260
in at least article 6 of the European

213
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,490
Convention of Human Rights for failed

214
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,270
trial and the answer from from him was

215
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,500
article 6 doesn't apply to us

216
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,110
and I was like article 6 European

217
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,250
Convention of Human Rights doesn't apply

218
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,400
to port or Lincoln or you know what why

219
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,810
and the answer was we don't tell you why

220
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,820
and that was really the point where a

221
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,340
friend of mine who was a lawyer as well

222
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,720
he was freaked out like the train ride

223
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,250
back to Dublin he was like are we

224
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,050
somewhere in bloody Boston what's going

225
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,570
on here so we really had serious doubts

226
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,630
about the independence or whatever it is

227
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,250
in Ireland we don't have any evidence

228
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,870
I'll usually leave it up to the

229
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,390
journalists to make up their mind why

230
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,979
that is but really saw that they're just

231
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,620
not willing to enforce anything then the

232
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,900
second string was the prison complaint

233
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,460
which we filed later because I got

234
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,380
journalists journalists asking me if the

235
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,240
whole prison thing can be legal from a

236
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,710
European perspective that Facebook

237
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,900
Ireland sends data then to the US which

238
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,500
is then used for the prison program and

239
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,720
I was researching it for half a day and

240
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
I was like no like if actually no

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,830
because it runs after safe harbor and

242
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,380
safe harbor at least on the legal basis

243
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,780
falls under the higher ranking law of

244
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,810
article seven and eight of the Charter

245
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,180
and article 25 of the directive says

246
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,830
that it has to be an adequate protection

247
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,390
in the US and I was like mass

248
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,729
surveillance of all my content is surely

249
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,919
not an adequate protection

250
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,270
the fun thing was that the Irish tpc

251
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,159
first said that they do not have to

252
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,539
investigate complaints so they just

253
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,450
don't feel like investigating it then

254
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm not a native English speaker but I

255
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,050
was like according to the Oxford

256
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,450
English dictionary Shaul in the law

257
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,790
means that you must that's like as an

258
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,950
Austrian speaking here so they finally

259
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,630
decided that they must but that my

260
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,410
complaint was frivolous and vexatious

261
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,880
because my legal view that this is not

262
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,589
an adequate protection was frivolous and

263
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,720
vexatious which allowed them to get rid

264
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,829
of the complaint without ever

265
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:08,430
investigating it and the fun thing was

266
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,290
that my frivolous and vexatious legal

267
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,640
viewpoint was the same that the

268
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,990
Commission has taken the European

269
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,640
Parliament has taken that the article 29

270
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
working group has taken so apparently

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
all of these institutions were frivolous

272
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,750
and vexatious according to the Irish TPC

273
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,040
that went then to the High Court and was

274
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,649
now referred to the ECJ which i think is

275
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,060
going to be a very interesting case we

276
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,040
now now roughly know what the different

277
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,769
parties are saying we will go on a

278
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,360
head-on collision with safe harbor and

279
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,430
say safe harbor was ever since invalid

280
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,260
400 reasons all these reasons we know

281
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,670
that are out there because we're the

282
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,870
only ones they could ever bring them up

283
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,959
to the ECJ others will not bring it up

284
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,430
another stream of arguments is that

285
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,170
article 3 of the safe harbor applies

286
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,690
which allows in specific situations to

287
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,790
suspend data flows to individual

288
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,320
companies that's pretty much what a lot

289
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,079
of the member states are arguing the

290
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,899
European Parliament argues that this

291
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,450
cannot be the case but not specifying

292
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,240
why we know that Austria has argued as

293
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,070
well and Slovenia and they're pretty

294
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,130
much on our side the Commission seems to

295
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,589
try to kind of wind its way out of it um

296
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,649
we'll see how that turns out but it's

297
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,329
very interesting because after the digit

298
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:16,709
right silent case we have a very good

299
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,250
case we can save data retention in

300
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,079
Europe which is only metadata for six

301
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,050
months it's disproportionate and content

302
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,540
data forever it's like off the scale

303
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,279
it's not anywhere close to being

304
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,770
proportionate so to overcome that

305
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,990
problem will be interesting I really

306
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,310
have to trouble that I wanted to come up

307
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,290
to the ECJ with a solution to the whole

308
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,970
problem as well that was the reason

309
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,529
where I was also in DC and was like do

310
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,209
you have any clue how we can possibly

311
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,220
solve the problem and right now I don't

312
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,430
see it I think for the ECJ case they're

313
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,260
kind of three options either they see CJ

314
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,120
finds his way out to kind of find some

315
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
formal reason not to decide about the

316
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,779
thing which they tend to do if they feel

317
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,760
like it

318
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,110
and then there is the article three

319
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,240
argument which i think is the most

320
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,790
likely outcome but has a huge problem

321
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,440
for safe harbor in practice because then

322
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,139
every little DPC which there are 31

323
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,600
countries plus germany has like i think

324
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,120
16 d pcs or something every individual

325
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,980
GPC can tell you you're not allowed to

326
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,170
bring it to the google cloud and then

327
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,750
you have each TPC suspending data flows

328
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,760
in all Member States so I think safe

329
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,110
harbor in that case would be Swiss

330
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,730
cheese that would need to be fixed right

331
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,470
away anyways and then you have the

332
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,600
possibility of a suspension of safe

333
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,399
harbor in itself which possibly you can

334
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,649
only do by saying there's gonna be a

335
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,240
transition period of a year or two or

336
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,430
something like that which would give the

337
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,410
chance to renegotiate it in some way I

338
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,600
think that's the most reasonable things

339
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,430
that could possibly come out but it's

340
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,320
the Supreme Court of Europe so you never

341
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,019
really know where the end results are

342
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,790
gonna lay but that's kind of these

343
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,949
dreams you see right there the third

344
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,660
thing that we did right now is the class

345
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,130
action in Austria which is kind of

346
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,630
coming from the Irish procedure because

347
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,910
we decided DPC in Ireland we're not

348
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,730
gonna go anywhere with that and I have

349
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,829
the option as a consumer to sue at my

350
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,130
home court classical European consumer

351
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,490
law so we filed a individual consumer

352
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,170
complaint in Vienna I always wanted to

353
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,420
do that right away and we later decided

354
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,459
that in Austria it's possible to form a

355
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,740
class action by assignment so we have a

356
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,889
monetary request of damages of 500 bucks

357
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,019
in our case against Facebook we try to

358
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,790
stay as low as possible to make the

359
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,170
point that we're not after money but

360
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,769
about the principle and what you can do

361
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,300
is that you assign your monetary claim

362
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,250
to the actual claimant that's already

363
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,529
there and thereby former class action so

364
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,839
it's actually a two-party procedure but

365
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,760
you can actually legally represent or

366
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,290
actually represent twenty five thousand

367
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,870
people in our case that's that was done

368
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,490
through an assignment app that was kind

369
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,220
of cool I wasn't a web app that you

370
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,199
could pull on your on your smartphone

371
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,850
and you had to login with Facebook

372
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,319
because we had to verify that you have a

373
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:55,769
Facebook account take a picture of your

374
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,800
ID so we verify it's a real person and

375
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,269
then fill out a couple of forms it was

376
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:02,279
interesting cuz it took people on

377
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,410
average 10 to 15 minutes to fill it out

378
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,660
and taking a picture of your ID and

379
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,399
uploading it to a webpage is really a

380
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,029
lot to ask for

381
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,449
and we still have 25,000 people signing

382
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,369
up your claim within six days then we

383
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:16,929
shut it down because we were like it's

384
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,519
out of proportion I have to administer

385
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,129
it myself because I'm doing that as a

386
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,679
individual consumer I also don't get any

387
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,829
money for it because I got the same 500

388
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:29,499
boxes everybody else is getting so we

389
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,470
stopped with the 25,000 but we got

390
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,329
another 50,000 people that just

391
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,819
registered to be later joined possibly

392
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:39,369
so you see how there's a huge kind of

393
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,259
interested in in it and it was

394
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,639
interesting because a lot of people even

395
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,989
emailed us that they don't want to have

396
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,879
their 500 bucks they want to donate it

397
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,799
to someone else to just want to kind of

398
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,799
have the rights enforced we also got the

399
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,499
response from Facebook last week which

400
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,529
was very interesting they brought up

401
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:57,909
actually I mean that's what you

402
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,709
technically do they brought up a hundred

403
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,289
reasons why this class action is not to

404
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:04,119
be certified so to say there's a

405
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,699
different German German but kind of the

406
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,679
whole thing was this is impossible and

407
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,269
you can never sue Facebook that was kind

408
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:12,789
of the general argument you can't even

409
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,379
go to courts against them that is kind

410
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,259
of clear no the fun thing is one of two

411
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,909
things is the competence they've even

412
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:21,099
argued that their own users are not

413
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,929
competent to assign your claim because

414
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,549
they're legally incompetent which you

415
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:26,409
can only be in Austria if you going

416
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,639
insane which is interesting cuz to claim

417
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,629
25,000 of their own users have

418
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,229
apparently gone insane because obviously

419
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,729
a couple of years earlier they were able

420
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:39,999
to sign their privacy policy so I was

421
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,589
arguing if possibly Facebook makes you

422
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,279
go insane but yeah it's it's a bunch of

423
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,349
really interesting arguments it's really

424
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:48,970
wonderful if you want to have a PR thing

425
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,229
after that you just take their own

426
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,759
arguments put it out to the media and

427
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,999
you have the best laugh ever and that's

428
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,679
gonna be very interesting cuz there we

429
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,749
have the whole prison thing and NSA and

430
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:00,669
Big Data in it as well

431
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:02,739
so that has a high chance to go up to

432
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:05,889
the ECJ at some point as well and what's

433
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,419
interesting is what we did in that case

434
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,459
and that was legally really an

435
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,470
interesting thing and if any I mean a

436
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,839
lot of company people are in here if you

437
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,379
have a look at the terms you have

438
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,779
because what made the biggest fun for us

439
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:21,609
was that they claimed that California

440
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:23,350
law applies

441
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,790
if you want to have towards California

442
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,410
law is the smartest thing you can

443
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,260
possibly give your consumer and that's

444
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,240
pretty much our argument we made in that

445
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,610
case is that we say we have damages

446
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,710
under Irish law concerning Irish

447
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,600
controller we have a contract with an

448
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Irish company so European data

449
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,740
protection law applies there's a cause

450
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,410
of action and article 23 22 after a

451
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,990
directive and then in Irish law and this

452
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,730
cause of action I can then use under

453
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,950
California law to make a color fornear

454
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,020
tort claim so we have a hybrid we have a

455
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,740
hybrid between European privacy law and

456
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,210
California tort law and it's only

457
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,620
because of the terms of Facebook that

458
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,660
were able to do that I was like they

459
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,040
have never had any I mean they pretty

460
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,260
much took a California terms and

461
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,940
translated into German and thought that

462
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,130
that's workable in Europe which is

463
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,990
wonderful if you do that cuz you as a

464
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,640
consumer in Europe you can kind of pick

465
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,010
the jurisdiction you that are is more

466
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,810
favorable to you I can choose Austrian

467
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,670
jurisdiction or California and whatever

468
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,230
the case is I take the jurisdiction

469
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,260
makes more fun yeah in that case you

470
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,660
even have that hybrid situation and you

471
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,100
can file the whole thing in Austria so

472
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,290
you aren't so I was like that's

473
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,030
wonderful and that was the only reason

474
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,590
why we actually did the class action I

475
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,180
I'm through at Facebook I personally

476
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,770
don't care about Facebook as a company

477
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,570
or anything I was some kind of through

478
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,900
with the privacy debate but that class

479
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,850
action and how the law worked together

480
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,340
that well was like I have to follow

481
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,710
there's no worry we're not doing that if

482
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,880
you want to know more about the class

483
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,590
action all our files also the class

484
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,970
action is on our web page to download

485
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,740
it's kind of interesting how we argued

486
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,180
it legally the other thing we also

487
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,310
argued was unjust enrichment which i

488
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,470
think is gonna be a new path you can

489
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,250
take saying that they like illegally use

490
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,550
our data and make a certain amount of

491
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,189
money off of it which is quite kind of

492
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,390
the typical thing of unjust enrichment

493
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,540
in most jurisdictions and that's kind of

494
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,160
an interesting path to go down this well

495
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,130
to get a monetary claim of course in the

496
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,300
case of facebook it's gonna be a couple

497
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,010
of cents per users or not read the big

498
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,230
books but the interesting thing is under

499
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,030
austrian procedural law is they have to

500
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,560
come up with the number of how much

501
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,660
money they're making on each user which

502
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,370
has got to be very interesting to ask

503
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,070
and i was already talking to privacy

504
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,500
peoples that are gonna have a Firefox

505
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,120
sticker it tells you how much money

506
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,910
making right now when you're on Facebook

507
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,830
with that information and that was kind

508
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,210
of the class action which is kind of

509
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,070
interesting I think as well because its

510
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,559
sake and really kind of consumer rights

511
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,120
to get a reprieve --i see and kind of

512
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,620
mixes in a way you really have something

513
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,559
that's enforceable for an individual

514
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,540
consumer but also for consumer groups

515
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,210
and that's I think something that we'll

516
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,830
see very likely in the future that we

517
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,780
have more consumer action like really

518
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,600
consumer groups to take that take the

519
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,520
lead we do have to add a little bit in

520
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,240
Germany right now that falafel band has

521
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,090
gone after Facebook and we do have that

522
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,440
a little more I think what we need in

523
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
the long run from an enforcement

524
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,640
perspective is to have a European

525
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,590
enforcement NGO like something on a

526
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,510
European level that really does what we

527
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,210
did on a structural level because we're

528
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,890
right now I mean we did a lot on

529
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,470
Facebook and that was just from my home

530
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,540
laptop like that's really nothing that's

531
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,920
not a structure and nothing like that

532
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,830
well you see how vulnerable they are in

533
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,470
the end and I think that is the last

534
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,210
thing I still wanna do is kind of set up

535
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,490
this European enforcement agency to kind

536
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,920
of dump the knowledge we acquired so far

537
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,960
into like I call it the shoe box that

538
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,030
should then happily flow whenever ever

539
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,550
after well I mean you've you've

540
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,320
obviously garnered a lot of support I

541
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,429
mean you were saying how pleased were

542
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:55,360
that they actually the European

543
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,030
Parliament I mean down on your side I

544
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,220
mean this comes back to sort of cultural

545
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,510
differences between the US and the EU

546
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,390
and we're told that we must protect data

547
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,390
flows at all costs what do you see is

548
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,690
the fundamental differences it's

549
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,920
interesting because I was an exchange

550
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,960
student when I was 17 in the US and

551
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,840
really the most redneck rule places in

552
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,510
Central Florida my host dad had a

553
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,720
pumpkin on his bed it was wonderful

554
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,360
but you really understand what it helps

555
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,510
me a lot to understand the US side and I

556
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,700
think a lot that a lot of the troubles

557
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,080
we have is that they're just two

558
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,929
different cultures that are so deep deep

559
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,700
down in our souls that we can hardly

560
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,590
express it that are just clashing

561
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,570
oftentimes I see that also like on on

562
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,780
the European US debate in politics a lot

563
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,270
and and I think that is kind of the key

564
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,070
for me is that I'm happily understanding

565
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,560
the US side and I just asked

566
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,120
to understand the European side as well

567
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,830
if you do business here and I think

568
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,240
that's kind of the crucial thing we have

569
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,770
to come to because we're right now more

570
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,130
in oftentimes in the debate of trying to

571
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,720
kind of convince the other side of our

572
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,000
point of view instead of trying to

573
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,240
cooperate in a way and that was I think

574
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,130
probably on the long run something

575
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,470
that's gonna be interesting and and that

576
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,450
I oftentimes see even with US officials

577
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,370
that just have a hard time to understand

578
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,410
the concept of fundamental rights in

579
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,660
Europe because and a lot of it is really

580
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,490
not legal but cultural in the background

581
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,500
so which is reach arcing from different

582
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,820
sides we even have that win in Europe

583
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,730
like to Scandinavia also like UK Ireland

584
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,560
that sometimes has very different views

585
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,420
on that and I think that is oftentimes

586
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,060
not really expressed too much and and

587
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,860
could overcome a lot of these issues but

588
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,440
for example maybe we have more of a

589
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,080
tolerance if governments or if in the US

590
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,730
the NSA is getting access to your data

591
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,500
but we're suddenly concerned if it's if

592
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,240
it's a corporate money-making entity I

593
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,590
mean do you think do you see differences

594
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,480
between government and corporates in

595
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,770
that sense I don't see that difference

596
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,270
anymore because what we see in reality

597
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,010
and that's typically prism is that we

598
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,840
have corporations going after our data

599
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,460
for monetary reasons but then the

600
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,080
government coming in and say oh you have

601
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,120
all these nice data let's get it I mean

602
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,040
that's the Microsoft case with which we

603
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,270
have in the u.s. right now where they

604
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,940
have the warrants and that's a real big

605
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,280
issue because you don't really have the

606
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,750
separation anymore you don't have the

607
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,730
government spying on you you have kind

608
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,440
of Google on your phone that spies on

609
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,060
you well enough and then the government

610
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,820
is taking it up and that's something why

611
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,950
I don't really care about government and

612
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,720
private that much anymore

613
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,940
because in the end if the government

614
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,170
wants to access something that's on a

615
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,030
private server they gotta get it one way

616
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,200
or the other either to hack into the

617
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,850
system if that's the NSA or they do

618
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,310
Pfizer and prism and whatever and get it

619
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,200
that way and therefore there is a

620
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,300
certain argument not to have your data I

621
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,670
mean it's it's typical things like I was

622
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,410
at a conference in Washington and you

623
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,870
have two 4s on your boarding pass where

624
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,750
it's a secondary security scan in scheme

625
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,700
to pulled out because you're on the list

626
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,380
and if you ask for austrian airlines

627
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,880
that are you to get that from the

628
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,230
Department of Homeland Security and they

629
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,550
have to pull you out and that whole

630
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,570
stuff

631
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,489
and that's usually something where you

632
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,600
never really know where the data comes

633
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,070
from I think in that case it was 2p in

634
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,440
our data but it's kind of interesting to

635
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,669
see how this kind of melts together even

636
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:14,619
from the CCTV that is usually run

637
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:15,970
privately but then the police is

638
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,710
accessing it we have the same thing on

639
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,109
big scale as well okay to come back to

640
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,769
Facebook again then you know this is

641
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,929
where it all started I mean in 2012

642
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,879
Facebook changed the privacy policy do

643
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,049
you think that was in reaction to what

644
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,029
you were doing we had a couple of

645
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:32,590
changes on Facebook they have to have

646
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,419
shorter retention periods which is

647
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,429
interesting custom again we are not we

648
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:37,809
don't have access to the file so we know

649
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,700
there was pretty much no retention

650
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,710
period or very long retention periods

651
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,259
and now they have a shorter one which no

652
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:45,960
one is allowed to know how long it is

653
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,749
and we had the facial recognition that

654
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:51,129
they have to turn off interestingly

655
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,399
Irish procedure again the urge Facebook

656
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,649
to do that on the consent basis even

657
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:58,629
though the article 29 working group has

658
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,539
found in the paper previously that

659
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,720
facial recognition on social networks is

660
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,590
disproportionate which was Facebook

661
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,859
don't do it just like in a abstract term

662
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,749
but it was totally targeting Facebook

663
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:12,789
and again in Ireland it was not enforced

664
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:14,950
but happily asked if they would be so

665
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,080
nice to comply with that and not do it

666
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,590
anymore

667
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,779
so in the end the result was that they

668
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:20,919
finally turned off the facial

669
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,899
recognition thing our main argument was

670
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,220
that it's totally disproportionate

671
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,340
because you saved two clicks if you mark

672
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,679
someone on a picture and therefore you

673
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,599
have facial recognition and be a

674
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,190
biometric data of 1 billion people

675
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,590
that's kind of slightly disproportionate

676
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,460
possibly and there were new privacy

677
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,489
policies twice but factually from a

678
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,720
legal perspective they were a little

679
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,399
easier to read from a consumer

680
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,950
perspective from a form but from a legal

681
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,570
perspective to just the same policy I

682
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,369
mean what we have with most of US

683
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,779
companies is that they have their

684
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,340
policies written up on the California

685
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,129
law because that's the u.s. privacy

686
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:59,049
policy law and then you just translate

687
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:01,210
it to German the promise mainly that you

688
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,749
have such abstract purposes that you can

689
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:05,979
pretty much do anything like to write

690
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,629
the old privacy policy that they just

691
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:10,570
changed last week or something once we

692
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,549
use your information to try to provide

693
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,149
this the services and functions

694
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,639
to you and others which is the purpose

695
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,080
of Facebook which means you can do

696
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,580
anything with the data because anything

697
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,349
you could possibly do as a company is a

698
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,570
service and function you provide to you

699
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,409
and others event and that is the that is

700
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,809
just where you see that they never

701
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,639
remake a I mean it was one of our main

702
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,320
arguments that the consent is invalid

703
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,999
because if that's the purpose it's very

704
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,469
likely not specific informed and

705
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:41,460
unambiguous and they you just have this

706
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,139
different approach where you still have

707
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:44,759
to feeling that things are drafted in

708
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,109
the Silicon Valley and then it's kind of

709
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,779
the Europeans are just gonna get it and

710
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,789
that's it don't worry for the European

711
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,259
law and that's really it's something

712
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,559
where I was wondering how little the how

713
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,259
little companies are investing into

714
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:01,259
being being complicit being compliant

715
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,059
with European Union law it's still

716
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,919
something that's off the scale I think

717
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,200
the the the the new penalties on the new

718
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,080
regulation will bring it up because

719
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,009
honestly in my university in California

720
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:17,580
next door we had European with European

721
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,440
competition law after the Microsoft case

722
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,119
so suddenly was important Custer was

723
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,799
money in it right now we have two

724
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,929
problem that you've actually it doesn't

725
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:28,019
pay off to be compliant right now

726
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,549
and that is something that a lot of

727
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,619
Europeans don't understand cuz this idea

728
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:33,539
of just looking at a law as a risk

729
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,580
factor which is just very much there in

730
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,769
the u.s. it's just not that much there

731
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,089
in Europe and that's something where it

732
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:40,409
is kind of this why are they all

733
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,879
sticking to all along it was like yes

734
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,989
because there's no fine so I think that

735
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:47,729
would help a lot in in the new

736
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:50,940
regulation and I hope that that's gonna

737
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,649
get us somewhere closer to compliance

738
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,759
okay

739
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,469
well I'm looking we're out of time

740
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:57,299
already and I we haven't even touched on

741
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,820
the new regulation and the risk raised

742
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,769
approach and the stuff that I had

743
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,839
written down but there is another a

744
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,460
chance to hear max this afternoon so

745
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,049
hopefully you'll be able to cover some

746
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:08,249
of the things we didn't get around to

747
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:11,219
and I think that's it for this session I

748
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:14,359
think what's lunch next
