1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,529
so for me I design cyber security in all

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,200
lots of technology problems they are

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,469
people from they are fit into the core

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,289
of how businesses are on surveillance

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,500
relative aspects like any field even is

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,800
executive who happen to be not gold they

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
don't want anyone would be there like

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,670
your slot come up

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,220
testing the rifle was intense but as

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,310
much information as they can happen when

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,480
we go to that and the biosecurity

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,820
exposed to say oh we've got this kind of

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,290
beat off the time and that's like two

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,230
feet off the back the I will be over and

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,410
now we can happen like living in the

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,840
face of the lips of one to ten

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,540
cumulative 14c of the night and

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,330
everything is new and every combination

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,230
you have is the executive piece is about

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,180
those dancing what percentage of that

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,100
happens when and delays small they

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,380
confident they clear compensate
