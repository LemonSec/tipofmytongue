1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,530
so hi everybody I'm Patrice Ettinger I'm

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,090
here to do some introductions

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,400
I'm the chief privacy officer at Pfizer

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,340
and I have the privilege of working with

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,740
ia PP to startup women leading privacy

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,110
so I get to do these really important

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,520
things like introduce our speakers today

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,279
so you you all know today's session is

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,130
about women on boards of directors and

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,770
the the idea for this session really

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,540
came out of the fact that not only is

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,640
getting women onto corporate boards a

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,400
really hot issue today but also we have

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,080
a really unique set of experience

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,620
amongst the women here at IIT P

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,820
experience and privacy and experience

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,680
and information security which really

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,020
are areas that boards are focused on

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,310
that worried about worried about

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,260
security worried about GDP are worried

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,000
about all these things that didn't use

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,220
to be board level issues and now are so

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,510
we thought it was really a great idea

24
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,310
for women here and start thinking about

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,009
what that might mean for them at any

26
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,930
stage of their career not just math

27
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,189
stuff people who might be board ready

28
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,630
but people who might want to do this ten

29
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,670
years from now 20 years from now and so

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,409

we've been on boards of the Hot Topic

68

Sheila was focused on women's ability to

69
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,600
serve on corporate boards when she

70

91

changing and with today's session is

92
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,680
we're not going to focus on quotas or

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,660
percentages of how many women are on

94
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,160
boards and so forth we're going to

95
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,620
really focus on the positive of how this

96
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,980
pendulum has swung and it's now all

97
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,320
organizations are talking about women in

98
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,570
boards so by show of hands how many of

99
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,610
you actually have read or seen of the

100
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,970
fearless girls on Wall Street right yeah

101
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,400
well you know that that was exciting so

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,010
on March 8 which was International

103
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,780
Women's Day it really started

104
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,360
heightening our senses of organizations

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,750
like State Street Global Advisors wanted

106
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,750
to see women on board so that's what

107
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,010
we're going to focus on today and having

108
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,709
Alice and Sheila here on what steps we

109
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,290
can take as women to be board ready and

110
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,070
to get board leadership so also just

111
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,450
quickly so we understand how many

112
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,430
current women are on non-for-profit

113
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:26,010
boards great how about for-profit boards

114
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,650
and how many want to be on for-profit or

115
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,360
not-for-profit boards and split it out

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,200
mr. smooth it out oh let's split up yeah

117
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,610
yeah how many want to be on

118
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,780
not-for-profit boards how many want to

119
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,110
be on for-profit board great yeah well

120
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,840
great so of Alice so we hear quite often

121
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,790
you know the past two corporate board

122
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,380
leadership sometimes starts from the

123
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,300
non-for-profit board leadership and I

124
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,040
can tell you from my personal experience

125
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,350
I know that I want to be on a corporate

126
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,680
board and but I didn't know kind of the

127
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,610
fundamentals I didn't know about board

128
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,710
governance I didn't even know how board

129
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,960
meetings were run so I decided to learn

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,210
about the governance and also share with

131
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,770
my passion of women and children and

132
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,130
start by a non-for-profit and I did I

133
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,380
started learning about you know what

134
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,390
board packages were and you know what

135
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,120
board governance were was so can you

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,640
give us your thoughts on how women can

137
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,650
get on non-for-profit board everything

138
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,450
some of just the in depth of

139
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,750
not-for-profit boards thank you is so

140
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,940
terrific to be here and so thrilled to

141
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,960
see the room past week we hoped but this

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,370
is beyond I think our wildest

143
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,040
expectations and I love seeing all those

144
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,640
hands raised for interest in nonprofit

145
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,410
and for-profit boards

146
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,690
let me keep an eye on the time to also

147
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,660
okay so because she'll had a lot to say

148
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm sure you have lots of questions oh

149
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,690
I'm ensign so so first of all they

150
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,360
there's a tremendous opportunity for

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,730
women in particular for men and women

152
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,790
but I think this is particularly special

153
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,770
important for women to develop as

154
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,500
leaders through non-profit board service

155
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,620
and for those who have served on

156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,270
nonprofit boards it can be a

157
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,060
transformational experience it is the

158
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,080
first time that you're among a group of

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,590
peers fully accountable for the mission

160
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,410
and the implementation of the

161
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,740
organization's work and

162
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,690
it gives you a different view of the

163
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,639
world entirely the people that I work

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,220
with in place on ports there's their

165
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,440
change from the experience it for the

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,389
first time they really can relate to

167
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,060
what it means for either company or a

168
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,819
non-profit for any entity to be on the

169
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,990
governing board room and the

170
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,310
responsibility and the accountability

171
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,880
and the exit and the ethics and crisis

172
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,410
management of all of the implications of

173
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,660
of being on a non-profit of being on a

174
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,789
board of directors I also wanna talk

175
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,590
about finding the right board being an

176
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,110
effective nonprofit board member and the

177
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,300
extent to which nonprofit board service

178
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,349
could potentially be useful in the past

179
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,789
if you're interested in for-profit

180
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,419
boards so finding the right nonprofit

181
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:23,199
board is is it's a critical issue and as

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,030
we've mentioned earlier I trained and

183
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,680
play several hundred business executives

184
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,449
and professionals on nonprofit boards I

185
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,550
spend months sometimes a year or two

186
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,120
with each candidate and I start with the

187
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,340
premise we're not done until you fall in

188
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,780
love and you think that they think

189
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,979
you're the greatest thing that ever

190
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,020
happened to them and most of the people

191
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,060
I play wind up in leadership positions

192
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,530
often shares the boards and certainly

193
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,440
officers and chairs of committees and

194
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,870
the key is this everyone says well you

195
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,370
have to be passionate about the issue

196
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,780
absolutely

197
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,009
but most people have many many interests

198
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,630
I've worked with candidates there's

199
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,849
often a zigzag in the process where they

200
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,340
start with one thing and then take in

201
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,630
there whether under if that's actually

202
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,340
really what I want to do and I love that

203
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,870
because it's a journey it was like okay

204
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,520
what are we to look at next you know and

205
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,770
they often wind up somewhere they didn't

206
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,289
think they might be interested in and

207
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,729
sometimes it's more match of that person

208
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,180
to the right culture all kinds of fit

209
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,599
issues but here's the biggest factor

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,880
just about everyone I interview from the

211
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,789
beginning says I want to be useful I

212
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:35,000
want to add value and that is the key

213
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,940
because if you're useful you will have a

214
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,130
phenomenal experience and that is where

215
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,849
you will grow and you

216
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:44,850
shine and develop as a leader and learn

217
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,709
develop skills you will bring back to

218
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,000
work and yes on the path to either

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,529
bigger fancier boards but that's what

220
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,819
you want for profit boards and I will

221
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,769
get to that because it's certainly far

222
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:00,690
from a guarantee but it is like a

223
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,720
parallel career path to your job you

224
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,220
know if you think about volunteer

225
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,380
service and all of its forms and then

226
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,240
nonprofit board service many people

227
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,829
start on the boards of smaller

228
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,519
organizations and then move up depending

229
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,440
on what your interests are so when I

230
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,410
said the key is the opportunity to add

231
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,440
value what that means is looking at

232
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,540
missions and programs this is very nice

233
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,870
and very important but most importantly

234
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,670
you want to understand what the

235
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,620
challenges and the opportunities are

236
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,540
facing each organization that you might

237
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,199
consider so one of the first questions

238
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,819
when I'm assessing a non-profit and

239
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,399
their board needs is is to understand

240
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,740
their revenue model which if you don't

241
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,300
have me working with you you can look on

242
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,750
guys start and find their 990s and it

243
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,600
will give you a pretty good idea and

244
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,089
then the next cut so what are they

245
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,009
trying to accomplish what's the revenue

246
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,800
model to get there and then for

247
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,930
nonprofits and business people are

248
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,240
almost always very surprised at how

249
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,100
complex they are compared to for-profit

250
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,470
but the revenues are mixed of government

251
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,800
philanthropy fees for services a whole

252
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,139
smorgasbord with all kinds of different

253
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,470
timing and expectations it's complicated

254
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,949
and that as I said often surprising to

255
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:24,720
business people who serve a non-profit

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,779
board and every organization like every

257
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,600
company has its challenges so don't be

258
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,939
afraid of that the issue is going in

259
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,139
with your eyes wide open

260
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,149
know what you're getting in for so one

261
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:37,199
is what are they trying to accomplish

262
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,029
what's the revenue model to get there

263
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,060
and then who was already on the board so

264
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,240
you can tell a lot about an organization

265
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,120
saying with the company with anything by

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,170
looking at who is on the

267
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,810
bored if they're very dependent on

268
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,700
corporate philanthropy but the board is

269
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,060
all community activists that's going to

270
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,920
be tough situation doesn't mean you

271
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,899
don't do it but you need to understand

272
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,360
what they need from you and think about

273
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,459
how realistic I would say I do not

274
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,790
introduce people to boards I don't even

275
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,860
consider boards where the CEO isn't

276
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,639
really excellent because then you're not

277
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,670
going to really be able to use your time

278
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,139
productively it can be really

279
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,170
frustrating so I think that's a major

280
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,550
factor so final report it's non-profit

281
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,070
board it is a journey and it is fun and

282
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,440
we agreed we talked about action steps

283
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,880
and I can talk a little bit more later

284
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,690
but first thing is talk to people my

285
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,269
family says I'm obsessed with volunteer

286
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,730
service and nonprofit boards and then I

287
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,500
can go on and on even as family

288
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
situations like oh my god there she goes

289
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,870
but we're not make parties or events to

290
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,730
me the icebreaker question is what kind

291
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,640
of service people are involved in and

292
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,860
first of all people light up when they

293
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,240
talk about the nonprofit's they're

294
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,850
involved in and if it's a board then

295
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,100
it's a really juicy conversation and

296
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,910
again people get excited but you will

297
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,380
learn about so many different

298
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,769
organizations and board experiences from

299
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,829
people just by starting to ask those

300
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:18,449
questions you'll be surprised at how

301
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,430
many people do serve and you'll start to

302
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,459
get the hang of it and you could learn

303
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,410
about an opportunity and learning from

304
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,360
someone who's on a board is very helpful

305
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,339
because as I said it's a matter going in

306
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,579
with your eyes wide open okay looking at

307
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,170
the time okay being an effective

308
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,839
nonprofit board member okay this is

309
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,750
really important obviously you're not

310
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,360
going to do it unless you really want to

311
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,660
do a good job and that's important for

312
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,449
your own satisfaction but also it's a

313
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:51,860
reflection on you and your firm the

314
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,389
extent to which you perform well so

315
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:56,639
there really is no point unless you're

316
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,569
going to and what that means there you

317
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:01,900
can find all kinds of lists

318
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,410
what the role of a board is hiring CEO

319
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,290
strategy and mission etc okay I have

320
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,500
kind of a variation on the theme which

321
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,190
is what I proselytize which is this

322
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,290
oversight is critical many attorneys in

323
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,450
this room oversight is absolutely

324
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,640
essential if you don't fulfill that

325
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,320
responsibility of the board the

326
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,300
organization's in serious jeopardy and

327
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,460
the olden days I said you know the New

328
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,710
York Times test now at social media and

329
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,270
it's a flash you know

330
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,250
it's trouble and hard to recoup from

331
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,370
that but if that's all that a board does

332
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,760
you haven't advanced the ball so you

333
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,620
want in the next three to five years

334
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,300
with your fellow board members to look

335
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,890
back and say hey look what we

336
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,220
accomplished so in order to do that it

337
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,380
means working with the CEO of the board

338
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,590
and this is the consulting work I do to

339
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,050
envision and organizations greater

340
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,880
potential so you know the mission the

341
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,800
compelling value you add but when you

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,290
look out to the future where do you want

343
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,300
this organization to be and the CEO can

344
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,880
be very helpful to you and understanding

345
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,460
the landscape so it could be expanding

346
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,170
but it could be narrowing your focus it

347
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,640
could be expanding geographically or

348
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,280
programmatically it will definitely

349
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,290
involve strategic alliances I hardly

350
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,180
know a nonprofit that isn't involved and

351
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,000
it's a great way to enrich offerings so

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,770
envision what the greater potential is

353
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,250
that's number one number two what's the

354
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,830
revenue model to maximize success and

355
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,840
that's key because a vision is

356
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,550
meaningless without that and as

357
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,360
businesspeople

358
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,500
you know we understand that and as I

359
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,460
said there's there's it's a real mix of

360
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,550
it's like a patchwork quilt of revenue

361
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,020
opportunities and it's a matter of

362
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,400
figuring out how how do we maximize

363
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,730
success then based on that what is the

364
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,130
role of the board not to see on the

365
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,740
staff the board to maximize success

366
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,360
based on the vision and revenue model

367
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,060
then what are we expecting of ourselves

368
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,880
as individuals and you know that gets

369
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,410
into the gift yet certainly into

370
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,780
attendance at meetings and you don't

371
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,490
have to have a universal case yet but

372
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,550
you might have a guideline and you might

373
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,650
what and that gets to composition so you

374
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,920
want the vision the revenue model role

375
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,990
of the board this specific board not

376
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,480
generic but what do we need to do to

377
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,030
make this happen and then expectations

378
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,730
and then most importantly our

379
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,150
composition okay I'm going to be up soon

380
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,100
good time we'll have many much more time

381
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,990
to talk but board composition is

382
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,550
critical so if you're going to build a

383
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,500
team of 10 people you don't say oh let

384
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,210
me go 5 10 people who like what we do

385
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,300
you have an idea of what you're looking

386
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,150
for so once you understand the vision

387
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,640
the revenue model the role of the board

388
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,130
then you can say what is the mix what is

389
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,930
the diversity of skills experience

390
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,510
expertise networks relationships what do

391
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,510
we need what's the smallest group that

392
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,030
can accomplish this job and what does it

393
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,520
look like and then think about who you

394
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,120
have the fits in and who is on the board

395
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,420
who no longer can produce in terms of

396
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,280
where you're going next thank them

397
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,010
celebrate them they need to move off but

398
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,660
it's because you're in a new stage for

399
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,920
the organization and then you

400
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,560
identifying recruit the people you need

401
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,750
to fill out this picture of ideal board

402
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,060
composition the next is the committee

403
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,860
structure board meeting agendas

404
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,090
everything aligned with what you're

405
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,710
trying to accomplish as a board to

406
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,350
maximize the organization success so

407
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,930
that's really the way I would lay it out

408
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,510
the final point I can elaborate on any

409
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,370
of this is the extension which nonprofit

410
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,750
board service might potentially be

411
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,550
useful paving the way for a private or

412
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,980
public company fort I wrote an article I

413
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,480
saw that I had copies to bring but I

414
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,250
didn't have reprinted but it's online

415
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,830
it's called amassing your governance

416
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,820
capital and I interviewed lots of CEOs

417
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,680
and board chairman of public companies

418
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,109
and and search firms etc etc and what

419
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,060
was clear it has a lot of really good

420
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,329
stories and lessons what's clear is

421
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,800
being on a non-profit board is your

422
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,359
shield will tell you does not promise

423
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,250
you a place ultimately on a for-profit

424
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,210
board but there is no one so it's not a

425
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,520
project public company board that

426
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,560
have not served on nonprofit boards not

427
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
a one and this is what every chairman

428
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,540
told me this is what every CEO told me

429
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,210
this is what every term and it's obvious

430
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,730
and it really is a learning experience

431
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,570
is critical

432
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,120
and as you move up in the ranks one of

433
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,580
the women in the story started in her

434
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,010
20s at a local why wound up on the board

435
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,140
of Stanford through those relaxed

436
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,030
relationships she met someone who put

437
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,680
her on her first private company board

438
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,090
and now she's on tons of boards and

439
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,510
reads them etc so on the write boards

440
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,220
although I work with a small

441
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,520
organization and it's an all CEO board

442
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,990
the budgets three million but everyone

443
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,240
gives us a minimum of six figures and

444
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,180
it's an all CEO board if you are on a

445
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,620
board with the right people and do a

446
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,200
really good job this is this is a

447
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,950
valuable opportunity so I will stop at

448
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,150
this I will say that everyone in this

449
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,360
room brings incredible value on privacy

450
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,630
on security legal strategy risk

451
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,940
management think about your superpowers

452
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,020
what you bring to the table and you

453
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,120
should do this you should absolutely do

454
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,490
it there's just a it's a

455
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,230
transformational experience for everyone

456
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,500
I know who who's done it so I will cut a

457
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,830
fair Sheila has a lot to tell us thanks

458
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,840
Allison I can I can echo that when I

459
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,000
spoke with Alice on the phone the second

460
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,760
question she asked me was what board I

461
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,120
was on and what my passion was so thanks

462
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,710
oh thank you for that and you know one

463
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,600
thing I would add to that is what I was

464
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,220
looking for a non-for-profit board to

465
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,590
join I realize that you know it's not

466
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,150
your personal interest it's going to be

467
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,440
the interest of the community or

468
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,210
interest of the board that you have to

469
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,370
focus on so find a board that you're

470
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,840
very passionate about because there are

471
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,900
lots of challenges and you know lots of

472
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,700
health that not-for-profits need so you

473
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,290
have to be very passionate about what

474
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,050
the causes so now let's kind of move to

475
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,270
Sheila you know I come from the

476
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,950
accounting world and when sarbanes-oxley

477
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,710
came they decided you know there has to

478
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,480
be a financial expert on the board and I

479
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,800
know most of the people in here are

480
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,260
either privacy or like myself security

481
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,630
and what I think about joining a

482
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,100
for-profit board I always ask myself

483
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,210
what value

484
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,549
I add and I recently wrote an article

485
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,559
about you know I think privacy and

486
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,480
security should be on the boards because

487
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,980
that's a new emerging topic as well so

488
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,090
so I know that's something that we all

489
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,500
probably in this room have in common

490
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,200
about what value can we add but if you

491
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,820
can go into a little bit more depth on

492
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,020
corporate boards and maybe the

493
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,000
responsibilities that we would have I

494
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,070
will can you read me again how much time

495
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,029
I have you have 10 to 15 minutes okay a

496
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,250
lot of information to go through very

497
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,950
quickly G then we Allison I could do

498
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,529
this on separate sessions for sure and

499
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,980
we're Pekka nated all into one so

500
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,270
forgive me if I talk really fast but I

501
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,559
absolutely want to make sure that we

502
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,799
have time left for your guys's questions

503
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,549
so absolutely go for the nonprofit

504
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:26,860
boards journey I'd never want women to

505
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,899
stop doing their charitable work I just

506
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:32,549
would like you to be paid for it so um

507
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,750
other boards that you might want to

508
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,370
think about you know the media loves to

509
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,320
focus on the fortune 500 board and

510
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,850
that's where you're going to see all the

511
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,970
stat and it just it's not the big

512
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,590
picture they're not the only game in

513
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,029
town right so make sure that you

514
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,429
remember that there's also these smaller

515
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,770
public boards also privately held

516
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,789
company boards and advisory board

517
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,169
advisory boards can mean many different

518
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,090
things it could be first startups it

519
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,029
could be an advisory board for a very

520
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,669
large company and you know Walmart has

521
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:07,299
an advisory board and we're not a search

522
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,580
firm but we do get in a lot of board

523
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,049
opening isn't one of the board of things

524
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:14,320
we got in was for the diversity advisory

525
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,809
board for Toyota and they paid a hundred

526
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,309
grand and they give you far not a bad

527
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:24,039
stick right so don't forget about the

528
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,510
advisory boards they're always a really

529
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,899
great place to start so alright so let's

530
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:30,940
talk about you know the job and

531
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,559
responsibilities and I'm just seriously

532
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,020
I'm so sorry I have these in front of me

533
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,380
but I have shiny object syndrome so if I

534
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,970
see something I'll forget like when I

535
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,080
was talking about or I'll get

536
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,820
sidetracked I just at least have to have

537
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,340
these plus I've got 10 minutes ago all

538
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,950
right so responsibilities of a director

539
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,160
first and foremost is to hire

540
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,100
evaluate and if necessary fire the CEO

541
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,350
it's to bring on other board directors

542
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,140
it is certainly to make sure that

543
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,020
they're in compliance with you know all

544
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,820
of the different regulations that they

545
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,890
have going on of course overseeing the

546
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,310
financial performance overseeing

547
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,000
strategy so it is you know I'm in hands

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,180
oh right because you are not management

549
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,540
you're not the CEO then being an

550
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,580
effective board member just as much as

551
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,020
you talked about with the nonprofit's

552
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,940
pretty much the same I'm not going to go

553
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,920
into that a lot you want to make sure

554
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,850
you're getting along with your fellow

555
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,400
board members and you definitely need to

556
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,350
be prepared these are in addition to

557
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,450
what she's said you know sometimes it's

558
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,130
a lot to read through those board

559
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,050
packets before the meeting base I'm

560
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,400
pretty sure we've all been in meetings

561
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,960
where people haven't been prepared and a

562
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,750
little bit of million and then of course

563
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,760
effects company goes into crisis mode

564
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,680
you're probably going to have to be

565
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,390
there in triple time so just keep that

566
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,070
in mind if you have a job right so the

567
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,870
risks of serving of course you want to

568
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,030
make sure that the board always has D&O

569
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,350
insurance directors and officers

570
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,040
insurance your reputation will never be

571
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,320
covered by insurance so make sure that

572
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,700
no matter what kind of board you're

573
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,030
getting on that you are really doing due

574
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,300
diligence you know and and alice' talked

575
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,560
about knowing who the other board

576
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,310
members are and the CEO absolutely know

577
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,700
who the audit company is you know check

578
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,820
out the company thoroughly just because

579
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,020
somebody asked to be on the board does

580
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,730
not mean you should go on that board you

581
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,180
need to do your due diligence and you

582
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,770
know keep in mind too that if the price

583
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,370
does think you might be sued so you know

584
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,100
it's going to be covered under dnl

585
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,840
insurance as long as you are performing

586
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:48,570
your due diligence the time commitment

587
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,900
of serving is you know the average for

588
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,850
what NACD puts up the National

589
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,470
Association of corporate directors is

590
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,900
that for corporate board on average is

591
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,360
children 50 to 300 hours per year and

592
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,730
you know I've had directors tell me that

593
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,320
that's really high and then for private

594
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,420
boards it can be more but most likely

595
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,670
it's going to be less these are the

596
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,530
things that you're finding out in the

597
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,620
interview process for sure but again

598
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,299
it's just all part of you're doing your

599
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,080
due diligence so compensation because I

600
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,520
know that's always of interest everybody

601
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,820
right so for for times sake we're just

602
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,059
going to say that the public boards you

603
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,070
can find that information online in

604
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,380
their proxy all right all of that is

605
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,160
right there for you private boards

606
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,700
really will range and because they're

607
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,530
private we don't really know what

608
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,669
they're paying their directors all the

609
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,150
time but it could be anywhere from you

610
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,090
know they're giving their board members

611
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,280
at a smaller board it might be $5,000

612
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,760
you know retainer with some equity or

613
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,490
you go up the big private companies

614
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,350
we'll definitely near the the public

615
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,660
companies which you know could be a lot

616
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,500
of money like half million you know two

617
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,090
hundred fifty thousand and that would

618
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,380
include both cash and stock just

619
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,580
remember you have to pay taxes on that

620
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,020
so it's it's best should definitely not

621
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,370
be the only reason why you want to be on

622
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,480
board is for the compensation and let's

623
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,750
see so why pursue board service besides

624
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,450
the compensation of course is definitely

625
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,640
an intellectual challenge you're at the

626
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,679
table with extremely smart people and

627
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,030
you know if you are still in your career

628
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,000
they definitely can be a big boost for

629
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,980
your career as well and you're learning

630
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,200
all the time of course it's a great

631
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,580
resume and reputation builder as well

632
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,660
you know it's just everybody's

633
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,220
motivation is always going to be

634
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,500
different but what we hear all the time

635
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,080
is that no matter what they're getting

636
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,790
they are they're giving they're

637
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,600
definitely getting more out of it so

638
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,669
definitely worth the time so the

639
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:11,740
different skills that we're seeing that

640
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,550
our need is definitely that risk

641
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,340
you know so we've gotten in probably a

642
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,200
hundred and thirty different board

643
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,460
openings down the last couple of years

644
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,040
which is amazing so I took I have a

645
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,350
really good pulse on what boards are

646
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,410
looking for and thank goodness it isn't

647
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,150
just the financial expert anymore and

648
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,190
that really started to shift pretty

649
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,320
dramatically five seven years ago I

650
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,030
can't believe I've been doing this for

651
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,590
50 years so it's really crazy I think

652
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,880
they started one of 25 yeah um no I

653
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,770
didn't and so um what would they see

654
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,610
shiny object right right there what was

655
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,300
I talking about

656
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,390
oh right skillset pink that was the test

657
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,790
make sure you guys are listening so

658
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,730
technology is definite so yes it's

659
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,040
changed a lot in the last five to seven

660
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,410
years especially in the last three years

661
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,750
which is really great news for all of us

662
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,120
that are not a financial expert right so

663
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,410
there's certainly our boards that are

664
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,300
looking for them they need they need

665
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,910
them on their board for sure but they

666
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,250
don't need a table full of them anymore

667
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,810
so technology risk management HR talent

668
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,690
management operations I mean we've seen

669
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,450
it all sales and marketing M&A

670
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,570
experience we've had you know companies

671
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,060
come to us that are looking for you know

672
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,120
someone with retail experience that's a

673
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
digital disruptor um you know

674
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,670
engineering the technology specialist so

675
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,220
it's really all across the board

676
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,760
so don't let that hold you back all

677
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,310
right what am I forgetting like you know

678
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,320
a question that I think a lot of us

679
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,180
probably may have is how do we find out

680
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,910
about for openings I know going to

681
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,610
somebody like you but one or some other

682
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,190
way there you know what you can get hear

683
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,960
about board openings through so many

684
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,590
different services these days and you

685
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,750
know sign up to be a part of a database

686
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,420
or whatever but it's just there's no

687
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,940
easy way to the boardroom it's all about

688
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,310
networking and you really you need to

689
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,800
make sure that you have your board

690
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,810
portfolio put together that professional

691
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,340
profile

692
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,770
that board bio that really highlights

693
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,080
your skills and background for board

694
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,290
positioning and what I really begun is

695
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,120
working with our numbers on the

696
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,240
networking piece of it so you know it's

697
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,890
really reaching up to your network and

698
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,710
those influencers and connectors and you

699
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,320
know a lot of times we're so focused on

700
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,630
our current network that we forget that

701
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,570
we have people that we you know I mean

702
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,010
how many times you run into Joe that

703
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,720
you've known for twenty years and you

704
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,180
haven't talked about five right so it's

705
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,500
really important to make sure that

706
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,740
you're rien gauging with people and you

707
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,030
know we as we're we're such great

708
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,700
networkers really we are but we are not

709
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,670
good at using our network we're not good

710
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,780
for asking for help

711
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,070
it's like I'm accession what can I do

712
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,370
for you what can I do for you and um you

713
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,780
know what I've really learned too is

714
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,450
that really digging in and figuring out

715
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,280
like if someone says oh the networking

716
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,250
processes that work for me on like let's

717
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,290
see what you're doing wrong because I

718
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,870
know what does right I mean we have so

719
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,540
many of our members getting on boards to

720
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,450
this networking process and what I find

721
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,480
really so we'll do like a role playoffs

722
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,160
I hope you what is it that you're saying

723
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,930
to this person and I found out that

724
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,360
they're saying to them oh my gosh Sally

725
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,850
you know I'm really interesting getting

726
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,440
onto a board and I know you've been

727
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,750
there and you've done that so how did

728
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,420
you do it what advice do you have for me

729
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,640
and I'm like that's what I'm here for

730
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,070
you come to me for that information you

731
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,700
go to your network ready right so

732
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,980
there's a big difference from that

733
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,710
conversation to them going to them with

734
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,380
that elevator pitch of hey Sally I want

735
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,610
to let you know I'm really interested in

736
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,620
getting into a corporate board and I'm

737
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,920
looking for small or mid-cap you know

738
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,480
private our public companies

739
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,980
specifically I'm looking for something

740
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,720
in retail hospitality health care and my

741
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,180
skill set for verbal board service is

742
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,030
boom boom boom and then you end it with

743
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,590
would love to know if there's anyone in

744
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,900
your network that you can catch me - big

745
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,710
difference between those two so it is

746
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,690
but it's the process because we have to

747
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:38,899
get

748
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,690
over that fear of you know not wanting

749
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,299
to ask for help and you know there's

750
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,429
also the right way to reach out to

751
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,729
people and when to reach out to them and

752
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:51,619
then you can't assume either that you've

753
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,999
told them once and they're supposed to

754
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:56,269
remember so you have to maintain great

755
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:57,799
thank you for that

756
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:01,129
so we constantly read there's number of

757
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:02,779
reasons why I need gender diversity on

758
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:03,769
boards you know can be better

759
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,659
decision-making understanding your

760
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,879
consumer base better I think the one

761
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:10,009
that I read that was most powerful to me

762
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,809
was that it increases financial

763
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,419
performance when you have a gender

764
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:16,879
diverse board so there are the the

765
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,589
Pearson Institute's that you know if you

766
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:21,379
have 30% female leadership it could add

767
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,779
up to 6% points on your net margin and

768
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:26,059
McKinsey and company actually said the

769
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,889
companies are 15 percent more likely to

770
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:29,509
outperform their peers when they have

771
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:31,849
gender diversity so I'm going to ask you

772
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,659
two questions

773
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:36,139
Allison and Sheila is what will one

774
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:37,789
what's the biggest challenge or

775
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,070
significant barrier to have a female

776
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,009
leadership and then two what do you feel

777
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,349
that the number one reason should be or

778
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:46,849
one of your top reasons to have that

779
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:50,330
gender diversity on board so and I

780
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,039
actually put an article at your tables

781
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,539
called better better boys better

782
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,200
government

783
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,570
I think that's or a variation on that

784
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,950
because I wrote a chapter to book on

785
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,320
that to like talking about the

786
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,909
for-profit companies to begin with

787
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,339
because it's it's a very clear cut in

788
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,299
terms of company maximizing its

789
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,309
potential financially and in terms of

790
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:13,489
shareholder value the average in the S&P

791
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:15,679
500 the average number of you looking to

792
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,239
put noses average number of board

793
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:21,229
members is 10 point 7 the average age is

794
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:24,739
63 it's going up not down that means the

795
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:29,029
internet came came on when they were 40

796
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:31,940
so in terms of Technology savviness and

797
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,419
that the odds route there are fewer than

798
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:42,019
it's 18 percent are women 15 percent are

799
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,190
minority and fewer than one per board

800
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,320
something like six or six point seven

801
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,309
percent of my value city sits in the are

802
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,460
our people have been for who were born

803
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,460
in a country other than the US so think

804
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,909
about that and the fact that three

805
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:01,559
billion people are entering the middle

806
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,049
class in emerging markets a massive

807
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,719
market opportunity that an Africa alone

808
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,840
consumer facing industries are will see

809
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,119
an increase is four hundred billion

810
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,840
dollars that women make 75% of

811
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,429
discretionary spending decisions

812
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,879
worldwide so these are massive market

813
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:23,159
opportunities in my mind the role of a

814
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,109
for-profit board parallel to a

815
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:27,539
non-profit board is to imagine this

816
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,129
company's greater potential in the

817
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:31,979
global marketplace well to do that if

818
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:33,899
you've got a very homogeneous group of

819
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,820
people I don't care who they are they're

820
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,070
homogeneous but basically you have old

821
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,129
white men I mean that's that's the

822
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:44,009
demographic then and with similar

823
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:46,139
backgrounds you know having grown up in

824
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:47,969
the United States similar backgrounds

825
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:52,379
how can a group like that how can they

826
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:55,469
possibly imagine a company's greater

827
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:59,580
potential and also given the the the

828
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,009
lack of the internet and technology and

829
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:06,029
which is at the center of all of the big

830
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:07,919
opportunities not to mention security

831
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,260
privacy etcetera so imagine instead

832
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,989
aboard with people from a variety of

833
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,960
different backgrounds ages genders

834
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,149
having grown up in different countries

835
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,190
they can still be running major

836
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,839
companies c-suite people PhD from MIT oh

837
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,480
you know all the qualifications that you

838
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,449
want but that kind of board I would bet

839
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,839
my money on in terms of imagining what's

840
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,210
possible and even knowing what questions

841
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,440
to ask so I think it's I mean and an

842
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,480
oddly said I mean all the data point to

843
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,299
less fraud less conflict of interest

844
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:49,409
higher ROI we all all of the benefits

845
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,319
are heavily documented now McKinsey

846
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:55,440
Credit Suisse you mentioned some there

847
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,779
are many studies now non-profit board

848
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:00,150
just imagined similarly so I've been

849
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,140
working with nonprofit boards for 25

850
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,350
you're talked about yes you are also on

851
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:12,760
15 and and boards had been extremely

852
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,090
homogeneous now sometimes it's better

853
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,310
sometimes it's not but how can a

854
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,710
non-profit imagine that organizations

855
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,000
greater potential and understand and

856
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,380
maximize the revenue potential if

857
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,670
they're all from the same group in the

858
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,860
same background and I facilitate

859
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,050
retreats of nonprofit boards and there

860
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,940
were two weekends back to back and one I

861
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,400
was some it was doing the retreat and

862
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,410
all of that a very homogeneous board and

863
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,450
it was an organization that was really

864
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,750
struggling financially and I threw out a

865
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,150
variety of ideas of ways they can reap

866
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,730
they could reach different segments of

867
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,980
the population and each time they're

868
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,720
like oh no no they wouldn't be justified

869
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,580
is that what we're about all they can

870
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,410
imagine were people exactly like

871
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,260
themselves being served and in fact I

872
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,490
didn't even understand how they would

873
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,190
qualify for 501c3 because it was such an

874
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,760
exclusive group and they saw themselves

875
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,400
serving their group exclusively the

876
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,960
following weekend I was facilitating

877
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,990
retreat an education Opportunity

878
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:22,060
Organization for boys of Latino and and

879
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,380
and Latino and black boys and it was

880
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,740
such a diverse group I'm not talking in

881
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,500
the obvious how people look but there

882
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,290
were highly successful businesspeople

883
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,150
and there was a teacher from one of the

884
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,180
schools there was a white person who

885
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,810
grew up from a guy ran a company very

886
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,000
limited background in education with his

887
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,700
big opportunity every person in the room

888
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,920
had a very unique and different and

889
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,010
unexpected background and as I threw out

890
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,740
each issue it was like a symphony of

891
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,500
what we staviska genomic and then you

892
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,930
know we brought it to a conclusion but

893
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,360
it was like whoa this is so rich the

894
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,340
thinking the ideas that well what about

895
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,950
that and it was just the opposite so

896
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,870
it's just if you know you've all been in

897
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,610
groups where it's everyone's similar

898
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,890
or there's more variety and backgrounds

899
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,290
and you know that the richness of the

900
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,470
vision the ideas understanding risk I

901
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,420
means the mitigating risk is a big issue

902
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,380
so I think it's just it's very clear how

903
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,710
and that the what's the problem mmm this

904
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,460
is being taped well I'm dying over here

905
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,460
just okay you go next by Maya okay I

906
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,800
mean there's a kid on and talked to god

907
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,370
truth

908
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,920
I just can't people who are the people

909
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,620
who are in power why would they want to

910
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,900
relinquish it right okay totally

911
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,240
financially beneficial I mean that's

912
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,930
what it comes down to in my mind right

913
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,640
okay I'm yeah I'm gonna totally

914
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,590
sidetrack this because on that note

915
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,290
right and I'm going up and then going to

916
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,440
anyway so today I'm fine here and in

917
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,970
first class because it was really just

918
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,130
kind of ticket by the way and now that I

919
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,030
have to make any excuses for that but if

920
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,300
ten people nine white dudes in me right

921
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,930
I mean that this is why they're not

922
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,670
giving up those board seats and so I

923
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,190
don't ever talk about the low is us I

924
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,990
might get off your putt I use different

925
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,600
word but we're being tit and do the work

926
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,490
right because you are qualified you are

927
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,080
good enough and they're looking for you

928
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,270
so have that confidence and stop waiting

929
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,150
to check every single box before you go

930
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,150
for it because not only is these white

931
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,160
dudes sitting there I mean like white

932
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,250
privilege is an issue no matter how you

933
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,580
look at it so many ways till tomorrow

934
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,650
and like just get up and do the work

935
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,030
because they're not going to give those

936
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,540
seats up you have to go get them and

937
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,700
it's not to say that old white guys are

938
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,980
just bored

939
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,420
so out of the eleven or something like

940
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,070
that they don't acknowledge that moment

941
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,020
generates I mean but they can bring

942
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,270
something yes I may be absolutely okay

943
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,460
so a couple

944
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,350
to ask investment oh yeah there's no

945
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,540
about artisanal get them but there's

946
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,680
quite a lot of people here that don't

947
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,490
know where to start

948
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,860
right exactly how about think about

949
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,780
where we start or if we want to be

950
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,400
better prepared reports orders what can

951
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,260
we do thank you are actual things that

952
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,540
you all can begin do now right okay so

953
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,830
know why you want sir

954
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,100
right and I have some postcards here by

955
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,560
the way that have these ten tips on here

956
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,560
know why you want to serve create a plan

957
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,140
and you have those board documents that

958
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,790
I talked about that board BA do that

959
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,440
professional profile that highlight your

960
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,260
background forward positioning so that

961
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,360
you really do know your skill set and

962
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,640
that you can articulate that to your

963
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,570
network your personal brand is key of

964
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,760
course make sure you're always doing a

965
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,030
bang-up job wherever you're at because

966
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,130
you're being watched all the time if

967
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,630
you're on those nonprofit boards you

968
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,930
take a leadership role and you show up

969
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,190
because we know too many times that

970
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,290
doesn't happen so always bring your

971
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,690
a-game educate yourself that doesn't I'm

972
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,450
not saying that you know because women

973
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,650
love to do this they're like oh my god

974
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,270
x2 can she come I should go get another

975
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,390
degree I think I should go and become

976
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,930
board certified and I'm not ready and

977
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,270
I'm like yes you are you're good like

978
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,040
how many of those port openings do you

979
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,930
think that have come to us that have

980
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:30,170
said we're looking for a board director

981
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:35,450
who's certified zero right so none of

982
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,400
them are looking for that so don't go

983
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,900
and get you don't have to go get

984
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,150
certified it's not today maybe in two

985
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,610
years I don't know but there's plenty of

986
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,160
stuff that you can google read about

987
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,610
webinars all of that information on what

988
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,420
it means to be a board director and if

989
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,460
you have no more experience because you

990
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,580
know besides those nonprofit boards if

991
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,220
you have no experience consider hospital

992
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,890
boards government boards university

993
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,670
boards and if you know entrepreneurism

994
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,430
they need to start an advisory board Tom

995
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,900
started by stir bar to put you on

996
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,340
there's a really great book by a woman

997
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,040
here in DC who verse eleven is called

998
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,140
built to scale and she gives you

999
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,569
step-by-step

1000
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:22,069
you know how to create an advisory board

1001
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:23,450
for your company and you read it you're

1002
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,180
the expert that's right you know what be

1003
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,430
in it for the long haul there's just

1004
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,170
there's no quick and easy way to the

1005
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,940
boardroom so like those all those

1006
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,440
databases out there with the board

1007
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,550
openings you know I just I tell people

1008
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,900
all the time actually join them in the

1009
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,220
board room because we get in all those

1010
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,750
board opening is because it's really

1011
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,630
icing on the cake art you know my whole

1012
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,150
goal is to help them do the sport that

1013
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,900
it takes to put themselves forward and

1014
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,970
of course then the networking which I

1015
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,430
talked to that's more about I think it's

1016
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,450
really interesting that you talked about

1017
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,950
government board someone recently told

1018
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,109
me too I live in Orlando and I looked at

1019
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:02,329
the city of Orlando and they had 67

1020
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:04,970
board openings and there was one 4ip on

1021
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,099
it which is exactly what I do and then

1022
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:09,079
when I submitted it they said I was the

1023
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:11,510
first person to apply in 12 months Wow

1024
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,720
oh yeah probably an easy way to get into

1025
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,650
that oh cool I may be the IC on its

1026
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,890
board member yeah so before I open it up

1027
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,270
I'm gonna ask you a personal question

1028
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,119
so I got my MBA at Wharton Business

1029
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,220
School and I'm not going to say who this

1030
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,720
was because everybody knows who this

1031
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,109
person is but I was we were we were

1032
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:36,290
taken out to a roundtable discussion and

1033
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,660
I asked this person what's the number

1034
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,130
one advice that you could give a woman I

1035
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,760
was probably late 20s early 30s about

1036
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,190
serving on a corporate board and he said

1037
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:52,010
just don't ever get pregnant so the good

1038
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,359
thing about Wharton Business School is

1039
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,309
50 percent or female and 50 percent are

1040
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:58,099
male so I guess kind of what are you

1041
00:42:58,099 --> 00:42:59,750
seeing with some of the people that you

1042
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,549
work with of like the influence of

1043
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:03,950
motherhood or Maternity I have young

1044
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,920
children myself but that's I mean I'm

1045
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,210
still in shock

1046
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:14,069
what else okay I know but um so what

1047
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:16,290
kind of advice I didn't have children at

1048
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,970
that time but it was a shock to me as

1049
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,480
you know being there a very influential

1050
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,640
person I think you're asking me what

1051
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,160
kind of advice I would give mothers or

1052
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,349
but the subject doesn't come up okay

1053
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,599
okay the hele yeah that's why I'm like

1054
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,640
what yeah I would be why would that

1055
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,329
discussion happen no I be persistent

1056
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:40,650
being it for the long haul

1057
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,359
and do the work and you know what

1058
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:43,619
sometimes just got to take it step by

1059
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:49,319
step and yeah I mean we're dealing

1060
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,240
there's so many unconscious bias

1061
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,829
ensuring that that's it's the problem I

1062
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:57,450
one of the things I love about nonprofit

1063
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,569
boards is that most of the time almost

1064
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:01,890
all the time

1065
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,010
women can move into leadership positions

1066
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,900
most of the time for a non-profit board

1067
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,540
if you're willing to say if you know

1068
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,369
well who's going to do this who's going

1069
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:13,680
to do that I will and if you love it

1070
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,109
I find the busiest people if you love

1071
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:17,549
what they're doing and feel you can be

1072
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:19,770
useful so you will wind up saying I'll

1073
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,450
help with that and before you know it

1074
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,980
you're helping with things and you wind

1075
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,420
up in the leadership role and you why do

1076
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,190
people move wind up as chair of the

1077
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,430
board and that's an extraordinary

1078
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,890
opportunity to develop yourself to show

1079
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,980
what you can do to have that sense of

1080
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,170
competence and translate that into your

1081
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,690
work and potentially for-profit boards

1082
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,270
so it's one of the it's the magic of

1083
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,890
nonprofit boards it's wonderful there

1084
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,380
soon as the barriers are far fewer great

1085
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,559
so we have about I think a good 20

1086
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,160
minutes do we have questions

1087
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,680
great do we have someone who

1088
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,339
don't take this week

1089
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,790
I believe it was mentioned earlier that

1090
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,280
you had said it's more important or its

1091
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,560
best or needed to be on a non-profit

1092
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,110
board before a corporation board or a

1093
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,570
for-profit board is that is that did I

1094
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,460
hear that right and if so why is that

1095
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,710
important so when I actually the the

1096
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,970
publisher for directors rewards asked me

1097
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,770
to write an article about this and it's

1098
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,240
one called amassing your governance

1099
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,230
capital he said you know if you're on a

1100
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,300
non-profit board then can you go on to a

1101
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,330
for-profit board and or how important is

1102
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:47,540
that

1103
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,830
and I interviewed many executive search

1104
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,170
firm people who do for-profit board

1105
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,110
placement chairs and CEOs of public

1106
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,530
company boards and that they basically

1107
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,930
said if you're on a non-profit board I

1108
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,990
mean this would there's no promise or

1109
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,970
reason to think you would wind up on a

1110
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,980
for-profit board I mean it depends on

1111
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,840
the trajectory that as I said the

1112
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,720
opening anecdote I tells of a woman who

1113
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,630
did start with a loja why and moved her

1114
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,180
way up the ladder and was on the

1115
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,220
Stanford University board and that is as

1116
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,260
Sheila said universities hospitals where

1117
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,410
you meet people usually who could if

1118
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,110
they're pressed they can provide access

1119
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,380
to invitations to for-profit boards but

1120
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,990
what was a hundred percent clear with

1121
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,120
everybody and then since then I've sort

1122
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,340
of followed it and looked at bios of

1123
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,500
people in for-profit boys there is not a

1124
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,660
single for-profit board member they said

1125
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,480
who has not had a non-profit board

1126
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,040
experience and it really is it really is

1127
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,380
a Learning and Development experience

1128
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,390
and opportunity and they did say that's

1129
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,940
not what's going to get you a seat on a

1130
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,460
for-profit board but it will come up

1131
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,290
recommendations and as Sheila said

1132
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,420
whatever you do knew well of course but

1133
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,740
we do those are women

1134
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:18,650
and mobilize there but they the word of

1135
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,330
mouth and what people think and

1136
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,950
certainly about your performance on a

1137
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,900
non-profit board that that does come up

1138
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,450
but I one of the the CEO and chairs said

1139
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,109
to me it's also important to them to

1140
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:34,580
companies that all of their board

1141
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,960
members are involved in their

1142
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,440
communities one way or another it it

1143
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,869
brings a richer understanding of needs

1144
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:43,640
and challenges and issues in the world

1145
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,050
and shows support neutral if you wanted

1146
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,180
you have an idea say something oh yeah

1147
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,520
okay so you don't have to get on to a

1148
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,290
non-profit board to get on to a

1149
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,720
corporate board right I hear you when

1150
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,119
you say that all do and I don't know

1151
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,609
that I necessarily agree with that and

1152
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:03,710
I'm not saying I disagree either I just

1153
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,440
have not done that research but what I

1154
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,470
am s all the time is is serving on a

1155
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,050
non-profit board going to help me get

1156
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,390
into the board corporate boardroom and I

1157
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,790
say well maybe and the reason why is

1158
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,820
because if it is a it can if it is a

1159
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,160
well-run board so that you're learning

1160
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,930
good corporate governance and make sure

1161
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,020
it's a large nonprofit board make sure

1162
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,570
there's men at the table because you

1163
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,450
it's a networking opportunity make sure

1164
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,589
of course that you're passionate about

1165
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:35,750
it first I want it I should have said

1166
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,130
you know I never want women step during

1167
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,330
their charitable work and sometimes when

1168
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,980
I go through this list you know I get

1169
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,010
that email right and I'm not saying I

1170
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,240
want women to set during their trail

1171
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,890
work that's not it but again take that

1172
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,630
leadership role know those expectations

1173
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,490
that you talked about that given the get

1174
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,619
also your time commitment do they want

1175
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:53,330
you there for five hours a month or five

1176
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,339
hours a week one year or five years both

1177
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:01,160
are my goals and I want to add something

1178
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,180
that ties with all of this the second

1179
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,890
book I wrote and you've got a brochure

1180
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,660
that you have actually the book a better

1181
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,300
world Inc how companies profit by

1182
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,070
solving global problems where

1183
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,810
governments cannot soon as I wrote it

1184
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,820
before this administration even then but

1185
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,869
okay sorry where DC it's hard not to

1186
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,099
and so I there it's filled with dozens

1187
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:25,850
of case

1188
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,510
of companies and who are leading the way

1189
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,850
in terms of ESG environment social and

1190
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:37,280
governance sustainability etc and it it

1191
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,620
makes it very clear the companies do

1192
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,810
have an opportunity to profit and grow

1193
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,810
value by solving today's most compelling

1194
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,640
challenges environmental social and

1195
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,620
economic and for every threat poverty is

1196
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,600
a threat to companies and their

1197
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,450
prosperity and success climate

1198
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,070
ecosystems education health care there's

1199
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,350
a chapter in each these are all threats

1200
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,660
not only to humanity but to prosperity

1201
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,320
and company success but every one of

1202
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,480
them is an opportunity like in your

1203
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,050
field which is really hot is

1204
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,940
cybersecurity privacy the greatest

1205
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,940
threat but it means for companies that

1206
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,940
find solutions innovative solutions the

1207
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,920
greatest opportunity to make money and

1208
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,680
that provides an opportunity for you the

1209
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,050
companies that were successful in

1210
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,970
maximizing their potential financially

1211
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,070
by finding innovative solutions to three

1212
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,620
things well the board understood this so

1213
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,950
it's at the board level they partner

1214
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,780
with nonprofits that bring credibility

1215
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,510
and expertise and relationships in

1216
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,640
remote communities or companies don't

1217
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,760
understand but want to and they are

1218
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,200
effective at stakeholder engagement so

1219
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,120
you bring valuable skills to the table

1220
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,640
and I think understanding that it really

1221
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,650
is about the global marketplace in

1222
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,350
today's and tomorrow's world

1223
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,720
and innovation this is this is really

1224
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,970
what board governance is about certainly

1225
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:13,100
in for profits but also nonprofits other

1226
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,570
questions thank you I'm Lauren shy I'm a

1227
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,220
member of our women leading privacy

1228
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,770
advisory board so first thank you for

1229
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,500
your time and your insights in an omni's

1230
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,830
case your horrifying story I have to

1231
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,270
think a personal experience that might

1232
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,810
benefit the the room and it also touches

1233
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,620
on Patrice's question about action items

1234
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,210
Alice you mentioned broader volunteerism

1235
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,980
the nonprofit board membership as

1236
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,460
perhaps a component or extension of that

1237
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,040
how many people in the room volunteer

1238
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,230
that are currently or in the past and no

1239
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,579
judgments if you don't raise your hand

1240
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,470
but how many of you do actually

1241
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,849
volunteer and donate your time perhaps

1242
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:56,010
in your local communities School PTA

1243
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,930
anything okay a lot of people I also

1244
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,400
volunteer in my local community for a

1245
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,150
non-profit and I approached them about

1246
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,589
their board and whether there was an

1247
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:10,559
opportunity to be a board member there

1248
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,920
after about a year of volunteering one

1249
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,030
they were thrilled to know that it was

1250
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,680
interested right they don't know unless

1251
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,119
you approach them and tell them that you

1252
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,609
have an interest and two while a board

1253
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:23,220
position did not materialize it allowed

1254
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,109
me to practice some of the things that

1255
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,180
Sheila had mentioned which is why I'm

1256
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,740
interested in being on a board why I

1257
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,329
think I would be a good board member

1258
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:33,240
with an organization that I know so I

1259
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,559
would really encourage people to think

1260
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,690
about when you go home in the coming

1261
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,400
weeks and months approach those

1262
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,319
organizations and ask them and go

1263
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,460
through your pitch and get the

1264
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,109
experience it will benefit you

1265
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:45,119
regardless of whether a position

1266
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,750
materializes most nonprofits are always

1267
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,970
on the lookout for good candidates

1268
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,040
approach them ask them so that's why I

1269
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,569
say ask people when you meet them what

1270
00:52:54,569 --> 00:52:56,490
they're doing and you will hear about

1271
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,380
things there are also online matching

1272
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,109
services I think for LinkedIn through

1273
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,920
what's wrong with me there but

1274
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,960
california-based

1275
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,819
counselors know I refer to nonprofit

1276
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,859
Matt I'm not non-profit board list I'm

1277
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:15,270
sorry I don't think board source does

1278
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,700
that but hmm it's a board match it's a

1279
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,579
nonprofit matching service I'll think

1280
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,230
I'm sorry I can't believe I'm not

1281
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,780
volunteering as a volunteer match okay

1282
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,630
so anyhow um and so you can learn about

1283
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,549
nonprofits that are looking I would

1284
00:53:29,549 --> 00:53:34,170
caution you extremely the percentage of

1285
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,359
successful matches you know to me if

1286
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,400
it's 70 percent that's a disaster

1287
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,079
because it means 30 out of 100 people

1288
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,510
wanted to do something and wound up in

1289
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,549
up their first board meeting saying oops

1290
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:46,260
this is not what I had in mind

1291
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,230
and the CEO boards you're like mmm

1292
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,310
don't think this person's going to be

1293
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,350
what we need and to me that that's

1294
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,480
horrible and then that person tells

1295
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,270
other people don't do it you know it is

1296
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,800
a matter of really learning and

1297
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,990
understanding what's going on at the

1298
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,790
organization again what they're trying

1299
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,410
to accomplish what the revenue model is

1300
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,150
who's on the board what their challenges

1301
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,530
and opportunities are and what they need

1302
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:11,730
you to do so use those four lists about

1303
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,490
ideas but you do need to do more due

1304
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,560
diligence but I think ideally through

1305
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,320
people you know and organizations you

1306
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,960
know and if you asked five organizations

1307
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,350
learn but at least one would be begging

1308
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,910
you it's most nonprofits are you know as

1309
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,130
I work with candidates there's there's

1310
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,920
not a non-profit that's closed to me if

1311
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,869
I'm going to introduce someone that

1312
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:39,300
meets what they need that's my job is to

1313
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,090
figure so they're they're all looking

1314
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,150
and you guys bring a lot to the table so

1315
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,859
it's just finding the right match just

1316
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:50,840
the thoughts on purpose

1317
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,820
not working very very loud was here in

1318
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:04,270
the back hello okay

1319
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:08,660
so a little different question I had the

1320
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,880
great opportunity to be on a board for

1321
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,740
two years as a treasurer so treasurer

1322
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,530
elect treasurer the second year and then

1323
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,900
immediately after that it was quite

1324
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,609
exhausting so I didn't really understand

1325
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:22,840
she's nothing the houses yes nonprofit

1326
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,310
how much work there was to be done and I

1327
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,170
was happy to do it but you know I had

1328
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,720
really young kids and everybody gets

1329
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,359
that here right most people do so and

1330
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:34,520
they immediately came back and said okay

1331
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,830
we've we're nominating you you've been

1332
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:42,950
nominated for president elect yes and it

1333
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,869
just for a myriad of reasons personal

1334
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:46,609
and you know I just didn't feel like

1335
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,890
because I had two years on the board as

1336
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,109
a treasurer that I really still had a

1337
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:53,900
good grasp of the operations and I

1338
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,880
really kind of wanted to learn more in a

1339
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,040
different role as well maybe a community

1340
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,660
role or communications or what have you

1341
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,460
before I stepped into that present role

1342
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,369
and so I respectfully declined it and

1343
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:07,970
then you know was was actively trying to

1344
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,510
pursue something else and it kind of

1345
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:14,839
hurt me and so I was my question is is

1346
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,180
that is there some other way I should

1347
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,010
have handled that is there you know in

1348
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,080
the course of being on the board and I

1349
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,490
know there's some natural progression it

1350
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,619
doesn't necessarily mean that I want to

1351
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,570
go to the top or I want to do everything

1352
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,320
on that board

1353
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,130
some people do but you know I guess it

1354
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,200
just really disappointed me that it's

1355
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,940
see it seems like I didn't take that

1356
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,369
next step and they you know wouldn't

1357
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:38,810
allow me to do anything else after that

1358
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,450
and another organization or is it at

1359
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:44,720
this nonprofit so it was a national one

1360
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,970
yeah so it was it all women

1361
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,579
okay sorry

1362
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,000
but yeah I just didn't know if that was

1363
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,250
if you know if I did something you know

1364
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,320
was there some other expectation I could

1365
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,770
have said or um every organization is

1366
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,990
different it's perfectly reasonable to

1367
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:10,920
say

1368
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,670
I mean cheer of a board I have such

1369
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,500
respect for people who do that it is a

1370
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,369
massive yes I mean I finesse and I

1371
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:23,400
haven't in his massive commitment and

1372
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,329
I've done other leadership roles and I

1373
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:29,040
built and run social enterprises very

1374
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,440
successful ones so and I was a good CEO

1375
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,660
but it's humbling when you realize that

1376
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,849
you can't maximize an organization's

1377
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:37,880
potential without a grade forward and

1378
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,930
it's also the case that it's if you have

1379
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,260
a great CEO but not a good board you're

1380
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,880
not going to achieve that organization's

1381
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,680
greater potential but if you have a

1382
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,099
great chair and a weak CEO that can be

1383
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:56,280
fixed I mean really the chair really has

1384
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,530
the greatest opportunity to really make

1385
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,349
make or break a non-profit in so many

1386
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:06,780
ways so it's a huge responsibility the

1387
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,069
fact that you didn't take it should not

1388
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:10,349
you know but every culture and group of

1389
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:12,060
people's girlfriend its group dynamics

1390
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,490
but no and everybody we're treasurer to

1391
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,990
look for you they're not that good to

1392
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:17,760
happen with men in the room but it's

1393
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,060
just unfortunate that these things still

1394
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,450
happen

1395
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,219
[Music]

1396
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,280
with your top loader right yeah I'm not

1397
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,500
going to do it I would say listen if

1398
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,060
you're not bad enough for the women

1399
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,680
you're not well give her a bit wardroom

1400
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,580
that's diversity - yeah so thanks again

1401
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,670
I echo your comments earlier it's been a

1402
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,590
really good conversation I have sort of

1403
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:50,250
it may be a different way in I started

1404
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,720
my own nonprofit because there was a

1405
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,150
need in the community in the area that

1406
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,330
I'm interested in serving and so I have

1407
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,910
the jar but it's teeny tiny and we've

1408
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,530
had some grants and we've grown but I'm

1409
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,060
wondering if you could talk about people

1410
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,240
you may have seen in in their progress

1411
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,160
from like their own startup nonprofit to

1412
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,130
joining more national and bigger

1413
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,270
organizations cuz my experience I don't

1414
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,240
have mentors randomly that I've worked

1415
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,950
with and sponsors and people who help me

1416
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,560
but it's all kind of been make it up as

1417
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,300
I go along and be interesting to know

1418
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,590
how do you bridge from that kind of

1419
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,360
scenario to one where you're on a

1420
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,600
national board so you're often on profit

1421
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,760
is there any pain nap or you do it all

1422
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,950
we we do it all we have a grant that's

1423
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:35,210
been paid paying some of our board and

1424
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,250
volunteer formally volunteer members

1425
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,530
just do some of the deliverables of the

1426
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,080
grant that yeah all volunteer

1427
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,460
organizations are really tough and often

1428
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,460
can't get to the next level until until

1429
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,410
that happened until there's a paid

1430
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:56,040
executive director but but doing

1431
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,960
incredibly important work it's the same

1432
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,790
as anyone else in this room and what

1433
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:05,130
Sheila said with regard to for-profit

1434
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,590
saying with nonprofits think about you

1435
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,180
know like my grandchildren call them

1436
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,760
superpowers think about what you're

1437
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,900
really good at

1438
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,610
you're clearly entrepreneurial

1439
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,410
innovative for problem-solve our

1440
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,180
understanding certain issues and these

1441
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:22,290
in the community to understand what and

1442
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,960
I bet just one aspect of you that I

1443
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,490
think it's kind of apparent from what

1444
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:30,090
you've done for each of you think about

1445
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,710
what strengths you bring to the table

1446
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,780
and how you've demonstrated them because

1447
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,850
that's the conversation

1448
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,740
she was talking about this is what I'm

1449
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,010
good at and this is why this is what I

1450
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,420
can tell you about what I've done so

1451
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,130
that you'll understand that and then

1452
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,650
then in exploring organizations through

1453
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,620
conversations I mean it's organisations

1454
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,240
you read about in the paper you know or

1455
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,630
online I should say look at who's on the

1456
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,370
board look at what they do look at their

1457
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,590
revenue model by looking at their 990s

1458
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,830
to revise start and think about gee do I

1459
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,710
think I could potentially be useful and

1460
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:11,240
then approach them here we'll take one

1461
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,569
more question

1462
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,490
thank you so much this has just been a

1463
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,100
great conversation and you briefly

1464
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,190
touched on the time commitment can you

1465
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,110
elaborate a little bit more about what

1466
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,150
to expect of trying to insert yourself

1467
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,860
into board positions while still trying

1468
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,660
to manage a full time career and a

1469
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:51,759
family who are you asking both oh yes

1470
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,900
well first wife and really bad allergies

1471
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,550
I'm not sick by the way so she won't

1472
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:02,500
talk to me afterwards I'm not sick um

1473
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,390
you know there's just no such thing as

1474
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,220
balance I don't think right one day

1475
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,870
you're going to have ninety ten and the

1476
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,340
next they're going to have forty sixty

1477
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:15,200
in ten nine to the next day so you have

1478
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,180
you know we all do stuff but we want to

1479
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,480
get them

1480
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:27,079
now plans that sounds like a tweet and

1481
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,660
overall you can hear me Moaning she

1482
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,359
Admiral honey along the right I just

1483
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:35,779
comment on that a little bit so I work

1484
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:38,900
for a bank in Wilmington Delaware we're

1485
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,989
out here okay I just wanted I just

1486
01:02:41,989 --> 01:02:43,999
wanted to comment on this question

1487
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:46,190
because it's very difficult to find time

1488
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,109
to do all of these things I was a

1489
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:50,059
chairman of board of communities and

1490
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:52,130
communities in schools of Delaware for

1491
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:55,609
four years and it's a lot of work but

1492
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:58,579
lots of times your employer will allow

1493
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:01,460
you time to do that most of my board

1494
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,200
meetings were during the day my

1495
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,729
executive meetings were during the day

1496
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:07,759
and provided I got my work done that was

1497
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:09,710
you know it was encouraged actually

1498
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:12,289
that's I might lawyer to do that make

1499
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,089
sure that you talk to your employer

1500
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:16,220
before you start going before that board

1501
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,680
seat to make sure it's okay because

1502
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,430
there's there's nothing worse than being

1503
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,349
offered a board seat and then you go

1504
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:27,759
back to your employer they're like and

1505
01:03:27,759 --> 01:03:33,319
that is really bad for your brand and

1506
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,119
while you do it you're going to add some

1507
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,930
to about matching funds and or if it's

1508
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,519
not a formal policy they would

1509
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:43,880
potentially provide some financial

1510
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,710
support to organizations where you're

1511
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,989
involved on the board I know the big

1512
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:50,420
four recently in their benefit package

1513
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,329
says that they'll pay for your board

1514
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,339
seat so that whatever financial funds

1515
01:03:55,339 --> 01:03:56,390
you know you know we're talking about

1516
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,190
nonprofits you cannot pay for your car

1517
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:03,440
I've worked on right so actually looks

1518
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,299
kind of to wrap it up maybe if I can ask

1519
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,489
both that she'll on Alex what are your

1520
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:10,130
final words that you would give us women

1521
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:12,259
today so many advice right Robbie

1522
01:04:12,259 --> 01:04:14,660
beginning all I mean obviously all

1523
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,700
starts as I just started talking but I'm

1524
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,509
so sorry about John have a plan have

1525
01:04:20,509 --> 01:04:23,329
some patience there's no easy way to

1526
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:26,839
that corporate boardroom but you're good

1527
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:31,549
enough go get it I like to go get it

1528
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:34,850
team and I would say that and

1529
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,940
management is a massive yeah you know I

1530
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,770
raised children working full-time I have

1531
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:43,430
grandchildren I'm very very involved if

1532
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:47,120
you know this and my two of my daughters

1533
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,220
have children and yeah I mean they work

1534
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,900
full-time so it's the one at a law firm

1535
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,590
so that's um anyhow yeah

1536
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:58,910
it's a lot so so we know that I think as

1537
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:01,130
I said earlier nonprofit board service

1538
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,690
is one of the most incredible

1539
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,480
opportunities of a lifetime to do

1540
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,220
something meaningful but to grow and

1541
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,290
develop personally and it is it is

1542
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:12,010
absolutely transformational for people

1543
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:16,280
most importantly make sure it's a good

1544
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,260
fit take the time that it takes to do

1545
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,180
that meet the people on the board go on

1546
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,240
site visits whatever it takes and in the

1547
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,550
mean time in terms of exploring start

1548
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,770
asking people you will be so surprised

1549
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,230
how many people are serving on nonprofit

1550
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,720
boards and have a lot to say and if

1551
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,040
you're in this room you're a curious

1552
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,120
person because you're a highly

1553
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,580
accomplished person it's the journey

1554
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,520
itself is at least half the fun you will

1555
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,130
learn so much about what's out there you

1556
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:46,850
will learn about yourself and you know I

1557
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,800
as the reason I think it's important

1558
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,420
when I work with candidates this journey

1559
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,720
is because this is not what they do

1560
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,970
full-time how could they possibly

1561
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,470
imagine all of the possibilities and

1562
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,870
I've worked with hundreds and hundreds

1563
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,570
of nonprofits but every month I come

1564
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,280
across and meet with and visit with a

1565
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,770
nonprofit and I think who would imagine

1566
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,620
that you exist where you combine this

1567
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,690
and that approach to solve this or that

1568
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:14,120
problem no one could even imagine it so

1569
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,610
you you'll be surprised at what's out

1570
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:19,730
there and and you will find something if

1571
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,080
you really want to look for if you

1572
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,720
absolutely will so as if you don't mind

1573
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,520
I have one last pot ever before we

1574
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,750
adjourn and

1575
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,510
oh he said have a plan and you talked

1576
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,040
about some really inspiring things that

1577
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,040
we can do as we look for nonprofit

1578
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,200
opportunities but where you go to start

1579
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,760
your plan are there any resources or

1580
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,050
things that you can tell people out

1581
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,540
where you can see what what kind of plan

1582
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,609
you need to have either 20 30 40 50

1583
01:06:43,609 --> 01:06:45,470
years old you want to be on board some

1584
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,210
digs where do you start that time well

1585
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,010
it would depend if it's a for-profit or

1586
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:52,310
nonprofit right so do you know where

1587
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:55,670
nonprofits would go well where would you

1588
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:59,900
go to create a plan I I think I'll like

1589
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,780
with anything read learn about the

1590
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,040
issues you care about about

1591
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,589
organizations definitely as Lauren said

1592
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:07,819
I mean everyone in this room is

1593
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:10,760
volunteering in some capacity I've

1594
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,400
always seen that your volunteer career

1595
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,859
as parallel to your work career and it's

1596
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:18,589
a inter career path I did career

1597
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:21,770
counseling long time ago and it's a

1598
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,270
career path and you learn about yourself

1599
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:26,359
with each engagement what you like and

1600
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:28,310
what you don't like and you develop

1601
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,380
different skill sets and oh one of the

1602
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,880
other things I love about volunteering

1603
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,700
or nonprofit board service is you work

1604
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,329
with people usually hopefully from very

1605
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:40,880
different backgrounds on a mission that

1606
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,310
you're all very passionate about so you

1607
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,930
get to work with people you might not

1608
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:47,359
meet or know in other parts of your life

1609
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,260
and that's really fabulous - is there

1610
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,119
anything you be more specific that means

1611
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,130
we can offer you to people in the

1612
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,160
resource right okay so obviously for

1613
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,260
corporate boards coming to women in the

1614
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:01,670
boardroom

1615
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:04,490
I would Google the nonprofit one right I

1616
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,780
can't imagine that it's really going to

1617
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,970
be that that much I mean you do have to

1618
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,109
figure out what is it that you're

1619
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:11,589
interested in what are you good at it's

1620
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,990
not it's not as complicated is it the

1621
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,130
question right and my answer to that is

1622
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,870
I'm sorry I just I'm not a

1623
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,910
self-promoting kind of person to really

1624
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,069
but I put my first book addresses that

1625
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,569
first question is called leveraging

1626
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,880
goodwill strengthening nonprofits by

1627
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,520
engaging businesses and it is about

1628
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,198
businesspeople trying to find the right

1629
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,540
non-profit board match it's about the

1630
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,310
role of nonprofit boards building better

1631
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,330
boards

1632
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,920
so that's called leverage and goodwill

1633
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,830
it's on Amazon and I and this book which

1634
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,589
was just amazing to research and write

1635
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,800
is a great background for both nonprofit

1636
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,880
and for-profit boards it's and it's easy

1637
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,130
to read I was telling aadmi who said

1638
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,810
she's about to read it if you read the

1639
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,700
first chapter and last chapter tells you

1640
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,660
the whole story

1641
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,850
and then the inside tractor's ones on

1642
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,380
climate ones on human rights which

1643
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,979
includes privacy and privacy issues and

1644
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:09,899
security issues

1645
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:12,450
and that and trafficking a whole mix of

1646
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,700
things education health care the

1647
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,899
different chapters on different issues

1648
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:17,580
so you can pick and choose and read them

1649
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,109
in whatever order you like but I think

1650
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:21,569
both of those would be very good and all

1651
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:22,859
the companies I write about have

1652
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,750
partnerships with nonprofits so it will

1653
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,240
help you understand a lot of the realm

1654
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,399
of Mount profits and that when you're on

1655
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,890

1656
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,450
