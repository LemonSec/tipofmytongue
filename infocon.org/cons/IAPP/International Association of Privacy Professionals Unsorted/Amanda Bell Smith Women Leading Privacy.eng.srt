1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,970
incredible understanding as an

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,490
environment in which you work ready so

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,700
in your company you can't always come

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,610
into the second and say oh my god for

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,139
this risk it could be four percent of

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,269
global income right you have to do that

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,010
we have to get after you can't always

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,830
see that I call up the sky and fall to

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,240
Chicken Little right because you must

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,670
get their attention anyways get it in a

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,590
short period of time but you probably

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,630
won't if you keep doing that package do

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,310
not going to continue to sustain their

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,810
attention and continue to contract

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,510
privacy and your security and so what

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,360
you really meant will understand this

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,969
the big cuddle bar into a cement not

18
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,410
just your privacy and information

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,270
security you can raise those up and hot

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,030
level in some visibility those that

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,129
don't become sort of manage Mulder and

22
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,620
you have to stand back and say really

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,850
where do your privacy and make the

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,579
committee reported it in relation to all

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,899
the risk immunity impressions are

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,140
natural international environment and so

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,059
