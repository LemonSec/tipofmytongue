1
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,750
thank you Scott hello everyone what an

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,420
Uzi place this is you're like the center

3
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,669
of the universe right here except yeah

4
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,080
except the living room in Moscow where

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,370
Edward Snowden is but it's it's it's

6
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,370
great to be here and talk to you and

7
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,390
about the very hot issues that under for

8
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,710
the courts in the law relating to

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,250
privacy and related matters but I

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,049
thought I would come at it through the

11
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,790
through the root of the Supreme Court

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,250
and I'm sure one question on your mind

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,010
is who's my favorite Supreme Court

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,710
justice now this is a somewhat difficult

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,440
question because I had a favorite

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,560
Supreme Court justice for many years but

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
unfortunately he's gone that's David

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,580
Souter I love David Souter because he

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,400
was just so weird and I mean in a group

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,070
of basically computer professionals

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,360
you'll be pleased to know that one of

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,820
the Supreme Court justices didn't have a

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,490
computer didn't have a cell phone didn't

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,740
have an answering machine on his dial

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,340
phone in his house he lived this sort of

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,130
19th century existence he doesn't like

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,520
electric light he moves his chair around

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,290
his chambers over the course of the day

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,390
to catch the sunlight he eats the same

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,080
thing for for lunch every day he has a

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,350
cup of yogurt in an apple including the

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,330
core which is disgusting when you think

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,480
about it but anyway justice Souter I

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,070
thought always had a wonderful

35
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,780
perspective on what it meant to be a

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,340
Supreme Court justice because the

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
Supreme Court is at once a very public

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,479
and important institution but it's also

39
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,420
an institution where people don't know

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,519
much about it people don't know much

41
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,288
about the justices don't know who they

42
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,980
are don't know what can I just tell the

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,629
folks who are running the conference my

44
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,090
little clock is running and I don't know

45
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,319
well you know after two or three hours

46
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,620
you might get tired of me so there it is

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,380
there it's not

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,160
sorry to say I knew that we'd get it

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,630
back to justice Souter justice Souter

50
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,830
you know he had this great perspective

51
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,570
because you know they're they're famous

52
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,240
but largely unknown and and he sometimes

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,350
would have a little fun with that and

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,400
I'll give you I'll give you an example

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,660
now for reasons that remain obscure

56
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,430
David Souter and Stephen Breyer our

57
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,290
frequently mistaken for each other now

58
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,250
if you know what they look like they

59
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,750
really don't look anything alike but it

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,420
happens to both of them all the time and

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,580
not long ago justice Souter as he often

62
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,460
did was driving from here in Washington

63
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,810
to his home in New Hampshire and he

64
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,820
stopped in a little restaurant

65
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,660
Massachusetts to get something to eat

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,820
he's sitting there and a couple came up

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,290
to him and the guy said I know you

68
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,900
you're on the Supreme Court right to the

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,460
ice is it your Stephen Breyer right and

70
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,630
sue didn't want to embarrass to fellow

71
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,430
in front of his wife so he says yes I'm

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,440
Stephen Breyer they're chatting for a

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,620
little while but then he says so Justice

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,500
Breyer uh one thing I always wanted to

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,970
know the question Souter wasn't ready

76
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,730
for he said it so Justice Breyer what's

77
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,010
the best thing about being on the

78
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,110
Supreme Court he thought for a minute

79
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,850
and he said I have to say it's the

80
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,730
privilege of serving with David Souter

81
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,920
now how can you not love a guy like that

82
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,290
right but he's gone now and I got a bit

83
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,670
it's all right so let's talk about the

84
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,410
Supreme Court by the numbers for a

85
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,870
minute are you you have six men and

86
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,820
three women first time in history there

87
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,550
are three women on the Supreme Court

88
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,950
there are six Catholics and three Jews

89
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,440
there are no Protestants on the Supreme

90
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,150
Court first time in history for that

91
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,030
there are representatives of for New

92
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,550
York City boroughs on the Supreme Court

93
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,100
you have Sonia Sotomayor from the Bronx

94
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,020
Antonin Scalia from Queens Ruth Ginsburg

95
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,420
from Brooklyn and Elena Kagan from

96
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,320
Manhattan tragically staten island is

97
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,520
unrepresented on the Supreme Court but

98
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,070
perhaps future appointments will address

99
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,310
that anyway those are I hope some

100
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,380
interesting facts about the Supreme

101
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,700
Court but I don't think they are really

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,670
terribly important here's an important

103
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,120
fact about the Supreme Court there are

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,180
five Republicans and for Democrats I'm

105
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,160
going to talk for somewhat longer not

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,430
two or three hours but

107
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,680
going to talk for somewhat longer but

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,900
you now know most of what you need to

109
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,490
know about the United States Supreme

110
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,500
Court there are five Republicans and

111
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,130
four Democrats and you know we sometimes

112
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,130
believe we sometimes hope that the court

113
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,490
is a refuge from the partisan politics

114
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,680
that we're so familiar with on the other

115
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,540
side of first street in the capital or

116
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,190
in the race to the White House and

117
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,060
perhaps at some glorious time in the

118
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,480
past that was true but it is certainly

119
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,410
not true now the partisan disagreements

120
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,440
that that roiled the country that

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,410
prevent you know people like the really

122
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,090
distinguished nominee for assistant

123
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,100
attorney general for civil rights who

124
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,380
was tragically i think projected by the

125
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,840
senate yesterday meaning those sorts of

126
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,660
fights they take place in the supreme

127
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,100
court as just as they take place in

128
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,250
Congress and to see why this moment in

129
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,110
the history of the Supreme Court is so

130
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,990
important this closely divided but

131
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,470
Republican majority the last time it's

132
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,930
important to look back at the last time

133
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,820
in the Supreme Court was not evenly

134
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,770
divided the last time there was a very

135
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,870
clear ideological majority on the

136
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,330
Supreme Court and that was in the mid

137
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,330
and late 1960s when towards the end of

138
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,070
World War ins 10 years chief justice

139
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,860
when there was a solid liberal majority

140
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,110
there were seven liberals on the court

141
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,000
and there really was a liberal agenda

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,760
that the courts you know the Supreme

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,860
Court was pushing in a year after year

144
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,050
you saw dramatic movements of the law to

145
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,900
the left very very intentionally 1964

146
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,780
New York Times against Sullivan Justice

147
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,880
Brennan is famous opinion that a changed

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,320
libel law and gave you the press

149
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,220
important new protections 1965 griswold

150
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,080
versus connecticut Justice William O

151
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,390
Douglas is famous opinion that created a

152
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,850
constitutional right to privacy said

153
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,130
that married couples could no longer be

154
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,010
forbidden from buying birth control 1966

155
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,150
old Warren's decision in

156
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,430
versus Arizona the case that

157
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,590
revolutionized Criminal Procedure and

158
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,720
perhaps more importantly change

159
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,770
television dramas forever I like the one

160
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,300
right everybody knows they have right

161
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,210
right to remain silent 1967 perhaps the

162
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,760
best named case in the history of the

163
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,370
Supreme Court loving versus Virginia

164
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,800
what was the case of loving about loving

165
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,570
versus Virginia of course it was the

166
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,700
case about marriage it was the case that

167
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,480
said that the states could no longer ban

168
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,790
racial intermarriage think about that in

169
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,370
1967 there are people in this room who

170
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,730
were alive in 1967 I think I'm right

171
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,160
about that and yeah it wasn't until

172
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,170
nineteen sixty seven that the Supreme

173
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,560
Court got around to saying that Rachel

174
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,590
intermarriage bands were

175
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,730
unconstitutional of course a decision

176
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,030
that's much in the law in the news today

177
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,740
because of a similar fight going on

178
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,020
about same-sex marriage but you know it

179
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,180
is worth remembering that in nineteen

180
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,640
sixty when barack obama's parents got

181
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,480
married in hawaii their marriage was a

182
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,780
crime in 19 states and there were people

183
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,820
in prison in this country for that crime

184
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,640
at that time so it is worth celebrating

185
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,980
frankly that the country has come so far

186
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,070
that laws like that are not only

187
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,960
unconstitutional but they are literally

188
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,300
unthinkable but you know the changes you

189
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,040
never know how change is going to come

190
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,420
up the supreme court because you never

191
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,090
know when justices are going to leave

192
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,650
when richard nixon became president in

193
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,710
1969 four justices left in quick

194
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,870
succession you know jimmy carter is the

195
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,090
only president in american history to

196
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,679
serve a full term and just have no

197
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,059
appointments to the quarter because they

198
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,100
were there were no vacancies but richard

199
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,289
nixon was only president for five and a

200
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,360
half years you'll recall he had to leave

201
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,290
early but he got four appointments to

202
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,480
the Supreme Court and and who left Earl

203
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,090
Warren left John Harlan left Hugo black

204
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,610
left and eighty-four de Sol left and who

205
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,880
did Richard Nixon a he named Warren

206
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,770
Berger Chief Justice Harry Blackmun

207
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,430
Lewis

208
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,620
how and william rehnquist and as you

209
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,010
think about Richard Nixon's appointments

210
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,040
to the Supreme Court it tells you

211
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,540
something about the Supreme Court but it

212
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,370
tells you something even more important

213
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,410
and this is this is something that you

214
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,959
know I think cannot be overemphasized

215
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,529
and that is the most important political

216
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,290
development of our lifetime which is the

217
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,510
evolution of the republican party the

218
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,680
republican party of the 1970s is

219
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,430
unrecognizably different from the

220
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,800
Republican Party of today it was

221
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,100
basically a moderate party it was not a

222
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,170
religiously oriented party was not a

223
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,080
socially conservative party and when

224
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,730
Nixon had all those appointments to the

225
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,920
Supreme Court people thought oh the

226
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,630
court is going to move dramatically to

227
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,750
the right but it didn't and and the 70

228
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,180
Supreme Court were nearly as liberal as

229
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,300
the 60s think about the big decisions of

230
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,160
that period had the Nixon tapes case

231
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,720
where they essentially forced Nixon out

232
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,000
of office Pentagon Papers case they

233
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,020
approved school busing in 1972 they

234
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,029
edited the death penalty in the United

235
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:09,420
States though they let it back in in

236
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,570
1976 and still the most controversial

237
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,630
decision of the mall 1973 Roe vs. Wade

238
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,750
the K the case that said states could no

239
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,200
longer ban abortion was a 722 opinion

240
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,810
and the only two dissenters in roe v

241
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,740
wade were william rehnquist and byron ye

242
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,870
who was appointed by President Kennedy

243
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,240
so three of the four Republican

244
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,580
appointees to the court Nixon appointees

245
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,890
to the court were in the majority in roe

246
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,000
v wade simply unthinkable in today's

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,270
Republican Party the big a change of

248
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,010
course began in nineteen eighty with the

249
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,500
election of Ronald Reagan who brought

250
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,420
with him to Washington someone who is I

251
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,640
think a very underrated figure in recent

252
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,649
American history and that's edwin meese

253
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,690
edwin meese he was an advisor to the

254
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,190
president reagan later the Attorney

255
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,829
General and if he said look there has

256
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,070
been a liberal agenda at the Supreme

257
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,550
Court for a long time we need a

258
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,200
conservative agenda and

259
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,300
in appointing lower court judges in

260
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,370
enforcing the law edwin meese really

261
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,710
started to bring out this agenda so what

262
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,480
was that agenda expand executive power

263
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,160
and racial preferences intended to

264
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
assist african-american speedup

265
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,060
executions lower the barriers between

266
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:34,450
church and state and above all overturn

267
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,670
roe v wade and allow states once again

268
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,940
to ban abortion baby part of the Reagan

269
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,830
Revolution is it sometimes calls with

270
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,170
the arrival in Washington of a group of

271
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,710
aggressive young conservative lawyers

272
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,620
two of whom were John Roberts and Samuel

273
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,180
Alito and I think that is worth

274
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,020
remembering about who they were and who

275
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,370
they are but the Republican Party of

276
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,170
Ronald Reagan was certainly not the

277
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,630
Republican Party of today either and you

278
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,580
saw that in Reagan appointments to the

279
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,590
Supreme Court during the campaign of

280
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,270
1980 Reagan made a promise that campaign

281
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,580
promise that Jimmy Carter didn't he can

282
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,740
make Reagan said if I have the chance I

283
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,840
will appoint the first woman to the

284
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,450
Supreme Court 1981 Potter Stewart

285
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,950
unexpectedly announced that he was

286
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,600
leaving the court so Reagan said it was

287
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,260
people look I made a promise keep it

288
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,430
finally a qualified woman for the

289
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,860
quarter it was not frankly that easy in

290
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,770
1981 there were not as many women in

291
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,750
prominent positions in the law

292
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,210
especially Republican women so Reagan's

293
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,670
people had to go all the way to the

294
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,100
intermediate appeals court in Arizona

295
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,620
not even the highest court in Arizona to

296
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,020
find the remarkable figure who was and

297
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,590
is Sandra Day O'Connor and at the time

298
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,710
it was clear that justice O'Connor was

299
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,000
not a social conservative was not a

300
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
hardcore conservative she was a moderate

301
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,890
as she remained during her entire tenant

302
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,110
extremely consequential tenure on the

303
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,770
court and that was fine with Ronald

304
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,030
Reagan and and that again tells you

305
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,090
where the Republican Party was 1986

306
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,370
Chief Justice burger stepped down Reagan

307
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,810
elevating William Rehnquist from

308
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,920
Associate Justice to Chief Justice

309
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,630
a Ronald and Antonin Scalia was named to

310
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,209
fill that see no question conservative

311
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,380
justice said conservative justice now

312
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,420
again just a point that I think is

313
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,449
especially relevant to the work that you

314
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,070
do is that the conservative movement in

315
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,459
the courts by and large is a more

316
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:52,220
authoritarian conservative movement than

317
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,769
a libertarian conservative movement you

318
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,630
know that that's a real split in the

319
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,910
contemporary Republican Party between

320
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,630
the sort of Rand Paul libertarians and

321
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,350
the more traditional you know Pro law

322
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,600
enforcement wing of the Republican Party

323
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,550
well at least as far as the courts are

324
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,990
concerned it is very much the

325
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,490
authoritarian wing of the party so as

326
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,320
you think about Republicans on the

327
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,660
Supreme Court they are largely a

328
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,199
pro-government suspicious of civil

329
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,470
liberties claim kind of Republicans that

330
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,850
was certainly true of Reagan's

331
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,190
appointments it's and as you'll see it's

332
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,029
certainly true of george w bush's

333
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,380
appointments as well so 1986 Scalia goes

334
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,890
on the court 1987 a key moment in the

335
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,390
history of the Supreme Court you know

336
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,420
ever since the war in court as i said

337
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,100
the courts been evenly divided and

338
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,019
there's been one swing justice one

339
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,779
justice in the middle who decides the

340
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,860
outcome of a lot of cases and in the 80s

341
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,970
it was Lewis Powell so Powell left in 87

342
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,510
and that left a key vacancy on the court

343
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,850
in what in Ronald Reagan do he nominated

344
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,029
Robert work and the country really for

345
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,769
the only time in our lifetime had a

346
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,779
national conversation about what the

347
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,880
Constitution man because it worked was

348
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,220
brilliant bore was accomplished he was

349
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,260
prolific he's an honorable man but he's

350
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,420
very very conservative and he had said

351
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,220
things like the civil rights act was a

352
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,019
monstrous thing and there was no right

353
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,170
to privacy in the Constitution and

354
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,529
that something important had happened

355
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,110
between the confirmation of Scalia and

356
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,180
the nomination of Borg the following

357
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,329
year in the midterm elections of 1986

358
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,750
the Democrats we took a control of the

359
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,360
United States Senate and so the chairman

360
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,880
of the Judiciary Committee in 1987 was

361
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
no longer Strom Thurmond of South

362
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,320
Carolina but instead a young senator

363
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,350
from Delaware named Joseph Biden and

364
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,029
Biden engineered hearings on Bork that

365
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,860
really were a searching inquiry into

366
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,800
Bork's views and Bork's view probably to

367
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,839
his dismay he answered all their

368
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,490
questions he didn't dodge them the way

369
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,889
subsequent nominees have and the court

370
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,269
this is the Senate said it to be

371
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,750
conservative and he was voted down 58 to

372
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,060
42 in Ronald Reagan facing political

373
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,449
reality nominated someone who was not as

374
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:25,230
conservative and that was Anthony

375
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,690
Kennedy who is no liberal but is

376
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,880
certainly not as conservative work would

377
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,790
be and that really set the stage for the

378
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,640
ring for the rehnquist Court which I

379
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,860
wrote about in my in my book the nine

380
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,670
and you know when I started work on the

381
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,529
nine I was inspired by a book that I'm

382
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:44,940
sure is familiar to some of you the

383
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,370
Brethren by Bob Woodward which was

384
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,170
really the first behind-the-scenes book

385
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,750
on the Supreme Court which said that you

386
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,630
know the court had all sorts of terrible

387
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,760
internal rivalries everybody didn't like

388
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,560
Warren burger if you know anything about

389
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,449
the history of the Supreme Court a lot

390
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,100
of the justices have hated each other

391
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,890
over the years you know William O

392
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,049
Douglas a cantankerous liberal who

393
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:09,179
served on the court longer than anyone

394
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,400
in history one summer he had a car

395
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,589
accident drove was a car off of a cliff

396
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,929
in Washington State the first question

397
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,910
everybody asked fact the Supreme Court

398
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,099
was where was Felix Frankfurter at the

399
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,510
time because they hated each other so

400
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,339
much but Rehnquist was very popular

401
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,190
among his colleagues why well he

402
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,070
engineered a tremendous reduction in the

403
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,010
courts workload in the 80s the Supreme

404
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,409
Court was deciding about 150 cases a

405
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,360
year

406
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,270
and by the 90 but by the time rink was

407
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,020
died in 2005 they were deciding about 72

408
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,340
cases a year do the math 70 cases / 9

409
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,000
justices / for law clerks apiece it's a

410
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,010
cushy job being on the Supreme Court no

411
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,780
wonder they live so long right in the

412
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,780
80s there was a proposal to add there

413
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,280
was so much work for the Supreme Court

414
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,380
to add a sort of a super appeals court

415
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,400
underneath the the Supreme Court and it

416
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,620
went to the White House for evaluation

417
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,299
and the white house counsel at the time

418
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,520
assigned a young lawyer on his staff

419
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,100
named John Roberts to write a memo about

420
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,110
this proposal and this is what young

421
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,960
John Roberts wrote while some of the

422
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,059
tales of woe emanating from the court

423
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,220
are enough to bring tears to the eyes it

424
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,919
is true that only Supreme Court justices

425
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,350
and schoolchildren are expected to and

426
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,510
do take the entire summer off now the

427
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,130
chief justice doesn't talk this way

428
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,140
anymore the summer off looks good from

429
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,120
where any sitting and the court remains

430
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,340
basically a congenial place and while

431
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,530
you are here in Washington I urge you if

432
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,230
you can go see a Supreme Court argument

433
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,850
because it's really the best free show

434
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,830
in town notwithstanding because it's my

435
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,080
remarks here today although hot this is

436
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,299
not created you but and there is of

437
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,169
course one very well known fact about

438
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,929
Supreme Court oral arguments that is

439
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,240
that there are eight justices who are

440
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,030
very engaged and very prepared and asked

441
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,710
lots of hard questions and Clarence

442
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,230
Thomas never says anything now februari

443
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,470
22nd which just passed was the eighth

444
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,140
anniversary eight years since Justice

445
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,530
Thomas last I've asked a question at the

446
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,309
Supreme Court but it is it is true that

447
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,140
he is a full of the full participant in

448
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,549
the courts deliberations and he asked

449
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,440
and he writes as many opinions as anyone

450
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,980
else and the court remains and he's a

451
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,240
congenial member of the court but you

452
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,770
know in thinking about the rehnquist

453
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,230
court it is useful to think about the

454
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,050
court in two departments 1986 22

455
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,640
thousand and two thousand to two

456
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,770
thousand five and the dividing point in

457
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,050
the history of the Supreme Court it in

458
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,930
many respects to this day a dividing

459
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,090
point in the history of our country is

460
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,700
the court's decision in Bush v Gore now

461
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,160
I admit I am somewhat obsessed even

462
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,440
today with Bush v Gore you know Justice

463
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,170
Scalia does a lot of public speaking and

464
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,390
and he often you know gets a kind of

465
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,880
hostile question oh yeah what about bush

466
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,890
v gore and he always says the same thing

467
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,910
Oh get over well I'm not over it you

468
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,370
know when I my last book before the nine

469
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,140
was a book called too close to call I

470
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,730
wrote a whole book about the recount for

471
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,460
that book I tried to interview Al Gore I

472
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,260
really wanted to interview Al Gore talk

473
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,090
about you know interviewing for this

474
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,770
obviously you want to talk to him well

475
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,090
we would talk to me didn't want to

476
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,590
relive the experience so I wrote the

477
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,040
book with that well while I was working

478
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,000
on the nine I I met al gore at a social

479
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,740
occasion and I said you know mr. vice

480
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,360
president you're not going to believe

481
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,960
this I'm writing another book where Bush

482
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,970
v Gore is at the center of it I said I

483
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,280
think I must be the biggest Bush v Gore

484
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,070
junkie in the world and he said to me

485
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,880
you may be seconded uh which you know

486
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,280
you got it you got to give him a not for

487
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,020
that well um as you I believe you know

488
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,270
which one that case and became president

489
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,500
and something important happened at the

490
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,330
Supreme Court from two thousand and two

491
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,550
thousand five but the court moved to the

492
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,550
left the court got more liberal think

493
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,080
about the big decisions of that period

494
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
they ended the death penalty for the

495
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,470
mentally and did the death

496
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,570
penalty for juvenile offenders they

497
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,640
decided Lawrence v Texas the case that

498
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,260
said gay people could no longer be

499
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,790
thrown in prison for having consensual

500
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,750
sex and they rejected the Bush

501
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,420
administration's position on Guantanamo

502
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,740
Bay and the history of and the treatment

503
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,640
of the detainees in there all of them

504
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,000
liberal decisions why because justice

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,460
O'Connor who was the swing vote of that

506
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,450
period became more and more alienated

507
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,059
the modern Republican Party she didn't

508
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:15,789
like John Ashcroft she didn't like the

509
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:17,500
war on terror she didn't like the way

510
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,630
the war in Iraq was being conducted and

511
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,149
above all justice O'Connor was alienated

512
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:23,919
by an event it doesn't get talked about

513
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,350
a lot now but is I think a very

514
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,330
important event in the history of the

515
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,460
last decade which is the Terri Schiavo

516
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,460
case a case about we should make

517
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,500
critical decisions for critically ill

518
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,990
family members and it was precisely that

519
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,149
time that justice O'Connor was dealing

520
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,649
with the sad descent of her beloved

521
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:44,559
husband John into Alzheimer's disease so

522
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,380
it was not it was not just an academic

523
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,130
issue to her and eventually in his

524
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,860
second term George W Bush I did have a

525
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,110
chance to name two justices to the

526
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,090
Supreme Court and very quick succession

527
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,809
and and he named John Roberts and Samuel

528
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:06,130
Alito and finally the modern Republican

529
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,610
Party has his voice on the Supreme Court

530
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,149
and John Roberts is more conservative

531
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,950
than the man he replaced william

532
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,880
rehnquist and Samuel Alito is a lot more

533
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,370
conservative than justice O'Connor whom

534
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,490
he replaced and we see that in the

535
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,460
history of the modern decisions at the

536
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,960
court we have you know so many decisions

537
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,840
we're in a law enforcement with law

538
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,269
enforcement women's the death penalty it

539
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:39,100
is expanded acceptance sort of certain

540
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,610
circumstances certainly the the signal

541
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,169
is the signal decision of the Roberts

542
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,330
Court I think to this day is the

543
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,330
Citizens United case which has greatly

544
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,120
changed campaign finance laws

545
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,490
essentially begun not ended it be gone

546
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,630
the deregulation of American political

547
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,059
campaigns you know the crucial idea that

548
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,909
the Supreme Court has accepted is that

549
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,740
money is speech you know people talk a

550
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,539
lot about the corporations or people

551
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,940
that's actually a fairly minor and even

552
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,340
uncontroversial I

553
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,350
yeah I mean I work for CNN I work for

554
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,539
The New Yorker we are always waving the

555
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,100
First Amendment we want access to

556
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,140
proceedings we say see it as a person

557
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,000
Amendment right what we do corporations

558
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,159
do have First Amendment rights there is

559
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,590
nothing controversial particularly about

560
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,500
that but what is controversial is the

561
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,630
notion that in money is speech the idea

562
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,539
of giving money to a campaign is like

563
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,299
giving a political speech that suggests

564
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,419
that metaphor means that you can't

565
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,340
regulate it just like you can't regulate

566
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,090
speech so the court is in the process of

567
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,750
deregulating American politics on racial

568
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,779
issues this is a court deeply hostile to

569
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,230
a firm ative action in any kind and he

570
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,179
saw that at an extremely important

571
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,279
decision last year where the court

572
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,590
struck down the critical part of the

573
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,090
Voting Rights Act perhaps the most

574
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,460
important civil rights law of the past

575
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,380
50 years which is in many respects now a

576
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,960
non and non any state this law because

577
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,899
of what the Supreme Court did there are

578
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:21,029
exceptions notes people sometimes

579
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,580
described Justice Kennedy as a moderate

580
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,620
that's it that's really a mistake

581
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,929
Justice Kennedy is not a moderate he

582
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,100
actually has very extreme views he just

583
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,659
has somewhat idiosyncratic passions he

584
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,730
is someone who does believe there should

585
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,590
be limits on the death penalty so he

586
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,350
often sides with the four liberals the

587
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,990
four Democratic appointees on death

588
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,909
penalty cases and most importantly

589
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,360
Justice Kennedy is clearly a supporter

590
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,279
of gay rights and there have been three

591
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,919
important three only three decisions

592
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,080
about gay rights in history about issued

593
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,809
by the supreme court if the roamer case

594
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,270
in Colorado Lawrence v Texas which I

595
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,650
mentioned let and

596
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,310
and the the Windsor case striking down

597
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,260
the Defense of Marriage Act last year

598
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,830
all three kanic decisions were written

599
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,930
by Justice Kennedy but no one should

600
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,610
think because of that the Justice

601
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,260
Kennedy is somehow a member of the

602
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,510
liberal wing of the court it's just

603
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,260
simply not the case and the most

604
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,540
important thing any Supreme Court

605
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,840
justice can do is vote with his or her

606
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,290
feet in other words leave because

607
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,640
justices know that their departure gives

608
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,580
a president a chance to put his stamp on

609
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,000
the Supreme Court for a very long time

610
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,610
for the decades-long tenure and the most

611
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,550
important thing you can know about

612
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,850
justice Souter and justice Stevens these

613
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,400
two Republican appointees they gave

614
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,290
their precious seats on the court to a

615
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,170
democrat barack obama and he appointed

616
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,810
Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan and it

617
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,090
is worth pausing to remember as I near

618
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,580
my conclusion here that the last three

619
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,180
justices to leave the Supreme Court

620
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,980
three more different human beings you

621
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,620
will never see Sandra Day O'Connor tis

622
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,960
tall charismatic outgoing former

623
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,840
politician from Arizona David Souter the

624
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,570
shy reclusive bachelor from New

625
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,510
Hampshire John Paul Stevens a wily

626
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,460
antitrust lawyer from from Chicago three

627
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,520
different personalities but they all had

628
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,190
one important thing in common they were

629
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,340
three moderate Republicans who left the

630
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,440
court completely alienated from the

631
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,720
modern Republican Party Souter and

632
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,790
Stephen so alienated that they gave

633
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,130
their see cease to a debt to a

634
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:00,540
democratic resident the blast saw I have

635
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,930
for you is what what is the future of

636
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,480
the Supreme Court well in the best law

637
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,520
school tradition I will answer that

638
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,270
question with a question who's going to

639
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,700
be the next president because that's the

640
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,140
only question that matters

641
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,460
when you think about the history of the

642
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,270
Supreme Court it is we are going to have

643
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,820
one kind of Supreme Court if Barack

644
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,100
Obama is followed by Hillary Clinton who

645
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,680
was followed by andrew Cuomo we're going

646
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,920
to have another kind of Supreme Court if

647
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,290
Marco Rubio is president followed by Ted

648
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,170
Cruz and I leave that thought with you

649
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,360
and look forward and look forward to

650
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,070
watching the future of it all unfold

651
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,149
thanks very much for having
