of power in China this is just a few

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,750
example of the fight on freedom it is

33
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,340
against this backdrop that my

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,369
organization vadera is developing new

35
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,460
tools and model to prevent human rights

36
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,820
violation we give a press community the

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,170
ability to change their reality we

38
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,149
equipped train and support activists we

39
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,760
are building sustainable network that

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,790
using cameras mostly he didn't want to

41
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,760
obtain original video materials in

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,150
places media can't or won't go we are

43
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,340
watching the Watchers we are breaking

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,290
the traditional power structure between

45
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,780
citizens and governments and giving

46
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,970
these communities the ability to hold

47
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,510
the government accountable I want to

48
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,250
start with the story that will reflect

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,349
later on about the current security

50
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,560
situation that we are facing six years

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,550
ago I landed in African country I had in

52
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,580
my bags 200 hidden cameras this was a

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,920
friendly country a democracy but its

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,060
neighborhood country was a dictatorship

55
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,010
my aim was to get these cameras into the

56
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,690
hand of the human rights activist in

57
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,319
this country they needed it document the

58
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,120
abuses that they are suffering from the

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,989
regime the morning after an activist

60
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,450
drove with a car from that country we

61
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,790
met we drove together to the closest

62
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,790
garage

63
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,290
we took the air out of the spare tire

64
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,780
and we feel the hidden cameras inside

65
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,870
this tire and we drove to the border

66
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,099
obviously we've been very anxious and

67
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,019
afraid about what's going to happen even

68
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,109
though we scoped the border before when

69
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,489
we arrived we understand there was no

70
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,989
need really to be in stress it was

71
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,060
hardly a shot at shelter there was two

72
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,739
guys they're very bored they hardly

73
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,079
looked at us stemple passport few

74
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,370
minutes after we've been in this country

75
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,049
and that week this camera were in the

76
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,310
hands of the human rights activists you

77
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,780
probably wonder how come I find myself

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,019
taking cameras to these countries i was

79
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,450
born in israel to a right-wing family

80
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,879
and I wasn't when i was 18 i joined the

81
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,919
israeli army and i serve as an officer

82
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,230
in one day one of the hard mod and

83
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,069
infantry units it was the first time I

84
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,290
came hand in hand to see what that

85
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,510
pupation look like I serve a lot of time

86
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,450
in Gaza and in da cube in the West Bank

87
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,519
and it was just after the first

88
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,290
Palestinian uprising so there was still

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,439
a lot of stress there I came to realize

90
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,750
that the occupation not just harming the

91
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,159
rights of the Palestinian but I also

92
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,289
realized what he doing to our people and

93
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,169
I decided to do what I consider one of

94
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,270
the most patriotic x I can do for my

95
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,250
country and I refuse to serve in the

96
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,070
West Bank and not just that I refuse to

97
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,139
serve in the West Bank I decided they're

98
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,490
going to bring the stories and the

99
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,770
images and things that I saw in the West

100
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,720
Bank to my people because I was not

101
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,909
exposed to them neither of my friend and

102
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:43,159
I wanted to show them how its look like

103
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:47,870
I will share with you few of the of the

104
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,090
video of the visuals from a project I

105
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,580
did with organization called b'tselem

106
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,500
B'Tselem is the Israeli Information

107
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,270
Center for Human Rights and occupied

108
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,380

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,289
organization please check it together we

110
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,449

111
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,310
families that living in the most risky

112
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,610
places close to check points near army

113
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,900
bases and side-by-side with settlers the

114
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,039
images are going to that are going to

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,380
show you can be quite explicit so from

116
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,759
some of you might find it uncomfortable

117
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,110
to watch but they're both the boast

118
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,830
videos were shown in Israeli television

119
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,150
the mask Menuhin is that you going to

120
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,969
see in the first clip or Jewish settlers

121
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,560
minutes before the cameras was torn on

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,930
this settlers approach Palestinian

123
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,599
family that worked their land and they

124
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,650
tell them that they have to leave

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,270
because this land belong to the Jewish

126
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,419
settlers the Palestinian refuse let's

127
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:47,360
see what's happened the mask man you see

128
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,090
our Jewish settlers the approaching

129
00:05:50,090 --> 00:06:12,710
Palestinian family this clip is from

130
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,810
demonstration in the West Bank the guy

131
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,520
in green want to be arrested the guy in

132

the middle going to be arrested in a

133
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,360

handcuffed you're going to be shoot shot

135
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:30,979
in the feet with the rubber bullet as I

136
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,010
said these images when shown in Israel

137
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,270
created a massive debate and they force

138
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,529
the arm in the police to investigate

139
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,990
these events without the cameras in the

140
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,150
hand of this Palestinians this

141
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,270
investigation will never happen thanks

142
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,729
to this project in images like this one

143
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,710
and others we managed to reduce the

144
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,219
level of violence in the West Bank now I

145
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,930
just have to say something this is not a

146
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,000
reflection of the whole Israeli

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,460
occupation this is rare occasion they're

148
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,080
happening any people that do these kind

149
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,770
of things have to be brought to justice

150
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,750
this work in the West Bank and it would

151
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,260
bet Selim got me thinking that this idea

152
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,180
of giving cameras to a press community

153
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,789
can be brought to other places in the

154
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,979
world that we can basically empower

155
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,690
myrcella's communities that living under

156
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,000
dictatorship with the ability to tell

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,320
their story I moved to London and open

158
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,510
organization in London raise a bit of

159
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,169
money and did a very stupid mistake I

160
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,669
thought I can do the same methodology

161
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,169
from the West Bank to other places in

162
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:36,920
the world

163
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,510
took some regular cameras and flew to

164
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,310
one of the countries and start training

165
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,060
people overtly with regular camera quite

166
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,800
fast I start seeing that the Secret

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,140
Service around us we've been followed

168
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,850
I've been followed our phone was stepped

169
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,380
and we understand you can't work in the

170
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,400
same ways in these conditions I wish

171
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
that all the money that we were that we

172
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,450
raised when dr. London my board and my

173
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,190
donor was my donors was very very angry

174
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,050
about me but we had to take it back and

175
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,880
understand how we can really come with

176
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,560
much more sophisticated methods to be

177
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,910
able to address the security in this say

178
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,970
in these conditions this is how we came

179
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,800
to develop our mode of the video model

180
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,020
every project that we are starting is

181
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,490
starting with an in deep research

182
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,830
understanding which images are missing

183
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,680
which stories are not making it out from

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,470
these areas we understanding what the

185
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,960
people that are in place that able to

186
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,450
film these images and where this images

187
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,770
should go to create a positive change

188
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,000
then we partner with the groups on the

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,049
ground and you start giving them

190
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,450
training now our partners are working in

191
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,090
high-risk environment risking their life

192
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,090
this is why security is one of the most

193
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,370
important things for us we're using code

194
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,670
names we Billy buildings cell based

195
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,100
structures with not passing information

196
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,750
through the internet everything is

197
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,080
happening physically and we also give

198
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,210
them hidden cameras to be able to film

199
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,610
in a secure way we're buying cameras off

200
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,230
the shelf roupa de breaking them apart

201
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,600
and we're putting the technology inside

202
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,100
think they can carry in their

203
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,110
environment that they are working in a

204
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,720
lot of the people that we work me we'd

205
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,510
have hardly nothing so sometimes we

206
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,280
putting this technology inside stones

207
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,860
and inside wood inside closer there were

208
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,390
inside bags that they are carrying

209
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,100
anything that they can take in their

210
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,760
environment without the attention of the

211
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
one that I trying to film them it will

212
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,880
blend in the environment but security of

213
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,500
course is going way beyond just filming

214
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,510
with hidden cameras before we doing any

215
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,980
operation we understanding and analyzing

216
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,750
the risk of every location and

217
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,520
rebuilding a back-up plan to make sure

218
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,230
it is something goes wrong we have

219
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,080
solutions

220
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,220
after we getting the footage from the

221
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,430
ground we are focusing on verification

222
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,510
verification is extremely important if

223
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,160
you don't understand the footage if

224
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,310
thoroughly and understand how what it is

225
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,450
happening there and all the context

226
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,310
context around that we can't really use

227
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,590
it that's why we're training the people

228
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,230
that we are working with how to film the

229
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,940
location in a way that we can identify

230
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,030
it filming the road sign building

231
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,400
watches paper so we can then see where

232
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,130
it is we double checking the information

233
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,160
we're looking at maps and you're looking

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,050
at the meta data just when we are sure

235
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,150
that we can trust the information with

236
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,140
distributing it now no story for our

237
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,240
point of view worth nothing if it

238
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,110
doesn't create an impact on the ground

239
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,180
that's why depends on the project that

240
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,950
we are running we're making sure that

241
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,870
the stories that we are getting will end

242
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,150
up in places that can really inflate the

243
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,610
situation this is why sometimes you're

244
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,670
giving the material to governments or to

245
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,740
embassies to create a pressure from

246
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,740
outside sometimes working with lawyer to

247
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,090
use this evidence to choose this

248
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,270
materials as evidence in court many

249
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,010
times you're using the media and we

250
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,020
expose the materials in the media

251
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,670
without taking credit most of the time

252
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,740
all of the time because we are behind

253
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,630
the semi don't want ensures they wander

254
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,730
taking these materials sometimes this

255
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,350
materials going back to the communities

256
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,150
to the activists to be able to make

257
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,890
effective campaigns we have variety of

258
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,240
projects sometimes is working in

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,430
democracy with myrcella's community in

260
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,830
many cases in working in dictatorship

261
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,750
now I'm assuming most of you are living

262
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,610
under democracy so I want to give you

263
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,260
example what it's mean to work in

264
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,370
dictatorship from some reason another

265
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,140
believe it or not dictators love

266
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,200
election it is important for them it's

267
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
important for them to show that they've

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,250
been basically elected by the people and

269
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,650
they will do everything in their hand

270
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,940
and in their power practice all the

271
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,740
power that they have to make sure that

272
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,650
they will win in the election day this

273
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,720
is why election is a good framework for

274
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,630
us to work around now when I'm talking

275
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,430
about election I'm talking just filming

276
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,230
the day and seeing there was a corrupt

277
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,780
during the election this regimes

278
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,490
sometimes spend months sometimes years

279
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,400
to prepare to this election and we want

280
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,590
to be there to understand what methods

281
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,100
they are using to oppress the community

282
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,660
one of our first and biggest project was

283
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,430
in one of the dictators in Africa I

284
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,170
obviously not saying names of countries

285
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,060
for the security of the partners that we

286
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,000
are working with but this was one of the

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,920
dictators that one of the last dictators

288
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,490
is still hold him in a lot 35 years in

289
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,700
this country we build an undercover

290
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,190
networks of 200 people that were spread

291
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,480
across the country in cell-based

292
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,540
structure these people film what the

293
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,570
regime did to make sure they secure the

294
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,760
votes they use variety of methods they

295
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,400
used to push the agenda to churches they

296
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,740
use political motivated militia too

297
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,290
intimidated people they hitchhike food

298
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,660
supply that came from other countries as

299
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,000
a support and didn't gave it until the

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,620
people will sign up that they're going

301
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,540
to vote for them they get them together

302
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,310
in villages when they thought nobody is

303
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,930
seeing and told told them that they know

304
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,950
who they are and they're going to take

305
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,750
revenge if not going to vote for the

306
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,060
right party I want to show you example

307
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,830
of clip how its look like from inside

308
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,710
how this intimidation mechanism worked

309
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,190
haha

310
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,280
this is just stunning a few example from

311
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,780
the materials and the one we can use

312
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,340
without jeopardizing the people that

313
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,920
film this material now this images were

314
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,950
broadcast all over the world we also

315
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,440
made sure that they ends in countries

316
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,330
that are surrounding this dictatorship

317
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,370
and in all the international body that

318
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,770
this country is part of but most

319
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,170
importantly we broadcast these images

320
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,030
and the sound of this images back to the

321
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,130
community because this perpetrator is

322
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,420
that are working in the rural areas

323
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,550
shouldn't nobody see them the thing that

324
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,810
can go there and do whatever they want

325
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,810
and suddenly when they hear their voices

326
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,180
in the radios in the station where

327
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,340
they're practicing and doing this dis

328
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,500
event they got scared and punitive was

329
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,760
broken the readers and somebody is

330
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,410
following them and this immediately

331
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,720
reduced the violence in this area so

332
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,790
thanks to this project and thanks to

333
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,560
this wonderful activists we managed to

334
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,170
create election that was not free but it

335
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,810
was not violence and people were not

336
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,560
killed during this election we continue

337
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,390
to use all kind of creative ways to take

338
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,970
cameras and equipment into countries and

339
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,370
story outs but this coming is getting

340
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,160
harder and harder I came here after was

341
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,780
traveling in eight countries in the last

342
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,360
month in all of them they scan my

343
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,610
fingerprints and took my picture of my

344
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,860
face so now my information is in the

345
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,720
hand of all this government many of them

346
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,280
of course are not really sympathizing

347
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,560
with what we are doing the checkpoint at

348
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,450
I used to pass six years ago very easily

349
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,100
now have the same equipment and we

350
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,240
cannot pass this way anymore as are

351
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,010
moving becoming more scrutinizing the

352
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,570
risk is getting a bigger just last year

353
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,600
200 journalist was arrested this is the

354
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,120
highest second number this is the second

355
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,830
highest number recorded

356
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,590
by the Committee to Protect Journalists

357
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,510
in the last year since the doing their

358
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,780
tallies we are not journalists but we

359
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,850
are facing the same risk if not higher

360
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,790
since 2008 when we cough when we

361
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,620
launched it vedera we trained more than

362
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,960
500 activists that carrying hidden

363
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,010
cameras and filming cross few countries

364
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,570
with a body that less of a 1 million

365
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,090
pound that great go to us with the

366
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,800
generals the nation of high in the v hi

367
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,620
network individuals and foundation we

368
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,990
continue to bring stories out from this

369
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,750
location from places that media can't or

370
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,000
won't go or other organization find it

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,070
very very hard to operate it's the risk

372
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,090
getting higher they need is getting

373
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,310
bigger in the last days here I realize

374
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,540
that security and privacy are actually

375
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,980
twins brothers they're going

376
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,160
hand-in-hand I might know a lot about

377
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,020
security but I don't know much about

378
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,209
privacy and any everyone here I don't

379
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:14,800
know if you realize it or not you are

380
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,470
basically human rights defenders you're

381
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,730
in the fourth front of this struggle

382
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,020
also what I realize in the last two days

383
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,420
here that the conversation is taking

384
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,480
place here is one that is very mind

385
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,790
rotated in the Western thoughts and

386
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,160
practices the reason need to take this

387
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,530
conversation farther to other places in

388
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,580
the world as the internet and the smart

389
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,920
for a penetrating father to the third

390
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,570
world country in the developing world

391
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,850
you will be called on if you haven't

392
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,370
already to give advice on privacy and to

393
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,590
build effective legislation I want to

394
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,300
assure that some government will ask you

395
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,770
to help them to get away with breaking

396
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,680
privacy in some places please be mindful

397
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,280
about it your work and your advice will

398
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,470
have consequences sometimes deadly one

399
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,560
and your work will influence the work

400
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,240
that we are doing and other human

401
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,810
activists in these countries I'm going

402
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,860
to leave you with the question before

403
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,179
i'm finishing the first one is

404
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,919
in this increased environment of

405
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,110
surveillance how human rights activists

406
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,700
can continue to operate in a safe way

407
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,200
how big organization or small

408
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,759
organization trying to bring about a

409
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,100
change in their own community can

410
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,299
operate when big brother is watching

411
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,679
thank you very much for having me
