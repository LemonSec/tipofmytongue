00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:30,029
Dara Murphy well good morning that's a

7
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,660
grater to grate em introduction thank

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,340
you very much and I'd like to thank dia

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,879
a PP for having me here this morning and

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,070
it's funny you know these things that we

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,570
put up there seems to be one agreement

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,980
whether you want to call it the right to

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,690
be forgotten or whatever else whatever

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,550
politicians say can ever be forgotten

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,320
we're definitely in the in the group

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,660
with it where there's agreement and I've

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,760
delighted to be here at this at this

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,730
very important event and to thank as i

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,340
said the AAP p for that for the the

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,289
invitation and I suppose I just wanted

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,320
to talk to you briefly both about

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,188
developments in our own country in

23
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,220
Ireland the European Union a data

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,670
protection regulation generally and I

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,670
suppose our own new data analytics enter

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,840
and our Magna Carta for data my own

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,320
appointment about seven months ago now

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,549
was as the first it was correctly said

29
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,840
European Union country to specifically

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,530
allocate a minister Minister of State

31
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,210
with responsibility for data protection

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,759
i'm also the minister for european

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,009
affairs which which has a obviously a

34
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,720
significant role in european union

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,930
politics and the department is located

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,220
co-located i suppose in our department

37
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,430
of justice from the crime element from

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,140
the policy element in the department of

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,030
the t check which is our prime

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,100
minister's office ireland is very fully

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,020
aware of course of the importance of the

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,909
the space we're moving into the

43
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,969
importance of data protection we have in

44
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,570
our country 29 of the top 30 digital

45
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,598
companies in the world nine of the top

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,239
10 born on the internet companies in

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,040
fact many of them have their

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,349
European headquarters in Ireland

49
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,810
currently so one of the key priorities

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,400
that we set when we had or reshuffle a

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,239
number of months ago was too I suppose

52
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,370
considerably up the role and the

53
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,209
importance of data protection within

54
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,120
within government so we have doubled for

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,810
example or expenditure in our data

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,430
protection office with open the second

57
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,310
office in Dublin and significant

58
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,019
significant significant ly increased the

59
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,510
number of staffing so as you will be

60
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,109
aware by the end of this year it is

61
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,879
estimated that there will be almost five

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,510
billion connected things in circulation

63
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,689
which will rise to 25 billion over the

64
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,180
next four years the Internet of Things

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,389
of course is here and it's growing very

66
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:16,530
very quickly against this measure I

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,769
suppose we finally in Europe have moved

68
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,000
towards moving with more energy and more

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,799
speed with respect to the data

70
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,709
protection regulation I'll come to that

71
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,440
in a minute domestically and I suppose

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,870
every country is is dealing with this

73
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,150
issue in a different fashion we have put

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,389
in place and enter a departmental group

75
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,190
are to look at data protection will be

76
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,220
aware at the moment even in the European

77
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,459
Commission there are three commissioners

78
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,109
all of whom have some role in the

79
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,440
digital or in the data space

80
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,260
Commissioner anceps Irving ER and and

81
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,260
yer over so we're trying a supposed to

82
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,239
give a single point of contact for our

83
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,949
departments whether it is in the Justice

84
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,900
element whether it is in how our

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,989
departments exchange data and of course

86
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:08,639
some of our large data holding

87
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,199
departments like you would have here and

88
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,970
everywhere else in Europe our

89
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,720
departments of health education and

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,810
social protection the theory is I

91
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,519
supposed to have a shared and common

92
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,830
practice across all of our our

93
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,200
departments and allow I supposed to

94
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,780
deliver

95
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,630
effective public policy through the

96
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,420
benefits that can be accrued from data

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,060
management data analytics and indeed

98
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,940
data sharing and I suppose the objective

99
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,419
is to try and find the correct balance

100
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,490
between the potential areas and sharing

101
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,560
data and the vital importance in

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,610
protecting our citizens rights through

103
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,110
through through through privacy so we

104
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,540
have also established a date of forum

105
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,360
which brings together data privacy

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,290
activists industry key academics both

107
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,650
from the legal and indeed from the

108
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,950
technical area and the I suppose the

109
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,500
parallel ambition is that we will

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,930
continue to grow within the analytic in

111
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,570
the data analytic space at a continue to

112
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,850
grow our country as a hub for

113
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,419
technological investment and and all

114
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,190
that comes from that from job creation

115
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,790
and research and development just

116
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,380
briefly and mindys going to keep me

117
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,790
honest on the time because we're going

118
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,500
to have a little Q&A and I'm always kind

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,970
of worried when you're the last speaker

120
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,130
in a session because I can sense the

121
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,080
ambition for coffee and all the rest of

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,620
it but and since my appointment I

123
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,610
suppose the pace of the European Union

124
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,010
data protection regulation has picked up

125
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,440
speed now I'm talking about speed of the

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,840
European Union level of speed which is

127
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,340
different perhaps from the level of

128
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,310
speed the rest of us would would

129
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,070
envisage since our presidency it has

130
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,820
been it has been a very key area and we

131
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,550
are very very strong supporters in

132
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,890
Ireland and in fact I should say that

133
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,570
the Irish position the United Kingdom

134
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,060
position the Dutch position and another

135
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,760
number of European countries is indeed

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,680
very very similar there's there's almost

137
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,330
no difference in fact between the Irish

138
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,280
of you and most elements of the data

139
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,890
protected protection regulation and the

140
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,300
view that there would be here in the UK

141
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,460
we all are aware that given the

142
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,430
remarkable speed and pace of technical

143
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,680
change that the fact that Europe is

144
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,220
operating under 1995 laws it is to be

145
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,920
frank ridiculous

146
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,370
eight years before em before companies

147
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,260
like Google or Facebook even later

148
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,910
appeared so the rules the laws the

149
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,700
direct if we have is not for fit for

150
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,940
purpose and we consistently hear our

151
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,730
commissioners in particular are talking

152
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,280
about Europe needs to be placed to take

153
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
advantage of technological developments

154
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,810
and we must of course do this while

155
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,400
ensuring that we put the rights of the

156
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,040
citizen at the heart of everything that

157
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,350
we do so therefore it's vital that the

158
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,600
new rules we put in place are working

159
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,520
workable and that they do not increase

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,290
ideally they should reduce the levels of

161
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,290
administrative burden and provide

162
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,450
consistent applications of the rules and

163
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,280
that we create the right environment to

164
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,120
create jobs and growth while also

165
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,940
protecting civil rights digital rights

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,110
and data protection and privacy we have

167
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,660
been strong supporters of the principle

168
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,880
of the one-stop shop and from the outset

169
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,730
of negotiations we have made that very

170
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,550
clear this new system will make it

171
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,710
easier for European Union citizens when

172
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,630
it comes to enforcing their rights

173
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,600
across or 28 member states as you know

174
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,010
under the regulation is currently

175
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,220
proposed any EU citizen will now be able

176
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,720
to go to their National Data Protection

177
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,460
Authority for complaints covering

178
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,950
breaches anywhere in the european union

179
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,110
and the one-stop shop if it is

180
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,210
implemented correctly I will also be a

181
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,120
huge benefit for companies it will allow

182
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,430
a company that has a presence in more

183
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,040
than one member of state have a single

184
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,710
regulatory point of contact this is

185
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,860
vital if we believe in any sense in the

186
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,080
digital single market and having the

187
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,600
capacity for businesses to function here

188
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,470
in an efficient matter this new citizen

189
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,010
most crucially protect protect against

190
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,200
delays and additional costs for both

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,630
citizen and businesses and I think at

192
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,510
this time it is vital that Europe does

193
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,430
not send the wrong message as to how we

194
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,130
conduct and do our business now we have

195
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,110
seen significant progress

196
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,070
but there is very very much more than

197
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,450
sorry the much more work that needs to

198
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,329
be done before June's crucial meeting in

199
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,000
Luxembourg when the Latvian presidency

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,110
hopes to see negotiations are concluded

201
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,399
but there are a significant number of

202
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,550
areas which will have to be discussed

203
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,470
the right to be forgotten and i know

204
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,600
very self-conscious about using the term

205
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,390
the right to be forgotten and of course

206
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,420
profile as well or both areas complex

207
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,910
areas and they raised the question of

208
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,670
course between the balancing of rights

209
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,029
in relation to profiling we support the

210
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,279
current proposals but we need we need to

211
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,529
ensure that we don't stifle the

212
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,130
potential for innovation our preference

213
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,000
is for improved transparency and a

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,620
prohibition on discrimination to be

215
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,250
included within within the regulation

216
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,230
can I just say it's fascinating when we

217
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,870
talk about you know the rights the

218
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,279
freedom of expression we have

219
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,190
significant engagement at ministerial

220
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,760
level with the 27 or the Member States

221
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,110
and indeed quite a significant

222
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,000
interaction as well of course with

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
politicians from the United States of

224
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,860
America and what is striking is the

225
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,070
cultural difference and differences that

226
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,470
we have as a group of people on either

227
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,810
side of the Atlantic when it comes to

228
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,130
this competition and balancing of Rights

229
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,990
certainly in the UK in Ireland and and

230
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,449
even more so in the United States the

231
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,510
ambition to have strong laws around

232
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,519
freedom of expression freedom of the

233
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,449
press are very much to the forefront as

234
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,940
you move across into the European Union

235
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,949
and there are many cultural reasons for

236
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,579
this privacy law becomes a much more a

237
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:42,240
much stronger motivator from the

238
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,589
political systems and from the

239
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,540
government systems and I think we need

240
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,880
to understand the dynamic and we need to

241
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,829
see exactly where our partner companies

242
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,920
countries rather are coming from in this

243
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,019
space have to try and understand their

244
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,000
histories which are different I think

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,069
from the histories that we have perhaps

246
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:01,710
as you push across further west and

247
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,370
explain and to current encourage energy

248
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,940
indeed where we're required of course to

249
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,660
be willing to compromise to compromise

250
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,220
with regard to fines we support in

251
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,100
Ireland finds that are fair and that are

252
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,920
proportionate but we do need to avoid

253
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,460
having exemplary fines and again we need

254
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,620
the regulation to be clear so that

255
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,490
people know exactly what is proposed and

256
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,890
what is likely to be the case as they go

257
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,650
through a process we very strongly

258
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,180
support of course the principle of

259
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,370
privacy by design which will ensure that

260
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,200
data protection safeguards will be built

261
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,270
into products and services from the

262
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,180
earliest stage of development and here

263
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,190
again I think particularly in many

264
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,930
government departments in many states in

265
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,900
Europe data protection privacy has come

266
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,620
at the end of various processes and laws

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,710
and rules and regulations and we need to

268
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,200
see everybody whether it is involved in

269
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,330
business or in the state having the

270
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,670
issue of data privacy at the beginning

271
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,160
of the process so that it's designed

272
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,590
into the very architecture or whatever

273
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,790
new regulation is coming down the road

274
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,950
savings for business again the numbers

275
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,800
you hear sometimes are astronomical

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,360
there naturally very vague it's a bit

277
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,490
like the potential money that can be

278
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,040
accrued through T tip but some of the

279
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,610
figures are greater than a saving of in

280
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,110
the region of two to two-and-a-half

281
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,780
billion euro a year which even a

282
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,120
proportion of that of course is a huge

283
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,770
amount of money particularly in the

284
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,990
context of a continent that has been

285
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,840
starved of growth over the last at

286
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,820
number of years if I could just briefly

287
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,640
turn am i okay on time indium hanging us

288
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,650
together good I wish to turn your

289
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,440
attention to the very important area of

290
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,000
data analytics and indeed digital growth

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,510
in itself the reality for Europe and I

292
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,240
mentioned that we've 29 of the top 30

293
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,800
digital companies in the world and

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
Ireland there there are very many of

295
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,610
them of course based here in the UK as

296
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,620
well in other parts of Europe virtually

297
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,209
none of them however European

298
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,209
they are all American companies so we

299
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,730
have got to shift the balance back

300
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,069
towards this continent and the potential

301
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,499
that for the next generation at least

302
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,809
that some of these new companies and

303
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:32,040
businesses will be European ideally they

304
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,110
will be Irish but we can concede across

305
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,559
the Irish Sea a little bit to the UK as

306
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,769
well this growth will not come from

307
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:43,679
European protectionism large American

308
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,100
companies are not bad companies they

309
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,699
will not be I suppose surpassed or

310
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,730
emulated through protectionism they will

311
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,470
be emulated through innovation and

312
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,990
through competition and crucially I

313
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,540
think through research and development

314
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,959
spending here in Europe to that end we

315
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,809
have the largest single ever investment

316
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:09,990
in Ireland is in our insight our data

317
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,389
analytic new new company it brings

318
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,579
together four of our universities and

319
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,220
about 30 of the businesses 30 companies

320
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,759
as well we've spent 85 million euro on

321
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,699
on inside its proud to say it's now one

322
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,369
of the largest data analytic centers and

323
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,670
analytic hubs in Europe and last January

324
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,799
I had the pleasure of speaking in

325
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,929
Brussels of the launch of insights white

326
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,549
paper which is called building a

327
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,499
foundation of trust in big data and

328
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,889
Magna Carta for data so they're very

329
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,290
very ambitious indeed and it addresses I

330
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,480
suppose the need for businesses for

331
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,970
governments to approach big data and

332
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,629
data analytics from a consumer trust

333
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,519
perspective in the very first in the

334
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,839
very first instance so for Ireland for

335
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,699
Europe and to realize the full potential

336
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,089
of the 508 million people who share this

337
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,129
this great part of the world we're all

338
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:10,949
very fortunate to live in we need to

339
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:12,569
ensure the citizens have a very high

340
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,790
level of trust and confidence in our

341
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,910
digital environment so therefore I'd no

342
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,339
doubt that Magna Carta and other and

343
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,259
other such bodies across Europe will be

344
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,399
a huge benefit to the citizens that live

345
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,230
here in Europe so

346
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,080
in conclusion we are living in a work in

347
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,670
a world that sees the enormous potential

348
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,610
that technology brings to us and we have

349
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,770
to in all our discussions about data

350
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,410
protection and privacy also be aware

351
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,170
that there are people who are benefiting

352
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,330
whether it is in the health sector

353
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,590
whether it is in the education sector

354
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,840
and so many other walks of life from the

355
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,180
Magnificent freedoms from the

356
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,990
magnificent advances that has come from

357
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,210
digital and technical advances and as

358
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,700
I've said on a number of occasions it's

359
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,370
crucial that we work very hard to get

360
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,800
the balance right and that balance can

361
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,170
be achieved and in particular it is

362
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,020
vital that industry professionals

363
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,200
leaders like all of you give trying to

364
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,630
come to events such as this listen to

365
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,410
your peers I suppose take on board there

366
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,090
are considerations and their objections

367
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,730
it's very rare i have to say even in

368
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,350
some of the discussions with countries

369
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,270
who we are almost diametrically opposed

370
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,000
to or ideologically opposed to that

371
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,190
people come in bad faith that they don't

372
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,800
have a reasonable point to make and i

373
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,930
think certainly you know while in

374
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,880
certain elements of the data protection

375
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,680
regulation particularly the area of

376
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,410
appeal we have concerns in ireland if

377
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,150
concerns here in the UK and a number of

378
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,310
other countries i think through this

379
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,610
laborious sometimes process of consensus

380
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,130
which people can be critical of within

381
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,320
the European Union the reality is is

382
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,300
when you walk out the door of one of

383
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,359
these European processes at the end of a

384
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,450
regulation you still have 28 member

385
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,490
states signed up to something and that

386
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,369
in itself is very very powerful so I'd

387
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,250
like to thank the ia PP for I will take

388
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,599
questions for inviting me along today

389
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,810
and Mindy has her microphone and I'm

390
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,940
more than happy yes to take questions so

391
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,200
thank you very much for listening to me

392
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,920
this morning grow market

393
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,049
thank you very much it was a very

394
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:40,200
interesting speech i receive rumors from

395
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,419
results that the concept of Protandim

396
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,580
ization will not be any longer really

397
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
supported by the council could you

398
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,659
please share some insight with us about

399
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:54,000
this well you won't be the first person

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,830
who's heard a rumor from Europe I I

401
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,860
didn't see where you are actually when I

402
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,820
was getting the the water yeah I mean

403
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,940
there has to be huge potential in Sudan

404
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,559
I arrived a problem with the pseudonym

405
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,820
ization anything really that can allow

406
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,779
the potential benefit to be derived from

407
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,210
data that allows anonymity for people to

408
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,159
be protected there has to be huge

409
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,139
potential within that there is of course

410
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:25,289
a fear given the re convertibility back

411
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,840
that's implicit that you're actually

412
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,419
defeating the purpose of the pseudonym

413
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,110
and you know in the first place and that

414
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,440
data should be anonymised completely but

415
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,779
look these proposals are being discussed

416
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,590
as we speak I think in that particular

417
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,419
case we're very much in the area of if

418
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,659
we go too far we will be completely

419
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,419
stifling this part of the the planet

420
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,759
with respect to research development and

421
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,960
certainly for my point of view in our

422
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,009
point of view I I would be concerned if

423
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,350
there were to be any any sort of further

424
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,570
dilution in the in the proposals that we

425
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,509
think at the moment are quite balanced

426
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,940
but what you often I always wonder

427
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,139
should they say these things in public

428
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,320
forums I was wonder about that some of

429
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,820
the rumors that come out there they're

430
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,250
out I suppose to test the water Mike

431
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,490
Revis uses this quite often this idea of

432
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,110
such a rumor but if you talk about

433
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,929
privacy by design and if we take privacy

434
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,299
by design very seriously so employed

435
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,610
randomization or if you like so

436
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,220
term coding for example is a very

437
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,650
important and crucial parts there and

438
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,390
it's also understood on the other side

439
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,280
of the Atlantic if you go to he boss

440
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,170
it's a federal laws that protect health

441
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,630
information so limited data set is

442
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,940
they're exactly the same concept and we

443
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,440
should be very careful that you would

444
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
say goodbye to this concept in Europe

445
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,580
because fully in your numerous data I

446
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,920
should talk about age of big data do not

447
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,990
really exist any longer so we need a

448
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,260
concept set support research activities

449
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,170
with the form of a limited data set

450
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,510
where went well it's a term Jordan amuse

451
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,390
a shin is not really the best term well

452
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,320
the term may not be the best term but

453
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,299
but I suppose the principle of allowing

454
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,299
that balance occur whereby but I mean

455
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,370
your point your point is correct I mean

456
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,299
it will it will either function properly

457
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,700
and give full or it won't and that will

458
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,679
be back to the privacy by design element

459
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,110
about the terms and conditions and I

460
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,309
suppose ultimately back to the

461
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,929
confidence that people will have but you

462
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,150
have to remember in most areas and the

463
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,150
area you've picked is it's not is one of

464
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,320
the areas where there probably will have

465
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,910
to be some latitude for medical research

466
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,309
the health area but within privacy

467
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,650
design the explicit consent of users

468
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,830
will be required where the data is

469
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,169
anonymized or not in many areas will be

470
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,809
back to the users decision but we have

471
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,820
to be extremely careful sir because in

472
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,040
the health industry especially the

473
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,620
pharmaceutical research activities we

474
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,590
have the concept of protects identity of

475
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,100
the study participants since 1947 and if

476
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,620
you would now try to destroy it with the

477
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,390
data protection regulations that would

478
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,280
be really a shame and that is why we

479
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,110
have to be extremely careful with what

480
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,540
we are doing there I agree with you i I

481
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,340
don't I can't see the reason in the

482
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,260
pharmaceutical industry why it would

483
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,260
have to be the pseudonym for would have

484
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,400
to be used though I think in that

485
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,160
instance should be anonymised yeah but

486
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,780
for safety reasons it's not possible

487
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,419
because the reason why you use coded a

488
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,400
tour is since the pharmaceutical

489
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,440
industry do not know the identity of the

490
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,660
patient aside the physician knows our

491
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,490
identity and if you have a serious

492
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,380
adverse event what unfortunately happen

493
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,809
from time to time you have to be able to

494
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:52,470
immediately

495
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,750
re identifies a study participant and

496
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,820
therefore you need a code if you would

497
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,919
have fully a new numis data you could

498
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,140
not any longer identify the patient for

499
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,080
safety reasons we needs us if they avoid

500
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,110
you need it but but but you're back into

501
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,330
the data retention space here now about

502
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,799
what periods and what time and what

503
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,250
stages of the the specific m data is

504
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,429
that I mean it is unlikely to be one one

505
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,820
specific set of 41 industry but once

506
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,710
again it's not a requirement of so

507
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,720
pharmaceutical industry to have the data

508
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,789
coated see it's a requirement from the

509
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:29,190
patient because if they have a problem

510
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,549
is they're held so would like to be

511
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,580
secured and if you cannot do this and

512
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,740
with fully an inverse data you cannot do

513
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,510
this therefore we have to be extremely

514
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,880
careful what we are doing there so that

515
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,460
is why the European Parliament

516
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,289
introduced a concept of ploy demise data

517
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,720
and to be honest the council so far did

518
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,539
an extremely good job to even implement

519
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,659
a form of a concept of framework by code

520
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,820
of conducts or so if this would not be

521
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,890
any longer supported on this side of the

522
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,570
Atlantic sand I see a big risk

523
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,799
especially for the pharmaceutical

524
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,110
industry because on the other side of

525
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,970
the Atlantic we do at the moment exactly

526
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,400
the opposite that's right as I say I

527
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
mean it i think it's going too far to

528
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,539
say it's not going to be supported on

529
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,640
the side of the Atlantic though it but

530
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,400
it is a matter for am as you can see

531
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,750
fairly detailed discussion any other

532
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,990
questions I I'd like to bring us back to

533
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,940
article 7 and the right to be forgotten

534
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,880
and to erasure and which you just

535
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,070
touched on because I'm interested in and

536
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,130
what you think the tone in Brussels is

537
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,140
around this bearing in mind the cultural

538
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,020
differences that you highlighted and and

539
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,470
I also feel very respectful of in Europe

540
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,960
is but is their appreciation around

541
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,000
article 7 to the rights of individuals

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,690
to have access to good journalism and

543
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,840
free journalism as well as the rights of

544
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,320
individuals to to be forgotten if that's

545
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
even possible I mean I dislike

546
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,390
phrase as well because it seems such a

547
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,690
simple provision but as we know article

548
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,970
80 is being watered down a little bit

549
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,340
and this simple provision that had its

550
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,430
roots around perhaps protecting

551
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,600
teenagers who didn't like their social

552
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,660
media pictures has much more

553
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,560
far-reaching impacts as we're seeing at

554
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,960
the moment it's almost like a political

555
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,590
tool in many ways and yet I I'm not sure

556
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,800
I don't know what you know what's being

557
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,020
spoken about in the rooms in Brussels

558
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,310
and it'd be really interesting to hear

559
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,250
your your view on this well it's it's

560
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,010
firstly to describe it as a view from

561
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,870
Europe would would be that there are

562
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,860
many different views from you know from

563
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,370
from all sides I mean it strikes me it

564
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,170
has always struck me that you know what

565
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,210
we had was a European European Court of

566
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,850
Justice ruling that just pulled the

567
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,740
first piece of the thread and as you

568
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,960
pull it more the whole garment is has

569
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,720
you know sort to come away and now it's

570
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,210
been it's being stitched back together I

571
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,600
mean as as I say that there's real

572
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,750
clarity and acceptance that when you're

573
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,730
talking about you know postings by

574
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,850
underage young people who may have made

575
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,010
a mistake you know or whatever else and

576
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,250
and there's real clarity about I suppose

577
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,860
directing very large multinational

578
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,600
search engines as well and the resources

579
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,180
they have and I do feel there is there

580
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,950
is yes there is there is a political

581
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,230
element to this in some quarters I think

582
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,390
to be blunt to think there's an active

583
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,010
American element to what I think there's

584
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,520
as I said there's sometimes a simmering

585
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,620
protectionism and then there's a more

586
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,340
understandable ambition ambition in fact

587
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,470
that there would be greater I suppose

588
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,360
competition within the market and indeed

589
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,980
that Europe would play apart within that

590
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,810
competition so the third part is more

591
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,290
understandable a more reasonable than

592
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,350
the first two parts and you know and

593
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,620
then you move to the other side rather

594
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,540
flippantly mentioned politician to their

595
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,170
a good example journalists

596
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,420
I suppose would be in another category

597
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,790
whereby you know it is vital for

598
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,000
democracy in Europe that the concept of

599
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,090
freedom of expression you know freedom

600
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,970
of association that that is protected

601
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,430
and it suppose we have a job in certain

602
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,950
countries to to make the point that ok

603
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,810
privacy rights were very very much

604
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,490
hindered during a period in Europe's

605
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,860
history but so were other rights such as

606
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,220
freedom of expression and and you know

607
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,980
both rights were actually removed and to

608
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,050
try and I suppose focus not on the the

609
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,330
big names and the many billions of

610
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,490
dollars that they take out of Europe but

611
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,060
but rather the underlying rights that

612
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,130
they support because you know these

613
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,280
companies are making advertising money

614
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,180
because hundreds of millions of

615
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,460
Europeans use the many many times a day

616
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
that's a choice a free choice that's

617
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,950
made by all of us so I suppose the sense

618
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,950
that the sense i think that i'm getting

619
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,330
is that there is a sort of a gradual

620
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,170
acceptance dash that we do need to move

621
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,140
to you know to to a greater balance and

622
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,070
that that the concept of the right to be

623
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,060
forgotten and as you say i mean you know

624
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,220
it was never a sort of a term that was

625
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,580
meant to define a European policy but

626
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,280
that we also have to have to enshrine

627
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,870
within within the data protection

628
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,540
regulation in fact all of the rights

629
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,910
that's that that there is better balance

630
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,970
and I think I think we have done quite a

631
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,450
good job particularly if I may say from

632
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,770
Ireland and the United Kingdom in a

633
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,090
number of other countries and actually

634
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,970
making this point reasonably but it

635
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,050
needs to be made because it's not just

636
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,940
such just important for people in

637
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,700
britain or ireland it is just as

638
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,710
important for people in Poland drop

639
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,720
wherever else they may be now Poland's a

640
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,000
bad example actually cuz the poles the

641
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,350
Polish government actually supports the

642
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,180
position we have here in ireland united

643
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,610
kingdom's well but i mean in the east

644
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,479
generally

645
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,639
give a quick question I can take a quick

646
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:36,839
question these are always dangerous too

647
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,159
quick question super quick what can the

648
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,529
Irish government do about the fact that

649
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,679
the competence of the Irish Data

650
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,789
Protection Commissioner seems to be

651
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:53,219
unfairly challenged by other data

652
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:56,419
protection authorities in Europe well

653
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:59,369
they're not unfairly challenged we have

654
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,499
a very strong tradition of independent

655
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:04,909
courts Director of Public Prosecutions

656
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,710
we will be under the new regulation bone

657
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,479
by the exact same laws as they will in

658
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,639
every other member state and anyone who

659
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:14,039
feels a judgment of the Irish DPC is is

660
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,570
there only us in any way we'll have a

661
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,639
course to the courts we have doubled

662
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,399
resources we've opened a new office and

663
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,440
I think we will show beyond any doubt
