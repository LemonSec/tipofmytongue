I've been doing privacy almost as long

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,329
as privacy has been around great so as

93
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,410
you can see we have a lot of depth and

94
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,660
experience on the panel welcome Marcus

95
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,459
and with that let's move to the program

96
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,660
itself and Allah for that I'll turn it

97
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,630
over to Chris Chris floors yours thanks

98
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,260
Dave so to kick that off just from an

99
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,880
agenda perspective we've done the intro

100
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,030
I'll give a quick little overview on

101
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,690
highlighting some of the research that

102
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,030
trustee has done on the GDP are and kind

103
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,099
of awareness what companies are doing in

104
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,290
a broad-based level would swim it over

105
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,120
to Caroline for her to give an example

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,340
of what they're doing Clara time you get

107
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,290
a perspective from an EU company when i

108
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,430
go back to marcus for the u.s.

109
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,760
perspective Q&A at the end feel free as

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
some of you already doing to lodge any

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,380
questions you have in that QA window

112
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,728
david said will be assembling those and

113
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,529
i'll be taking the three of us through

114
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,260
any of those that come up so make

115
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,669
certain you type them in early as they

116
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,420
tend to all flood in as soon as we can

117
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,830
that partner and it's a little harder to

118
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,260
call through them at that point so feel

119
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,480
free to type them in early um as you

120
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,970
jump into kind of an overview obviously

121
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,770
the the GDP are is in its final stages

122
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,320
of negotiation and I'll touch on some

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,840
comments that geove le Giovanni blue

124
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
torelli had given earlier this week we

125
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,890
kind of timing and things like that but

126
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,680
we had done a research study that I

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,930
wanted to share with you I'm to really

128
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,310
try to assess where companies were

129
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,430
generally of course the background on it

130
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,260
just to give you a sense of timing as

131
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,290
we've had a lot of EU related privacy

132
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,240
things going on the survey was carried

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,820
out by third party it was done between

134
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,500
the eighteenth of September and the

135
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,140
sixth of October so keep in mind on the

136
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,610
twenty-third of September's when you

137
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,470
have the preliminary ruling against you

138
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,120
safe harbor and obviously on the sixth

139
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,040
the kind of final version of that from

140
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
the EU court of justice so it was before

141
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,100
that was finalized but certainly EU and

142
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,260
privacy was a big topic during the

143
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,900
survey being in the field it was a

144
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,600
sample of 202 people all people that had

145
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
the ability to kind of prove that the

146
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
new something about privacy so this was

147
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,260
just anyone and they had to be a company

148
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,440
of that hill over 250 employees they

149
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,760
didn't know the trustee was the survey

150
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,310
sponsor and in terms of participation we

151
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,770
had 103 out of the US and 99 out of

152
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,510
Europe with a pretty good mix between

153
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,850
companies and people located in UK

154
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,730
Germany and France so let's take a look

155
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,030
at the results first we asked a general

156
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,160
question around awareness and honestly

157
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,260
of all the points of the survey result

158
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,430
this was the one that was most

159
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,040
surprising to be and that there was

160
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,930
essentially fifty percent awareness of

161
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,090
the Judi PR and this wasn't are you

162
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,900
aware of you know the specifics of x y&z

163
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,250
this was really are you aware of it

164
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,200
generally and what surprised me most

165
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,300
about it was that that awareness was

166
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,650
kind of equally unaware if you will

167
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,880
across the different countries surveyed

168
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,710
with about fifty percent awareness and

169
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,380
the people that responded both across

170
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,440
the u.s. France Germany and in the UK as

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,810
we dug in a little bit to the verticals

172
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,060
that had more or less awareness the

173
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,590
financial services vertical of the

174
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,320
highest awareness at fifty-eight percent

175
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,100
probably not a surprise

176
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,450
given that they're typically very

177
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,860
compliant focus have a lot of different

178
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,660
things that they're worried and

179
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,240
concerned about on that front and maybe

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,130
also not surprisingly the technology

181
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,740
sector had the least awareness at

182
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,050
forty-three percent typically you know

183
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,790
being a bit of a smaller sized company

184
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,070
that may not be as compliant focused but

185
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,450
a bit worrisome given that you know

186
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,010
technology companies are typically the

187
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,830
higher users of data and highest movers

188
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,440
if you will of data we tried to also

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,900
take a perspective and snapshot of big

190
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,900
versus small and kind of maturity of

191
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,660
privacy program and companies that you

192
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,160
know we put in a bucket of more mature

193
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,050
privacy programs and the qualifying

194
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,120
question was you know do you have 10 to

195
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,760
25 or more privacy employees that group

196
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,890
had the highest awareness but even if

197
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,810
you combine all those things you know

198
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,550
for the highest at fifty percent in the

199
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,190
sector the lowest at forty three percent

200
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,000
you know that could have been ninety

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,580
five and five it really shows that this

202
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,410
band of kind of fifty percent awareness

203
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,300
across the board and almost even that in

204
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,470
all sectors it's not that much

205
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,690
variability was really kind of the

206
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,480
driving point to make I'm the survey

207
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,300
results here we move beyond awareness

208
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,540
and said okay you're for those that are

209
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,730
aware so again for the fifty percent

210
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,010
that said they were aware we started to

211
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,570
try and get into questions and all the

212
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,180
rest of these refer to that audience of

213
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,920
what are you doing are you budgeting are

214
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,390
you preparing what are you most worried

215
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,530
about and that will be the next few

216
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,780
slides here of those that were aware

217
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,580
two-thirds said that they were starting

218
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,370
to prepare her even before the law was

219
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,140
finalized and here's where you start to

220
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,940
see a split between the countries some

221
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,560
of the European countries like Germany

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,140
and UK bleeding at 82 and 71 percent in

223
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,900
that preparation with the US and France

224
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,060
at sixty and keep in mind here

225
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,530
especially when we talk about the second

226
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,870
part of this on budget that remember

227
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,460
from the slide before it was a bigger

228
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,030
company generally or most aware so when

229
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,890
we started to ask questions like budgets

230
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,020
this likely skewed away from the smaller

231
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,360
companies that had been only 250 maybe

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,520
500 thousand employees and skewed larger

233
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,700
but 83% had already started to allocate

234
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,270
some budget against the GDP are whether

235
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,710
that be in preparation or actual

236
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,380
implementation over the next few years

237
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,270
and a bit actually surprising to me of

238
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,930
the 21

239
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,310
Senate that they actually already

240
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,230
allocated half a million dollars or more

241
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,089
to address the changes that are required

242
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,750
by this effort over the next few years

243
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,130
so budgets already starting to be

244
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,500
allocated when we started to ask the

245
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,200
question of what are you doing what does

246
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,110
preparing mean I think you got what

247
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,360
would be expected with the GDP are not

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,190
finalized the number of drafts still

249
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,709
being worked you had a lot of responses

250
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,390
that were kind of more in the background

251
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,950
preparation area the first and highest

252
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,110
of which was kind of reviewing IT system

253
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,810
security systems where data is making

254
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,040
certain that you had a good baseline

255
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,600
knowledge of what was happening inside

256
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,089
your enterprise and I won't read all of

257
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,709
these some of the other ones we're going

258
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,800
to be briefed and started to share what

259
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,899
this means with management with the

260
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,850
board of directors you're researching

261
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,470
the changes the second area that we

262
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,000
highlighted here in the twenty-four

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,800
percent bucket it's kind of the one

264
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
question that we specifically had put in

265
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,149
there to ask about implementation they

266
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:52,980
kind of took you the step beyond the

267
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,990
preparation the background information

268
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,529
the educating of teams and that question

269
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,180
really got it are you implementing

270
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,120
changes today to start to to impact

271
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,339
things and get ready even though the GDP

272
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,480
are hadn't been finalized the

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,740
twenty-four percent of people actually

274
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,660
said they were already starting to take

275
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,170
actions today to try and work to address

276
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,560
it when we got into what are the key

277
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,810
concern areas within the regulation and

278
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,250
asking those types of questions not

279
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,950
surprisingly i think the level of fines

280
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,790
and the ability to for dps do fine

281
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,500
companies for non-compliance was the

282
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,380
biggest issue at forty-two percent

283
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,700
tighter consent requirements came in

284
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,070
second at thirty-seven percent and of

285
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,150
course we asked kind of the opposite

286
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,800
question how many of you are concerned

287
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,930
at all about any of these proposed

288
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,550
changes and that was six percent so

289
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,620
either we've got a very slim number of

290
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,390
companies that are incredibly well

291
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,860
prepared and have everything totally

292
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,980
dialed for that group is probably really

293
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,990
in need of additional awareness because

294
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,670
there are quite a number of changes as

295
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,079
we all know in the GDP are when we ask

296
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,910
companies what help is needed what are

297
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,270
you looking to get assistance on I think

298
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,070
the first two were really really not

299
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,710
surprised

300
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,660
I need the second one fifty three

301
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,250
percent more information on what the

302
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,230
changes are understanding what the final

303
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,780
draft is and then the biggest one at

304
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,850
fifty-five percent not alone you I need

305
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,890
to know what's legally in the document i

306
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,450
need to understand you know what does

307
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,670
that implementation what are the faq is

308
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,470
around it what are the things you

309
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,900
typically see soon after any regulation

310
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,490
is passed that starts to give guidance

311
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,880
by DPA etc on what what to really do and

312
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,530
what is expected of you to achieve those

313
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,480
compliance guidelines but the

314
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,610
third-highest one that jumped out was I

315
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,160
think this realization that a lot of

316
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,140
privacy programs are kind of run on you

317
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,780
know Word documents spreadsheets

318
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,210
SharePoint things of that nature and

319
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,760
with something as comprehensive as the

320
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,650
GDP are there was really a need to start

321
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,930
thinking about how do I in order to

322
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,760
scale its across my full enterprise and

323
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,500
make it work on a day-in day-out basis

324
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,960
which is kind of more required by by the

325
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,600
regulation how do i implement technology

326
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,070
to help me meet these compliance

327
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,440
requirements and I've always said you

328
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,640
know coming with my security background

329
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,160
privacy to me is kind of like security

330
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,170
by 15 or 20 years in terms of technology

331
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,120
implementation mething companies were

332
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,620
starting to say and highlight that that

333
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,010
was the types of things that they needed

334
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,560
and last year from for me to raise the

335
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,990
back up a level interestingly almost

336
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,700
three quarters of people said the GDP

337
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,770
are is the most important change in data

338
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,570
privacy legislation in the last 20 years

339
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,300
really at a global level they believe

340
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,010
that the regulation has kind of true

341
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,860
teats with the defining numbers that are

342
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,150
being talked about in terms of

343
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,820
percentage of global turnover and there

344
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,260
was also this belief that the

345
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,060
seventy-seven percent level that it

346
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,270
would actively be enforced by regulators

347
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,010
with the vast majority of people saying

348
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,390
that enforcement would be much stronger

349
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,370
and much more robust than it wasn't

350
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,790
things like the cookie directive they

351
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,200
also believe that they would spend more

352
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,670
on is obviously as it's a much more

353
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,400
comprehensive regulation than the cookie

354
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,390
directive was on last year over fifty

355
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,800
percent of people said they were placing

356
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,150
a high or very high in the corporate

357
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,910
risk register and I think one of the

358
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,340
things that that I see is companies at

359
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,050
least in the US when they do their kind

360
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,690
of government financial filings with the

361
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,210
SEC is a publicly traded company your

362
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:22,510
sir

363
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,550
to see privacy points hit the risk

364
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,260
factors that are shared with investors

365
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,990
and shared with the investment community

366
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,460
and I originally started my career as an

367
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,320
investment banker and we all know that

368
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,210
when things hit that top of the line

369
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,890
list that are shared with investors that

370
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,000
it's really starting to kind of get

371
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
mindshare inside the enterprise so

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,740
hopefully that is a helpful backdrop in

373
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,750
terms of what we're seeing generally I'm

374
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,310
going to turn it over to Caroline now to

375
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,250
get into details and examples of what

376
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,630
you're seeing from companies in the EU

377
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:55,320
Caroline take it away thank you so I

378
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,930
will bring you some information around

379
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,760
what it is that we are doing internally

380
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,370
our configuration seeing on this but I

381
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,950
would also start with a bit of a

382
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,710
background in general because I think

383
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,450
that data privacy in general of course

384
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,170
means an interest interest here and we

385
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,080
can see that from the consumers from

386
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,880
media partners and such and the young

387
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,330
public they are all also in Europe right

388
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,690
now becoming more and more aware of the

389
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,160
privacy issues so the GDP are the safe

390
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,620
harbor all these developments that the

391
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,490
bid's had over the phone now in general

392
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,220
creates very much positive focus on only

393
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,230
suspect so with increased focus of

394
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,230
course and the tension also comes better

395
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,570
understanding and focus for being the

396
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,660
organization so how do you use this then

397
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,710
we use this in order to try to

398
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,620
communicate internally to say that we

399
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,870
need to transform the potential risks

400
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,180
that we see here into a competitive

401
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,490
advantage basically it will be something

402
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,650
that's both positive for us if we can be

403
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,640
prepared and started early in trying to

404
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,090
to Amendola the processes or systems

405
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,590
that will be necessary so even if you

406
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,870
perhaps compel the data protection or

407
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,670
data privacy itself within the

408
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,190
organization sometimes it's easier to

409
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,250
just sell the nice idea of a happy cat

410
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:43,290
tomorrow happy member or or user the

411
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,480
accountability of course is an important

412
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,210
aspect of this it's one of the basic

413
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,040
principles that did CPR brings and we

414
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,780
can actually now then also see and they

415
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,500
indicate text it contains so many things

416
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,840
but one thing is that if it's important

417
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,270
in order to build trust or relationships

418
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,030
with the the consumers and merchants

419
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,470
partners and regulators etc so by

420
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,270
actually being able to demonstrate

421
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,680
accountability and being able to say

422
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,170
already now that we are focused on this

423
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,500
and that we are focused on being

424
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,330
compliant or stay in compliance so

425
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,670
bringing more compliance from a data

426
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,860
privacy perspective means that we can

427
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,160
also then build good and early

428
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,800
relationships with the regulator's this

429
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,870
is something of course that was a bit

430
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,580
different in the various jurisdictions

431
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,300
in Europe we have already today

432
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,520
regulators with a very different

433
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,430
approach in some areas specifically in

434
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,360
in the Nordic areas in the Nordics the

435
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,390
regulators are perhaps not so visible as

436
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,420
for instance in in Germany or in the UK

437
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,910
you're from but nevertheless it's always

438
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:09,910
important we should also keep in mind of

439
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,400
course it also the regulator's right now

440
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,560
are striving in order to learn more to

441
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,750
adapt them to find new ways and reassess

442
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,319
practices etc so it could actually be a

443
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,750
very good thing for for building a good

444
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,170
relationship to try to reach out to the

445
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,470
regulator's already now but it's

446
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,600
important from my perspective within the

447
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,540
organization is that the heat

448
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,520
application is so much more than than

449
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,510
just compliance in our internal dialogue

450
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,980
I found it very important to highlight

451
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,530
that in every

452
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,330
how this is related East you you meet of

453
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,040
course also to take so many other

454
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,160
factors into account and what comes out

455
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,500
in the end is very much a complex

456
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,730
picture of various needs right now we

457
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,170
are making changes to one of the

458
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,910
variables into the ear regulation and I

459
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,800
can see now that's actually then it's a

460
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,010
bit of text missing on the slide but in

461
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,810
the left corner of the picture in the

462
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,640
three doctors should be text playing

463
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,620
local and global legislation so we see

464
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,010
some changes in the regulatory framework

465
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,540
but it does not necessarily mean the

466
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,900
whole picture changes so we have to stay

467
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,930
cool but focus on the important aspects

468
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,460
here and yet again as just mentioned

469
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,410
good previous effective is actually

470
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,600
something that we're starting to become

471
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,290
also a usual casting need a business

472
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,600
need etc so hopefully it will provide

473
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,910
regiments some good arguments that you

474
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,820
can use for highlighting internally that

475
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,510
need to change so where would I start

476
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,100
then um in the yes I would start by

477
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,510
using the existing rushing are there any

478
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,830
gaps today when you talked about the if

479
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,440
we compare the GDP are to the present

480
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
directive still there are so many basic

481
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,230
principles that there are still relevant

482
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,760
for what we need to do with the data how

483
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,190
we are able to process the data how we

484
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,080
can transfer it cetera and for large

485
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,990
organizations then Pamela would say that

486
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,260
the DPO if you have one on board should

487
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,030
already perhaps make an initial

488
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,410
assessment the DPO often this business

489
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,660
best and may have all the tools

490
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,020
available for actually trying to make a

491
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,410
gap analysis of already

492
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,350
what we might be lacking in relation to

493
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,050
the present regime I think that would be

494
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,900
a good start I think also that it's very

495
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,950
important to make friends internally

496
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,720
this is something that we have found

497
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,180
that it's important to be very handsome

498
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,750
to stay visible to build around us and

499
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,060
to try to educate of course about the

500
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,490
upcoming challenges the reason perhaps

501
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,750
see and this goes for everyone both of

502
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,060
the executive level littlest I in

503
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,610
universities with products technicians

504
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,340
in engineering HR and other and other

505
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,570
places for small organizations from the

506
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,340
other hand kept this is a bit more of a

507
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,530
challenge if you don't have already a DP

508
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,530
0 in place but still I would say that

509
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,230
it's important to try to identify the

510
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,830
major issues that you might already have

511
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,880
with regards to the gap already in

512
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,240
relation to the present regime so it

513
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,290
could be an idea of course to return to

514
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,330
the next dollar lawyer Princeton or

515
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,260
other consulting firm but also I would

516
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,560
like to mention specifically the local

517
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,410
DPO organizations like the Swedish data

518
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,530
protection forum that I represent myself

519
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,720
I would say that it's important to try

520
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
to to lace to learn to analyze together

521
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,570
and to to some extent to some extent to

522
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,380
try to find a jointly a way forward in

523
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,870
this the sanctions of course use the

524
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,460
sanctions as an example of why you do

525
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,990
need some extra attention on these

526
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,320
issues management and board should be

527
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,650
aware as privacy issues are right now

528
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,250
moving from something that is a human

529
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,550
right into you but it's also becoming a

530
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,270
corporate risk that needs attention so

531
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,070
if like this to to management hopefully

532
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,340
then you will get you don't already have

533
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,059
a DP

534
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,279
in office you have a good chance of

535
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,980
getting one you need at least a proper

536
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,940
budget so that you are able to actually

537
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,149
try to address these issues going

538
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:35,179
forward if possible I would like to

539
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,730
mention permanent the DPO in place is a

540
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,090
very important factor in this from my

541
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,279
perspective / sickness also that you

542
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,960
would have someone internally actually

543
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,460
owns these issues so going forward we

544
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,340
will perhaps see that there will be at

545
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,340
least partly some organizations for

546
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,019
which it would be mandatory to have a DP

547
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:59,659
always in place but nevertheless still

548
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:01,730
find it important just for ownership

549
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,529
around diseases you what we have been

550
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,879
but where started to focus on already

551
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,570
then in klarna with the next step is

552
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,830
towards in math and analyze of course we

553
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,519
are starting to document and analyze how

554
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,690
how we process data and where we have

555
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,009
perhaps gaps that we need to attend to

556
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:33,559
did a lifecycle management in general if

557
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,149
something of course that is it was

558
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:38,360
important to focus on but from our

559
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,749
perspective we are perhaps putting a bit

560
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:46,580
extra effort into this right now in the

561
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,070
next place we are also focusing on

562
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,419
vendor or supplier management and we are

563
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,759
setting a strategy specifically product

564
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,249
for organizations that heavily depend

565
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:03,200
from suppliers for instance it's of

566
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,330
course important to make sure that you

567
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,940
focus on them from the European

568
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,039
perspective this is sometimes a

569
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,580
challenge when we see a large us

570
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,869
suppliers with a bit of a different

571
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,139
approach to data privacy so they could

572
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,909
need some extra attention like now on

573
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:24,110
the sea GDP are moving on data breach

574
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,830
and th provided by design etc

575
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,440
all these aspects that entails somehow

576
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,870
new technical aspects or new procedures

577
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,330
in place we watch me take some extra

578
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,180
time probably within an organization we

579
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,160
are already starting focusing on this

580
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,530
trademark trying to see what you can do

581
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,530
in order to to put in place more more

582
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,570
clear processes sopia we will be using a

583
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,580
technical tool but anyhow how you choose

584
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,670
to do this or which other possibilities

585
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,830
you might have internally whether it's a

586
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,780
large original company it's still

587
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,960
something but I think it's in post it's

588
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,540
important to start focusing on quickly

589
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,740
because it will take some time clicking

590
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,110
into town for instance ongoing

591
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,520
procurement for new systems it would be

592
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,760
an idiot or webinar think about that the

593
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,100
new or the changed requirements for pro

594
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,650
these systems international transfers of

595
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,410
course it's a specific challenge right

596
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:42,660
now we have the safe harbor that brought

597
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,980
from from a positive view a side effect

598
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,110
that it attracted some attention such as

599
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,590
I suddenly almost every company was

600
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,480
focusing on this issue there was at

601
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,760
least information around international

602
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,960
transfers and the challenges on that the

603
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,560
safe harbor decision but it means also

604
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,430
that companies need to have some kind of

605
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,700
a strategy around both short-term

606
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,510
long-term strategy standard contextual

607
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,490
closest of course being a possibility

608
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,260
right now but how do we use this going

609
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,300
forward we have to map your your

610
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,730
requirements in relation to the

611
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,790
potential changes of course let's see

612
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,030
what you need in terms of transfer for

613
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,300
us specifically for Clara we were lucky

614
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,270
we already had quite a good focus on

615
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,759
this is harbour if you wanna go

616
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,589
we already had established some new ways

617
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:49,929
of being able to transfer in some

618
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:53,679
negotiation we also built a service

619
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,629
specifically to platform so you need to

620
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:02,079
focus on this and see perhaps if there

621
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,879
is something that you might need to

622
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:11,739
attend to before urgently specifically

623
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:15,429
then I would like to mention that hands

624
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,279
on right now to try to bring awareness

625
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,569
and some information on GDP are within

626
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:26,499
the organization is quite important even

627
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:29,739
though the details perhaps might be not

628
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:32,409
that clear even though we might see them

629
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,229
in a week's time still as I can it's

630
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:37,269
important to make sure that everyone in

631
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:39,309
the organization and run really

632
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,289
different things at least know that

633
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:45,279
something is going on it gives us some

634
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,659
assurance about that there will not be

635
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,799
ongoing procurement or ongoing

636
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,239
investments in various platforms etc

637
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:58,779
that we at least don't know about so

638
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,049
that we are able to to be part of the

639
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,629
discussions and to provide some man

640
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:10,209
advice that we are also placing extra

641
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:14,949
focus on data management registered in

642
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:18,099
in Sweden having a DP 0 means because if

643
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,199
we already need to maintain a register

644
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,409
of ongoing data processing activities

645
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:27,159
but we are expanding the scope this is

646
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,079
an important thing strument for us and

647
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,869
it means that we have both or at least

648
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:34,209
the relevant information assembled in

649
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:38,349
one place for many of our are important

650
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:43,539
systems so it makes us a bit it gives us

651
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,049
the possibility of being able to manage

652
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:49,889
challenges in some aspects whether it is

653
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:53,589
around transfers or absorbing or over

654
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:56,099
some other kind

655
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:59,659
it also gives us the possibility to be

656
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:01,190
able to audit my government of course

657
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,980
but also to to place extra attention or

658
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,440
being training principles to specific

659
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,139
teams we are also investing in even more

660
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:16,279
effective annual supply management we

661
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,779
have identified a great number of

662
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:21,830
important service providers and we are

663
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,759
dealing with them then specifically

664
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:29,480
moment trying to place extra space God's

665
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,340
around our corporation we are also

666
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,309
focusing on extra checkpoints we are

667
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:44,509
reinforcing the functional radius for

668
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:48,019
Clara being and a credit market company

669
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,230
it means that we already have purchases

670
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,889
around distant place but this is an

671
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:57,019
important to thrust in order again to be

672
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:00,350
more awareness to the teens and to the

673
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,580
different parts of the organization in

674
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,869
general we are also finding

675
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,220
responsibility throughout the

676
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,919
organization working a lot with our data

677
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,769
protection champion it can network with

678
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,629
ambassadors that we have throughout the

679
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:19,570
organization for for Venice to roll up

680
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,340
and to to be able to say very much

681
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,269
Hansel finally I would just like to

682
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:32,330
mention that two years will go fast so

683
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,850
take this opportunity to benchmark

684
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,119
against the existing directive of motion

685
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,609
do you like something try to find out

686
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,739
what and make sure that you have it in

687
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:48,019
place also to cooperate industry-wide

688
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,999
and regional research I work with the

689
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:53,769
DPO organization also attracted to

690
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,330
cooperate designed finding best

691
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,389
practices and a good way forward and

692
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:04,879
then I would like specifically to say

693
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,309
that actually this is not just scary but

694
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,799
it's actually quite fun this is very

695
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,960
interesting time

696
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,790
they very much is happening in our area

697
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,040
right now it's it's quite exciting don't

698
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,020
forget that and with that I am handing

699
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,270
over to market for the US side of things

700
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,240
thanks Carolyn I think Carol I think

701
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,180
your point is true I think there's more

702
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,020
I've seen more movements and more

703
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,880
happenings in the last several weeks in

704
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,390
privacy than we've seen over some years

705
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,060
so I think everyone you know don't be

706
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,750
daunted by this but also don't don't you

707
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,090
know don't be don't be frozen by it

708
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,710
either Carolyn's list there is pretty

709
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,600
good I'm not you know I mean from a u.s.

710
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,090
perspective if you were to take her

711
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,760
slide there and make a checklist out of

712
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,450
it quite frankly you'd be in good shape

713
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,810
but I think you have to almost roll back

714
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,770
a step my direct experience having been

715
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,350
a consultant for as long as I was and

716
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,050
then if you look at the results of the

717
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,010
survey tells me that US companies even

718
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,480
though we've had the regulation in place

719
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,690
we've had safe harbor in place for years

720
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,570
just like it was with socks and the

721
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,650
other issues US companies tend to do the

722
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,580
bare minimum to meet an obligation and

723
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,560
privacy is one of those areas I think US

724
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,440
companies for the most part obviously if

725
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,300
they're only us focus are going to have

726
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
a very minimal privacy program but even

727
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,000
though ones that have a foothold in

728
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,240
Europe have done the minimum amount to

729
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,270
get ready or to be quote compliant with

730
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,910
either their countries whatever a

731
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,580
country in Europe they operate their law

732
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,560
their implementation of the regulation

733
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,020
or if it was safe harbor to meet the

734
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,450
minimal safe harbor so I think the first

735
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,140
step i would take would be to really do

736
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,930
a self-assessment you know sit down over

737
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,960
your favorite beverage here in the next

738
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,340
day or two whether it's coffee in the

739
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,260
morning or IPA at night

740
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,380
and say what is are you know what is my

741
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,760
team look like what is our team look

742
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,980
like and more importantly what does our

743
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,460
business do where are we operating what

744
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,530
date are we collecting where are we

745
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,870
collecting it how we're using it you

746
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,550
don't have to do a full data map to know

747
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,950
all that you should if you've been with

748
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,290
your company in and doing privacy for

749
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,900
any great length of time and you should

750
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,860
be able to answer some of those

751
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,540
questions and I think that'll help you

752
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,750
assess kind of where to start because I

753
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,460
think what's going to happen here and

754
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,880
keep in mind i have been notoriously and

755
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,570
publicly very bearish on both the

756
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,780
regulation or the gdp are actually

757
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,320
kicking in but i think we've seen

758
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,940
movement the last week or so and even

759
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,330
the statements yesterday that show a

760
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,889
Europe willing to to move and get

761
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,320
something implemented and I think the

762
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,659
safe harbor the schrems decision shows a

763
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,489
willingness to now stop talking about

764
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:28,070
enforcing an increasing privacy but

765
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,870
actually doing something so i think the

766
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,719
times have changed so i think you have

767
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,550
to just have a conversation with your

768
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,440
team with yourself and figure out where

769
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,600
you're at and then the next step is to

770
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,940
obviously make sure that your leadership

771
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,129
wherever privacy is positioned in your

772
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,110
company because privacy sits in various

773
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,820
different places sometimes it's illegal

774
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,250
like it is view Bay sometimes it's in

775
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,199
the business sometimes it's bifurcated

776
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,820
and even try fricative as it is at

777
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,610
Facebook so start having conversations

778
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,040
up your up your leadership chain and let

779
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,570
them know what's coming let them know

780
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,970
some of the key areas you don't to get

781
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,560
into details but give them big picture

782
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,720
ideas and tell them you're working on it

783
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,670
but that there's going to be some

784
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,020
significant changes they're going to

785
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,400
take place I think you start to having

786
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,640
that education now I think the other key

787
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,190
is is if you do operate in Europe and if

788
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,810
you don't have a good relationship with

789
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,110
your primary data protection authority I

790
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,640
would suggest getting one in place

791
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,130
really quickly whether that's your your

792
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,550
European team reaching out whether

793
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,060
that's you

794
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,100
I'm sitting all fly to Europe suddenly

795
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,410
but I think if you if you're not on good

796
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,000
terms and haven't had a good working

797
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,680
relationship with your at least your

798
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,560
primary dpa you need to start having

799
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,210
that because they're going to be key to

800
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,210
your your relationship and your ability

801
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,870
to comply with this new set of regulars

802
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,180
new regulation going forward the DPO

803
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,520
registration i think is an interesting

804
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,290
subject i saw some questions on it about

805
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,740
do we have to have it are we required I

806
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,520
think there's some I think there's

807
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,260
already I think is always some pretty

808
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,270
clear guidance on when you need a DP 0

809
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,130
and if you've gotta know if you're a

810
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,650
major US company without with a with a

811
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,540
European data controller you know you're

812
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,610
in Ireland or you're in the United

813
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,290
Kingdom or you're in Luxembourg like we

814
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,900
are you know you had you pretty clearly

815
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,520
have it to have a requirement to already

816
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,990
have a DP 0 so whether that's your

817
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,520
European Council or your European

818
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,550
privacy head serving as a DP 0 as we do

819
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,830
on our business side or hiring a

820
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,140
consultant to do your DP 0 work as which

821
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,640
is what we do in some jurisdictions for

822
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,040
our employee work because a lot of the

823
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,260
focus is on user data but there's also a

824
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,390
whole probably a whole other webinar we

825
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,160
could have on employee data I think so

826
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,990
with that said I think you know you look

827
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,610
at your staffing once it once you've

828
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,320
done your self-assessment how are you

829
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,180
positioned in Europe do you have one

830
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,450
person five people know people and then

831
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,720
I really think the next step here and

832
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,210
I've seen a couple of questions on data

833
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,010
life cycle management and data mapping

834
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,870
in inventory controls and how do you

835
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,440
start there's various ways to do this

836
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,500
again I think there's some high-level

837
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,290
very basic data mapping that can be done

838
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,820
look at your websites look at all your

839
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,500
collection points those should be fairly

840
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,560
logical try to get an idea of what your

841
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,540
notices save those collection points

842
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,340
because what's going to be key for the

843
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,580
regulation as Carolyn points out is the

844
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,200
ability to document your appropriate

845
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
processing of data and that's going to

846
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,290
be a kind of a hate to use a pun kind of

847
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,000
be a foreign concept for a lot of US

848
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,340
companies that means you're going to

849
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,920
have to be able to show if ass

850
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,569
for all of the personal information

851
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:52,859
you've collected you most likely had a

852
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,290
notice and you gave some indication to

853
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,720
the data subject of the purposes of that

854
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,730
of that club that why you were

855
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,990
collecting and what you're going to do

856
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,780
it how you process it and your data

857
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,809
mapping however you do it automated

858
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:09,420
through tools like people like trustee

859
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,750
have or some other people or manual or a

860
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,660
combination of both essentially what you

861
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,980
want your data map or your data

862
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,650
inventory to show is what data was

863
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,220
collected and what were the purposes

864
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,460
that it was collected under and how is

865
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,260
it being used in the organization where

866
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,599
is it being stored who has access to it

867
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,510
how is it classified how long are you

868
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,849
retaining it so I think there's some

869
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:38,400
really some five or six basic questions

870
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,970
around a lifecycle collection use

871
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,440
retention and deletion disclosure and

872
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,030
security that if you have a basic data

873
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,880
map in place or at least an ability to

874
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,190
start one that's going to be I think

875
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,990
ultimately a requirement on an ongoing

876
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,140
basis once the once that the regulation

877
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,420
becomes fully effective but it's also

878
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,950
going to help you now in preparing to

879
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,170
look at some of the other aspects of of

880
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,299
compliance sorry I'm having to click and

881
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:13,470
talk it's not a good so um you know

882
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,440
substantively we you know I think we the

883
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,900
latest draft I've seen in my team my

884
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,359
European team has passed to me is a

885
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,030
November 15th draft I think you need to

886
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,430
get familiar with that draft whether you

887
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,770
do it directly or you get one of your

888
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,780
outside councils to give you a summary

889
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,790
or your European team to give you a

890
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,770
summary but I think you need to get at

891
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,540
least familiar with that draft there's

892
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,010
no guarantee that that's the draft we're

893
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,960
going to see but again based on the

894
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,970
statements yesterday I think we're

895
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,150
pretty close I don't know if we're truly

896
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,319
talking final passage final approval in

897
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,420
the next month I'm not sure how much

898
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,490
more changes to the draft we're going to

899
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,440
see I think some of the big picture

900
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,930
items are there so I think you can start

901
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,300
getting familiar with it now

902
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,840
your gr team again I I put this bullet

903
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,420
in quite frankly before the statements

904
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,420
of yesterday in Silicon Valley this was

905
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,280
to really stay engaging gr team because

906
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,290
of the process I don't know if any of

907
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,210
you have been having your gr team

908
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,460
involved but there has been some ability

909
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,290
i think by industry to affect some of

910
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,790
the provisions i think we're looking at

911
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,430
a draft that was actually written with

912
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,320
some good input from some trade

913
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,180
industries and trade associations and

914
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,030
from from US companies so hopefully that

915
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,120
will continue right until the end and

916
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,850
like i said previously start now having

917
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,020
a conversation with your management

918
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,950
about big picture items stuff that's can

919
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,150
come and if you can start a gap

920
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,550
assessment obviously on the november

921
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,100
version that would be kind of bonus i

922
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,840
will say i think subjective lee one of

923
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,280
the big issues that you're going to have

924
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,510
is knowing what changes you're going to

925
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,730
have to make to your that you can

926
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,040
control implementing a PIAA process

927
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,520
doing a data life cycle management you

928
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,690
know doing the things that are pro

929
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,180
privacy program based that you hopefully

930
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,670
can control through your budget and your

931
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,160
workforce but there's going to be a lot

932
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,810
more that's going to need to change that

933
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,580
the business is going to have to be

934
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,800
aware of and agree to product changes I

935
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,020
think explicit consent for marketing

936
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,200
it's going to be one of those areas most

937
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,420
US companies operate in an opt-out basis

938
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,540
I think between the two changes we're

939
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,420
seeing here with the GDP are as well as

940
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,100
the changes in Castle I don't know if

941
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,620
any of you're aware but come 2017 in

942
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,930
Canada you're going to need pretty much

943
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,810
express consent for commercial

944
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,610
commercial messaging so i think the the

945
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,450
do the the tide has changed and this

946
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,590
concept of opt-out just people

947
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,930
automatically by use of a service or

948
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,990
registration for a service automatically

949
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:59,040
receiving email marketing but being able

950
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,290
to up data i think those times are

951
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,120
coming to an end and so I think you're

952
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,380
going to have that's one of the key

953
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,970
areas i would start having a

954
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,410
conversation with your business because

955
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,170
that's it usually a big pain point

956
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,060
people usually point to that being

957
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,010
depending on your business model but for

958
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,230
come

959
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,750
like eBay being able to market to and

960
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,510
contact and encourage use of the site

961
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,100
that's the whole reason we're in

962
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,580
business so I'm going to wrap up here

963
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,490
I'm getting I'm getting the hook I think

964
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,920
again that checklist from if you look at

965
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,930
my slides mine or more kind of process

966
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,810
what to do sort of phase 1 phase 2 phase

967
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:39,609
3 but really do something I think my

968
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:42,640
last slide here 2018 you know that's

969
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,200
this is really going to depend on when

970
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,550
it kicks in but we're looking most

971
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,980
likely based on the current timeline

972
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,310
early 2018 but that isn't wait till then

973
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,869
to do it there's going to be a phased-in

974
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,359
approach and I will mean by early 2018

975
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,940
you'll have to have everything in place

976
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,430
to meet the the submissive parts of the

977
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,540
regulation so again I would start now I

978
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,700
wouldn't panic but I would definitely

979
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,340
start thinking about privacy on a much

980
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,990
different level than we've thought about

981
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:17,830
it previously Dave back to you I'll jump

982
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,410
in is a got one more page here before I

983
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,030
jump into some of the questions and this

984
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,890
is Chris again thanks Marcus thanks

985
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,680
Caroline for the perspectives I think we

986
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,050
had had an event in san francisco on

987
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:33,310
tuesday where literally had WebEx into

988
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,580
it and shared a bunch of of feedback and

989
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,200
I've included some of the quotes here on

990
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,650
the page on the left here he went off a

991
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,510
little bit and said some things a

992
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,950
highlight that weren't quite in the

993
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,060
exact messaging but I think the key is

994
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,350
first point eat it kind of explicitly

995
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,420
said it was the most strong I've heard

996
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,290
from a European saying you know next

997
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,910
week just in time for Christmas we

998
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,840
expect the parliament and council

999
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,640
tribution of political agreement on the

1000
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,170
GDP arch so that was the strongest

1001
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,570
messaging I heard that this is going to

1002
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:07,240
be in kind of final form as of next week

1003
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,400
and he'd even joked that you know Santa

1004
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,750
Claus was going to come a few days early

1005
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,910
and deliver a gift when you made it

1006
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,000
verbal comments I think that he outlined

1007
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,220
a timeline that had said you know final

1008
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,650
adoption of the regulation will take a

1009
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,810
few more months he was pointing to April

1010
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,650
or May of 2016 with full kind of

1011
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,120
applicability

1012
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,700
enforcement starting two years later he

1013
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,830
was questioned in that session about you

1014
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,170
know we've heard it being pulled up and

1015
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,060
trying to be made 18 months is there any

1016
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,830
possibility for that and he said well

1017
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,380
that's still in discussion he was pretty

1018
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,300
firm in his belief that it was going to

1019
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,480
be kind of two-year window upon which to

1020
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,340
get these things in process because

1021
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,930
there isn't understanding that there's

1022
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,330
quite a number of changes in the current

1023
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,740
versions of the regulation as they come

1024
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,320
together in the last but not least she'd

1025
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,230
certainly I would say and I saw it

1026
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,050
covered by some reporters there he was

1027
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,150
give him pretty stern warning saying you

1028
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,820
know get going now like even reference

1029
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,710
back to saying don't do what happened

1030
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,090
with the you safe harbor where everyone

1031
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,710
waited in that but I came in slate you

1032
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,930
know us companies complained and said

1033
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,180
I'm not ready he said you've got the two

1034
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,290
years use them wisely as the enforcement

1035
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,820
date will be one that won't move there's

1036
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,800
going to be links to that presentation

1037
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,230
that he gave on the trustee site they're

1038
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,550
not up quite yet we're still pulling it

1039
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,440
together but you can look there on the

1040
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,480
next few days for it and then also here

1041
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,070
on the on the right part of this page

1042
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,600
there's a link but you can also just go

1043
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,880
to the general trustee site look under

1044
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,730
business resources and research and you

1045
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,170
can get the full version of the research

1046
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,450
that I was talking from from earlier so

1047
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,640
we have a number of questions let's dive

1048
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,130
right into them first maybe back to

1049
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,960
Marcus and Carolina a bunch of questions

1050
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,030
I'm kind of you know and you've talked a

1051
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,440
little bit about this but I think they

1052
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,940
were even the next level down its

1053
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,710
specificity on you know how do you

1054
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,600
really do these things like do you look

1055
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,000
specifically to external tools of x and

1056
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,550
y and z do you use any technologies to

1057
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,980
do this is a kind of a dhaka methodology

1058
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,750
a lot of questions on the you know

1059
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,120
technology side of you know what do you

1060
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:19,060
use and how do you do it um yes there's

1061
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,700
a mix of course and it depends also very

1062
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,940
much on the size of the company we have

1063
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,210
shoots and basically to work went to

1064
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,520
electronic tools one is the data

1065
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,490
management object that we call it but

1066
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,870
the data management register where we

1067
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,039
assemble lots of information around

1068
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,059
a shape when their legal grounds for for

1069
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,160
the processing of the personal data

1070
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,009
contained in the register various

1071
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:53,729
assessments that have been made if there

1072
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:56,309
is perhaps a mild sourcing relevant for

1073
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:00,569
that in a data protection if there is

1074
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:02,609
any agreements in relating in

1075
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:04,739
relationship to that that needs to be

1076
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,839
covered at such as we try to assemble

1077
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,529
cannibal information in one place next

1078
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:13,679
phase we will also start using a system

1079
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,839
of alerts in this so we will include

1080
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,130
this in our in our scheduled plans for

1081
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,099
revision by the global privacy office so

1082
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,359
it means that it will actually start

1083
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:26,519
taking out whenever we see that there

1084
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,569
are there is a need for review

1085
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:32,309
furthermore we are also specifically

1086
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:35,249
implementing an electronic tool for

1087
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:38,789
privacy impact assessment we found that

1088
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,919
to be quite effective and it brings so

1089
00:47:40,919 --> 00:47:42,809
many other aspects to this not in

1090
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:47,189
practice just to be able to administrate

1091
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:50,549
the administer that the pier process but

1092
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:54,019
also again for training for awareness

1093
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:57,059
for simplicity actually also being a

1094
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:00,269
tech company it's easier I've handed to

1095
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:04,109
implement a tool then even if it's

1096
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:08,059
simple word or excel sheet so we have

1097
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,949
pretty much most of the processes around

1098
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:15,869
these two electronic tools I think from

1099
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:18,029
my perspective Chris I think for when

1100
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,169
you're looking you're talking about data

1101
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:20,999
mapping I think you need to partner with

1102
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,809
your info SEC they should already be

1103
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:27,269
worried about what what days of the

1104
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:29,759
company has where it's where it's at how

1105
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:31,609
it's classified and how it's being

1106
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:34,949
protected I mean one can assume that you

1107
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,380
have an infosec that has data

1108
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,419
classification data handling standards I

1109
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:41,069
mean and again from the privacy team

1110
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:43,229
isn't you know while security is an

1111
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:45,539
element of privacy we don't own we don't

1112
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:48,269
own the frontline doing that so my first

1113
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:50,609
my first reaction would be partner with

1114
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:53,290
them are they already utilizing a tool

1115
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,290
process or a consultant and can you

1116
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,200
either leverage that get involved in

1117
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,910
that make that better that's our

1118
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,240
situation at ebay we've the team privacy

1119
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,300
is does own data mapping and we've got

1120
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,700
infosec rafael and doing its own and

1121
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,410
we're trying to pull those two processes

1122
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,540
together because again i think the key

1123
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,200
for the regulation purposes it's why

1124
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,690
people do a data mapping or an inventory

1125
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,420
and it sits on the shelf moonshell the

1126
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,100
infamous shelf where meaning it doesn't

1127
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,020
get updated it's not a living breathing

1128
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,210
document that's not going to do you any

1129
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,390
good I'm having a snapshot in time you

1130
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,980
know just like you know we do it like a

1131
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,140
pci assessment having a snapshot of your

1132
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,340
of your your infrastructure on you know

1133
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,820
january 15 2016 is not going to help you

1134
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,080
it's going to be out of date a day later

1135
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,060
soon as somebody makes a change to a

1136
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,190
system or act as a new collection point

1137
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,080
so it's got to live and breathe again

1138
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,420
whether there's tools out there you know

1139
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,020
obviously GRC tools like Archer or

1140
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,270
Orbison pages or what have you there's

1141
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,060
some off-the-shelf stuff be wary of

1142
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,370
consultants I think it's um there's a

1143
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,230
lot of vapor where a lot people sell you

1144
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,690
on their process and stuff you can

1145
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,090
probably do on your own I think with

1146
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,100
some creativity where's got a bit as i

1147
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,350
reflect the nature of your business and

1148
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,540
the nature of your your data life cycle

1149
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,440
management i think one thing I'd add to

1150
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,820
that kind of stepping out of the

1151
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,920
moderator rule for a second putting on

1152
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,300
my you know trust you supporting

1153
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,740
thousands of customers and thinking

1154
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,660
about this I think a lot of people have

1155
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,400
looked at tools and technologies and in

1156
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,900
the past used like I referenced earlier

1157
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,570
you know things like Word Excel pure

1158
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,820
point etc which I think are great spot

1159
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,170
to get you started when it comes to

1160
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,610
technology we've seen a number of

1161
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,670
companies like said Marcus as part of a

1162
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,220
broader company-wide implementation of

1163
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,050
GRC system kind of use that as a method

1164
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,850
to kind of try to run a compliance

1165
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,640
process around pias but are oftentimes

1166
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,140
challenged in a sentence that the

1167
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,400
privacy content isn't in there to really

1168
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,920
help people get over the hump and I know

1169
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,310
Clara has used some technologies we

1170
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,150
built the

1171
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,980
you can see on our site called privacy

1172
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,200
assessment automation and helping you do

1173
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,660
pias encourage people looking at that to

1174
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,730
take a look and that'll be my my one

1175
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,980
little sales pitch for a great

1176
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,270
technology that we think has helped

1177
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,280
companies as small as 100 hundred and

1178
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,710
fifty since I launched in march of

1179
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,330
earlier this year all the way up to

1180
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,800
companies that have a hundred thousand

1181
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,420
plus employees and helping them related

1182
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,360
through this process and automate it

1183
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,800
jumping around to two other questions

1184
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,930
this one Marcus I might seem a bit more

1185
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,240
at you I know that you have your VCR

1186
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,800
you've had it for quite some time I

1187
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,810
think there was a question around you

1188
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,750
know does the GDP are have kind of

1189
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,730
applicability you make any major changes

1190
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,620
to someone that either has a VCR like

1191
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,480
yourself or more broadly someone that

1192
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,240
may be thinking about a VCR yeah I think

1193
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,240
it's unclear at this point what the

1194
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,280
impact and ocean questions on you know

1195
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,980
as not only a country level adequacy you

1196
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,320
know the EC has a list of countries that

1197
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,940
considers adequate for dead transfers I

1198
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,740
think some about the joke I mean endures

1199
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,050
on there for crying out loud I mean but

1200
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:11,710
I think also on the remaining 23

1201
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,680
adequacy mechanisms you know will you

1202
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,100
have to reset I would assume that any

1203
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,230
discussion of a new safe harbor 2 point

1204
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,870
0 would be if they're smart the

1205
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,850
substance of that program would be

1206
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,700
written around the GTR but I will also

1207
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,340
assume that you know the standard

1208
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,110
contract clauses will themselves be

1209
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,330
modified then that leaves the binding

1210
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,370
corporate rules I mean the binding

1211
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,200
global rules for the most guys aren't

1212
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,080
written in a very tactical way I mean if

1213
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,610
you've read anyone's VCRs they're not

1214
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,950
they're not a privacy policies or

1215
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,020
standard there are there a high-level

1216
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,760
sort of mission statements you know

1217
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,640
privacy Constitution if you will but we

1218
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,160
are I can tell you we are contemplating

1219
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,780
a BCR refresh once the GDP are is

1220
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,670
finalized most likely to look to have a

1221
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,950
revised commitment because that's really

1222
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,930
what a VCR is it's a company's corporate

1223
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,910
commitment to privacy at a corporate

1224
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:14,500
level we're going to revise our bcrs

1225
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,420
give more of a facelift to them

1226
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,030
hopefully timed around the final

1227
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,049
implementation

1228
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:22,269
we haven't been told absolutely we have

1229
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:25,660
to do that bar our primary dppa and the

1230
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,849
two backup jurisdictions but we feel

1231
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:29,499
that something that you should you

1232
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,509
should consider so yeah anyone who's on

1233
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,239
the call I be relatively shocked that

1234
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:36,099
there were many BCR shops on the call

1235
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:38,319
but if there are congratulations and

1236
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,509
yeah i would consider along with one of

1237
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,699
your items maybe not the highest

1238
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,439
priority but one of your items would be

1239
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:46,660
to take a look sensitively at your VCRs

1240
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,729
and say is there anything we're going to

1241
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,670
need to get get a refresh on keeping in

1242
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,019
mind the BCR process is lengthy and

1243
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:58,689
again really relies on your relationship

1244
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:03,189
with your dps everyone I didn't mean to

1245
00:54:03,189 --> 00:54:04,599
exclude you from that question but

1246
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:09,459
anything you'd like to add there um well

1247
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,259
at the moment actually we are also

1248
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:14,739
starting to think about BTW ours I think

1249
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:16,239
it's a good approach in a good way for

1250
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,979
but not just for major company but as

1251
00:54:20,979 --> 00:54:24,099
Marcus also pointed out that that is a

1252
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:28,119
bit further down the road so from our

1253
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:29,709
perspective we are waiting and seeing

1254
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:32,319
but more what it what is happening in

1255
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,479
general and as mentioned before what we

1256
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,339
have picked up both for here and that

1257
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:41,199
might be a specific Nordic issues in

1258
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:43,239
Europe for this effect that also

1259
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:47,349
actually the 30 pas are hesitant right

1260
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:50,799
now so I would wait a little i before

1261
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,839
perhaps approaching them on an issue

1262
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:55,239
like that ah yeah and let me let me let

1263
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,559
me let me read it I think that's what

1264
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,989
best mean I have literally a slide deck

1265
00:54:58,989 --> 00:55:00,640
i'm working on for my general counsel

1266
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,589
and i have just that statement but we're

1267
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:05,380
not be i would not if I had a VCR in

1268
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,509
place or even quite frankly a new VCR

1269
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:10,089
application I would probably hold off

1270
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:12,130
because you're going submitting it now

1271
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,959
is going to just be in your in a clog

1272
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:17,289
anyways and there no DPA is going to act

1273
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:21,160
there's a lot of consensus seeking by

1274
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,679
the GPAs and so I think you know you'd

1275
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:25,630
be a little more repos phul i will say

1276
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,429
let me I know that running low on time

1277
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:30,039
but you know for years I had to defend

1278
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:31,869
the VCRs and whether they were business

1279
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:32,990
limiting and do we

1280
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,300
really need them and in the last month

1281
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,070
and a half God many a congratulatory

1282
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,290
email on how great it was that we had

1283
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,280
the VCR is in place so that's probably

1284
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,140
turned pretty quickly I think you know

1285
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,060
we are one of the other avenues that

1286
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,160
might point out is you know through the

1287
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,810
referential that was announced between

1288
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:55,190
kind of the APEC and VCRs for companies

1289
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,590
that you know could do a PEC type

1290
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,450
certification we've seen one large

1291
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,730
health related company use that as a way

1292
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,130
to be going through the VCR process and

1293
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,060
I think that there is absolutely synergy

1294
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,640
there that we're seeing in terms of

1295
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,980
being able to operationalize kind of one

1296
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,950
effort that gets you a lot of cross

1297
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,560
energy and then would you know once the

1298
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,240
VCRs completed have good

1299
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,920
interoperability of data transfer

1300
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,170
between you know the 49 really kind of

1301
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,760
biggest economies in the world and kind

1302
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,490
of excluding India and that process was

1303
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,290
moving kind of quite quickly and quite

1304
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,020
inexpensively I think relative to other

1305
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,200
VCRs that I've seen clients pursue it

1306
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,000
absolutely got bogged down in the last

1307
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,520
three to six months as all of the safe

1308
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,840
harbor and other things have come along

1309
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,580
so I agree with both of your comments of

1310
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,080
if you're thinking about starting in one

1311
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,970
regard you might be worried about you

1312
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,710
safe harbors long-term sustainability

1313
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,480
don't like model clauses want to get

1314
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,700
started right away but I would reiterate

1315
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,890
with both the others are saying and that

1316
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,570
seems to be a process that has slowed

1317
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,880
considerably given all the other issues

1318
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,580
at hand Marcus you kind of seen one of

1319
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,630
the other questions in here that I

1320
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,480
wanted to pick up clearly a number of

1321
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,030
canadians on the phone so to answer to

1322
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,320
the questions there i think that were

1323
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,180
relevant one is specific to our research

1324
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,430
we did not include canada and the

1325
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,140
research apologies is that offends one

1326
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,440
up there but we didn't do that to that

1327
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,940
specific question but when it comes to

1328
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,040
the broader question or on adequacy with

1329
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,650
us in the context of canada at our

1330
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,800
events last tuesday again we'd ask some

1331
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,270
of the Europeans kind of a specific

1332
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,880
question of do the countries that are

1333
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,830
deemed at equivalence that gdp are

1334
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,540
happens that it kind of grandfathered in

1335
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,550
as they currently are or does that

1336
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:43,160
require you know kind of an update

1337
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,930
across the board and a reassessment of

1338
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,720
each of those adequacy findings and the

1339
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,180
initial read back of the level you know

1340
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,520
not quote the person because they also

1341
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,990
said they need to go back and make

1342
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,490
certain but the initial response was

1343
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,790
that yes equus II would continue under

1344
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,190
the GDP are passing but they were going

1345
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,900
to confirm that so I think you might

1346
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,820
know that the questions been asked see

1347
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,550
further guidance when the GDP are comes

1348
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,410
out or soon thereafter and some of the

1349
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,359
fa cues that I think we all expect them

1350
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:12,340
to be back to be dry I would yeah I

1351
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,619
would think it would be to use a really

1352
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:16,330
big word at nine o'clock good morning I

1353
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,800
think it would be Polly anak to think

1354
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,530
though that countries like Canada or

1355
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,920
Australia that have fairly robust EU

1356
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,710
centric privacy laws in pypy doll or in

1357
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:30,310
the new apts I think it would be I think

1358
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,000
you'll you'll see again maybe not

1359
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,080
instantaneously but I think you'll see

1360
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,720
you know hi Peter perhaps being updated

1361
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,690
to to change to be more in line with

1362
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,890
with the GPR I mean they already are in

1363
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,690
the other 4matic assess the castle is a

1364
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,880
much more burdensome marketing regime so

1365
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,859
then I'll read it already kind of meat

1366
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:52,690
you know they were almost ahead of the

1367
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,790
gdp are in that sense so I think the

1368
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,800
eyes with you mechanisms I mean Europe

1369
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,980
has seen that the turmoil that getting

1370
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,480
rid of safe harbor overnight cause

1371
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,520
they're not going to get rid of these

1372
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,859
adequacy determinations the EC won't

1373
00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:08,020
because it's an EC discussion really

1374
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,960
working with a 29 group not annual

1375
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,660
lateral you know the trams with a

1376
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,180
unilateral you know and then the ecj

1377
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,330
supporting that action so I think the

1378
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,490
adequacy mechanisms are fine I think if

1379
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,099
you bring your program at the speed with

1380
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,930
the GDP are you won't really have to

1381
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,760
worry about in any way good thanks for

1382
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,160
that I know we're here at the top of the

1383
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,839
hour I've got one last question for you

1384
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:36,609
to upload a little bit if you had to

1385
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:39,119
pick kind of in all the things out there

1386
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,310
in the GDP are and there are certainly a

1387
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,839
lot of changes if you had to very

1388
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,000
quickly just pick one on the pro one on

1389
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,560
the slip on the con side what's the

1390
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,540
what's the one that's kind of easy that

1391
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,280
you've got nailed that you don't think

1392
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,260
as much for you know a typical business

1393
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,810
like yours to to worry about because you

1394
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:57,369
would have done it in the past or what

1395
00:59:57,369 --> 00:59:58,930
have you and what's the one that when

1396
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,130
you look at you think is

1397
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,040
and operationally most burdensome just

1398
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,440
in terms of highlighting maybe some

1399
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,570
areas that the companies can you know

1400
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,160
start their focus on if they look and

1401
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:15,280
feel like like you that for me correct i

1402
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,590
think will be easy even if the

1403
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,090
low-hanging fruit for us is obviously

1404
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,280
the DPL work we've already got a robust

1405
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,500
network of DPOs in place based on our

1406
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,090
data controller structures so i'm not

1407
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,250
too concerned about that there wasn't a

1408
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,920
lot of talk of them now you know single

1409
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,340
jurisdiction or you know what let dtas

1410
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,870
are you now going to be going to be

1411
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,510
going to be regulated by is it now your

1412
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,360
your home country or is it every DPA so

1413
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,400
that's concerned the con i think the

1414
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,710
hardest is going to be quite frankly i

1415
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,660
have that debate i'd have to split that

1416
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,010
between an actual real robust data

1417
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,960
control data inventory processes that's

1418
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,060
living breathing and at any point can

1419
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,720
show you know can be a convenience of

1420
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,980
processing authorization and or building

1421
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,400
and implementing a true privacy true

1422
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:13,120
privacy by design program yes and i can

1423
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,860
only echo that because i still also

1424
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,310
think under the present regime privacy

1425
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,920
by design it's it's so very much a

1426
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,940
challenge and perhaps not so much

1427
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,100
actually because of their sexual

1428
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,470
regulation and the upcoming text

1429
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:31,930
potentially but in practice to actually

1430
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:36,010
solve the the challenge in practice to

1431
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:40,120
get from the global privacy or first

1432
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,790
corner to the team the technical teams

1433
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:44,590
in how to actually implement this all

1434
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,010
the way down if anyone has the answer on

1435
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,440
that in practice please give menina

1436
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:56,380
north called and then for for the upside

1437
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,310
i think yes accountability and the

1438
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:02,860
documentation i think it's good it's

1439
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:07,480
very relevant and it's quite we are

1440
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,450
already in practice to some extent there

1441
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,580
and it's quite good actually good

1442
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,160
starting points

1443
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,380
and as I am speaking can I just as a

1444
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:21,160
very last point mentioned that for this

1445
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,320
more as i know in the knowledge there

1446
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,670
are so many challenges too many

1447
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,920
organizations that don't even have DPO

1448
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,240
on board to that don't have a lawyer or

1449
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,100
infotech person or anyone focusing on

1450
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,680
this just start out by actually trying

1451
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,220
to get ownership of that the privacy

1452
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,410
invade the security aspects in general

1453
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,170
and work from there but that's a

1454
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,200
specific Europe and northern Europe is

1455
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,980
your pet Dave I'll turn it back to you

1456
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,510
but certainly try to do the best to get

1457
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,010
through a number of these questions and

1458
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,080
punch them together but certainly on my

1459
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,790
we have if anyone has any additional

1460
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,110
questions that we can be helpful with

1461
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,150
emails on the screen and email away

1462
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:04,360
should you have follow-up questions yes

1463
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,070
thanks very much Chris and I was going

1464
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,660
to echo that as well I'd like to thank

1465
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,100
all of you out there in the virtual

1466
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,570
audience for submitting such great

1467
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,370
questions we got a lot of them and we

1468
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,530
were Chris you did a great job and

1469
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,300
handling a number of them combining them

1470
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,650
but there are still some unanswered so

excellent view on an ever-evolving kind

1478
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,220
of prognostication of what what's about

1479
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,880
to happen I'm sure that books appreciate

1480

Marcus that's a very gracious offer we

1516
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:00,630

1517
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,309
little bit let me just do some finishing

1518

to cover some of these just quickly via

1522
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,160
housekeeping if you are an IUP certified

1523

privacy professional you're wondering

1524
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,970
about cpe credits if you signed up for

1525
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:19,140
the program and you're the named

1526
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,940
registrant those will be granted to you

1527
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,200
automatically there's nothing that you

1528
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,420
need to do you will be that would just

1529
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,710
be credited to you for your upkeep of

1530
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,839
your certification and if you're

1531
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,460
listening in but you didn't sign up you

1532
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,839
weren't the named registrant you're

1533
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:32,220
still eligible for those credits you

1534
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,660
just need to click the live link in

1535
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,450
front of you or go to our website under

1536
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,430
the certification tab and there's a very

1537
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:42,420
easy to fill out form there you can use

1538
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,220
to receive those credits if you're an

1539
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,210
attorney and you're wondering about

1540
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,640
continuing legal education CLE credits

1541
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,579
this program may or may not be eligible

1542
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,240
for those I know that it often is these

1543
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,740
programs often are eligible for those

1544
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,539
credits but you don't pre certify them

1545
01:05:57,539 --> 01:05:59,549
so you will need to contact your

1546
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:01,259
jurisdiction see what they require it

1547
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:02,609
varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction

1548
01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:06,089
and apply and hopefully be able to

1549
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:07,109
receive those credits if you need

1550
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:08,700
supporting materials in your

1551
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,160
jurisdiction for instance copy of the

1552
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,970

1556
01:06:21,029 --> 01:06:22,890
in front of you now feel free to call it

1557
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,680
right we love to hear from you again how

1558
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,180
you enjoyed this program and what you

1559
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,549
might be looking for in the future and

1560
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:31,019
we will be posting a recording of this

1561
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:33,559
program approximately 48 hours from now

1562
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:36,750
there's a link in front of you that will

1563
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,430
take you to the trustee website where

1564
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,510
you will be able to

1565
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:43,440
load a copy of the report I believe the

1566
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,240
size as well and a copy of this

1567
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,850
recording if you missed it or wanted to

1568
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,300
go back to review any of the information

1569
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,860
so that's all the housekeeping that I

1570
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,130
have and with that let's see Marcus is

1571
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,300
there anything in particular that you

1572
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,220
noticed in the question list here that

1573
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,660
we didn't get to know you wanted to

1574
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,270
tackle ah there was some discussions

1575
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,670
that I incorrectly stated Castle yes I

1576
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,800
know that the express consent mechanism

1577
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,900
is actually required now but the teeth

1578
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,180
when you're dealing with businesses that

1579
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,100
rely on marketing until you tell them

1580
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,780
there's an enforcement risk you're

1581
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,010
you're not going to get people to move

1582
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,980
so the 2017 mark is really what most

1583
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,570
companies are pushing towards in terms

1584
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:24,870
of implementation yeah if you can get

1585
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,250
your business to implement an express

1586
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,410
consent mechanism now for new users

1587
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,960
moving forward or to refresh current

1588
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,180
users that's a great idea it's just that

1589
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,260
most businesses are going to want to

1590
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,270
push back in here what the risks are so

1591
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,400
that's around castle there was questions

1592
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,680
about my statement about DPOs yeah it's

1593
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,470
unclear again when i say operations in

1594
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,650
it come come a country like ireland it

1595
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,530
mean depends if you have an actual an

1596
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:51,180
entity that's an actual irish data

1597
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:55,460
controller then you're directly you know

1598
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,290
you know monitored and controlled by the

1599
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,860
irish DPA I was having DPO in places is

1600
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,330
a good idea it may not be a requirement

1601
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:06,450
it's me it may well become a requirement

1602
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,340
under the GDP are simply having

1603
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,110
operations in the country is not

1604
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:13,260
sufficient we have operations and almost

1605
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,420
all European companies countries but we

1606
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,250
have our data controller structure is

1607
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:20,640
set around a few key countries and then

1608
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,930
there was some discussion about how you

1609
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,270
get to G how you get a copy of the the

1610
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,009
GDP are I would say oh there was a

1611
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:28,080
question about what gr meant government

1612
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,910
relations and I would say your

1613
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:31,049
government if you have a government

1614
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:33,420
relations team they should be up to

1615
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,229
speed on the latest copy I think there's

1616
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:41,279
probably a web page either the EC or

1617
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,770
somebody probably has a web page with

1618
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,979
the latest draft legislation like we

1619
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:48,420
have in the US with pending legislation

1620
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,180
and I also it will be reporting out on

1621
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,660
it so keep an eye on our

1622
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,880
publications page the news page of the

1623
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,680

1624
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,750

1625
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:01,240
