the field of privacy and I know that

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,970
because when to offer

10

want to protect you from the color

19
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,659
my second tip I just remember the server

20
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,880
said my name is Keith Emma I am a legal

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,939
director for privacy at Google in that

22
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:19,189
past me I lead a team of lawyers around

23
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,819
the world and trying to navigate this

24
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,850
incredibly complex and increasingly

25
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,369
challenging myriad requirements they

26
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:31,640
were facing bullying I'm gonna speak to

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,490
you today slightly higher than most

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,469
people do of course a lot of course the

29
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,929
last couple days and I'm going to try to

30
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,170
share a few insights based upon Google's

31
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,209
work in the areas of privacy data

32
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:48,739
protection first like depend on BP for

33
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,379
the chance to speak to you all today and

34
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,459
I'd like to thank all of you

35
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,619
individually for giving me the chance to

36
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,599
talk to you about some of the lessons

37
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,360
that Google has learned as a result of

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,819
our experiences in the areas of privacy

39
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,649
and data protection over the course the

40
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,610
last decade now on Trevor introduced it

41
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,729
can be observed that we are all part of

42
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,590
the global conversation about practices

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,359
like that

44
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:16,579
well certainly agree that's true I'm

45
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:19,180
gonna try to take

46
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,950
employee position in your region or

47
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,440
countries in your company's hat in that

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,690
global conversation right now from the

49
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,480
perspective of a large concerned actor

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,670
like Google I really do think this

51
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,890
tremendous opportunity to pointed and I

52
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,870
want to talk about that opportunity and

53
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,440
what it looks like from our perspective

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,790
so I'm telling Google about 40 years ago

55
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,130
and when I did I had the privilege of

56
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,860
visiting cephalo Colossus in this region

57
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,150
is one of the first things I did when I

58
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,550
joined Google I spoke with ourself I'm

59
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,010
talking of the top day Shanghai and

60
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,420
Beijing and I walk during that busy as

61
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,190
someone who previously served as chief

62
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,950
asked out sir for some more domestic

63
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,070
United States corporations I had some

64
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,990
pretty firm fixed ideas of what privacy

65
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,360
is all about having a BA and I learned

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
that my ideas were not global in fact I

67
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,050
came away from from that first Asia trip

68
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,070
with really strong impression about the

69
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,020
fact that patient perceptions and

70
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,970
cultural traditions of privacy were two

71
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,010
fundamental ways distinct from those in

72
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,630
which I wasn't familiar for my own

73
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,420
experience what that did for me in my

74
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,430
roller book was really establish a

75
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,400
commitment that me and my team would

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
always remain closely engaged with our

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,810
nation always to ensure that the

78
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,420
evolution Google's privacy program would

79
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,180
remain sensitive to and informed by the

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,190
perspectives for these important markets

81
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,350
so if I think endeavor and furtherance

82
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,350
of that every past week or so I've

83
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,760
actually been traveling 50 different

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,100
countries in the region the privilege of

85
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,760
having my colleague dr. Lorenson with me

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,110
Lawrence is the director of privacy for

87
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,490
product and engineering through Google

88
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,280
and collaboratively we drive a passive

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,430
strategy to Google in addition to secure

90
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,760
legal compliance

91
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,320
now as you sir

92
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,290
and as you've been hearing here 90p for

93
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,210
the last couple of days there's a

94
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,650
tremendous amount of interest around the

95
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,380
world right now in privacy developments

96
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,680
here in the asia-pacific region as long

97
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,570
as I are meeting with regulators and

98
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,670
policy makers around the region to

99
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,610
discuss our perspectives on privacy we

100
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,440
also learned a good deal about

101
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,300
regulators views little trends and

102
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,120
development in the region so I'm going

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,470
to take a few minutes today and talk

104
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,940
about some of the things that I think we

105
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,800
learned and observed over the course of

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,260
those meetings I'm going to take back

107
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,570
and tie it just brought these and

108
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,820
suggestions about what we think this

109
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,520
might mean for all of us when the

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,110
professional interests of privacy and

111
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,700
what it means for the future of

112
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,409
technology and the future innovation

113
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,840
never have slows important meeting has

114
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,550
been reinforced for me over the course

115
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,740
of the past week is that the

116
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,140
asia-pacific region is uniquely

117
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,900
positioned to assume a global leadership

118
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,840
position with respect to creating the

119
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,750
environment here this conducive to

120
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,180
really unlocking as canvas suggesting

121
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,780
the economic social and public benefits

122
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,180
that can you realize from data and data

123
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,360
driven technologies and at least isn't

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,350
worthless that you all here in this part

125
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,720
of the world can demonstrate that you

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,120
can do that and in doing so it's not

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,880
inconsistent with strong enduring

128
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,580
commitment to protecting user privacy my

129
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,170
last point is something

130
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,610
let Google ascertain it committed to an

131
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,950
answer that would work we want to

132
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,460
provide innovative useful and privacy

133
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,040
protective products and technologies we

134
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,570
want them to improve the lives of our

135
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,620
users also my degree tremendous economic

136
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,870
opportunities resulting from the

137
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,360
flexible use of information and data

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,050
driven innovation now privacy is of

139
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,480
course essential to the long-term

140
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,130
success of that mission and Asia

141
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,170
specifically is uniquely positioned to

142
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,540
take a leadership position now in this

143
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,180
one history in this next stage of

144
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,300
technological and evolution during the

145
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,820
flexible and adaptable environment if

146
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,680
you have a small post when you continue

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,350
to cultivate here to foster innovation

148
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,480
the new deck material mediax we work

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,760
across all the cross-border privacy

150
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,940
rules has shown tremendous promise in

151
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,550
this genesis rabbah in Atlantic privacy

152
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,950
protection across the region and laying

153
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,870
a foundation for further organization

154
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,810
the interoperability principle that

155
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,120
we've been talking about on cost where

156
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,220
transfer principles that we can all

157
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,520
learn about gold each of us playing a

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,060
leading role in ensuring this global

159
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,050
level remains sensitive to the need for

160
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,710
careful consideration of a full range of

161
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,460
important social

162
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,449
dishes that are connected as the world

163
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,900
explores how to protect privacy while

164
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,720
arriving for free an efficient movement

165
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,410
of data across national borders in width

166
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,419
will allow the unlocking of this

167
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,460
tremendous economic value and it will

168
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,720
drive report on music today and tomorrow

169
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,569
I'm gonna pause permit their data driven

170
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,199
innovation does not just involve big

171
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,000
data in quotes or the way that many

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,599
people are excited to read recently

173
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,789
small businesses - are actively trying

174
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,060
to improve data processing and bet that

175
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,220
makes their own data assets to improve

176
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,259
their own productivity and to realize

177
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,500
that we for their business

178
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,699
now we can put a term data driven

179
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,099
innovation most of us evokes some image

180
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,099
of vast amounts of commercial rate of

181
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,590
the process and analyze to create value

182
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,259
for a few large stakeholders the stories

183
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,729
actually a lot more interesting a lot of

184
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,049
a process optimistic the reality of the

185
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,270
small amounts of data to drive

186
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,458
innovation in the smallest companies

187
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,420
even the most little small businesses

188
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,459
are increasingly leveraging data when

189
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,529
weather forecasts traffic patterns

190
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,260
traffic patterns in their stores and

191
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,970
which items in their stock are the most

192
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,060
popular with their specific customers to

193
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,560
drive business

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,399
and create more economic opportunity

195
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,230
this sort of value generation by small

196
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,660
businesses this critical economic

197
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,319
success in it happen around the world

198
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:13,139
for example more than 95 percent of

199
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,730
businesses in Australia are small

200
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,399
businesses and those businesses we

201
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,189
should be pointing thirty percent less

202
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:23,069
economically those ninety five percent

203
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,740
of businesses are increasingly going to

204
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,529
be looking to use the benefits of dating

205
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,410
a large and small to optimally compete

206
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,699
in tomorrow's lines now many small

207
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,800
businesses today work in relatively

208
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,019
sparse native environments without

209
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,449
access to the information resources

210
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,930
required for advanced State athletics

211
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,990
we call them middle the Netherlands

212
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,180
analyzes small data sets to give small

213
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,309
businesses insights into their own

214
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,550
customers and into their own business

215
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,259
and these types of insights are going to

216
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,779
drive tomorrow's innovation providing

217
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,910
these capabilities that make a

218
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,500
traditional derivative helpful or

219
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,649
attackers to small businesses and don't

220
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,329
have an asset so you don't have the

221
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,939
resources to leverage expensive data

222
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:14,250
acquisition hardware software her

223
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,890
infrastructure all these cater goes

224
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,840
Catholicism and it's a tremendous

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,110
economic opportunity

226
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,880
now take the feminization also the Bruce

227
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,580
governance and this is again an area

228
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,200
where Asian governments how real and

229
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,210
timely opportunity we believe the way

230
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,920
many of the social and public benefits

231
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,690
in this area aren't necessarily asleep

232
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,270
on title but their importance is various

233
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,710
levels in healthcare in an education we

234
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,510
can cut better educational and medical

235
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,030
pod accounts we can provide a more

236
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,180
efficient use of public resources

237
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,040
because Labor's would interest in elder

238
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,650
care all these issues that threaten apps

239
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,500
today view their time they develop due

240
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,910
to local nation interests they can also

241
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,750
lead to better evidence-based governance

242
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,970
by improving public access to government

243
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,710
information you can increase

244
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,140
transparency you can allow for more

245
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,170
inform public policy debate and you can

246
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,770
increase government accountability

247
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,600
now the recognition all these values

248
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,760
international can already be seen in

249
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,660
things like the Open Government

250
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,080
Partnership which currently includes 62

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,990
countries only the USA but also

252
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:39,590
Indonesia Australia so data driven

253
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,870
innovation continues to be the

254
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,750
significant potential dependent job here

255
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,500
companies have demonstrated a capacity

256
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,120
in a real foresight in leveraging data

257
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,750
to create value for shareholders and

258
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,060
that was Macy and they heard an expert

259
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,940

dollars to Japan's economy in 2014 alone

264
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,810
this constitutes 3.4 percent of Japan's

265
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,970
gross family if that were propelled by

266
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,580
2020 that number to set to more than a

267

doubling in Australian data driven in

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,520
the nation had an estimated sixty seven

billion dollars in value to Australia

270
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,690
in 2013 that's just over 4% Westerley

271
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,779
GDP which is a point of comparison is

272
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,120
roughly doubling to the retail sectors

273
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,460
complication of that market tell me

274
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,550
something about the growing critical

275
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,470
aspect of data-driven innovation in

276
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,040
local markets now every sector of the

277
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,980
Australian economy is in in the world

278
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,750

taking the lead in determination

286
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,200
Australia's governments are already

287
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,230
realized that it's more than a the

296
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,970
Singapore we see a particular example

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,230
the data.gov message important authors

298
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,180
over 8,600 datasets for public use

a one-stop geospatial data platform all

301
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,670
of these assets are now about the right

302
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,430
or to try to domestic data Technovation

303
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,920
Singapore's the top Development Party is

304
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,840
also a large number of other initiatives

305
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,440
such as the data Innovation Challenge

306
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,180
which connects the community of 500

agencies multinationals

310
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:41,260
and SMEs so now let's come back to why

311
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,140
we need driven innovation is so

312
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,090
interesting all of privacy in fact

313
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,560
privacy is not just consistent with the

314
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,080
information it is absolutely essential

315
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,060
to its long-term success experiences

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,060
show the blanket prohibitions of data

317
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,640
collection and transfer only serve to

318
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,580
limit the cycle of innovation if you

319
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,070
look across the world that the areas are

320
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,870
receiving the most valued realized

321
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,950
through data preservation big technology

322
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,080
development products you can see that it

323
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,850
closely corresponds to regions

324
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,550
it created flexibility and opportunity

325
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,400
through the free flow of information

326
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,140
encourage entrepreneurship innovation to

327
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,100
unlock the value of the assets on the

328
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,960
other hand examples of some restrictions

329
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,660
included inflexible limits on

330
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,050
accommodation and repurposing of data

331
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,660
limits on international data transfers

332
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,670
or overtly restricted for a technology

333
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,310
dependent consent requirements consent

334
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,600
requirements that presume the existence

335
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,270
of a screen and a keyboard that don't

336
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,040
necessarily hire all the mobile devices

337
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,960
where to see these challenges just

338
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,030
important whether this we can come and

339
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,610
increasingly the line of society and

340
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,300
global community to a halt and change

341
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,850
and don't necessarily not well - she

342
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,260
won't say the legal restrictions that

343
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:15,840
are required 34 mechanisms now that one

344
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,090
of those areas with tremendous value has

345
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,130
in fact that I walked through data

346
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,070
driven innovation it becomes clear that

347
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,340
the wisest course is sequentially misuse

348
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,030
of data in ways the partners that other

349
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,700
time to anticipate all the ways the data

350
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,770
might be used in the future and create

351
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,110
the prescriptive sets of rules

352
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,410
prohibiting collection data driven

353
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,350
admission will flourish under the old

354
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,670
frameworks to focus on protecting

355
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,030
privacy by addressing the harvest misses

356
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,360
rather is predicated on misguided notion

357
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,210
that all the very methods of data

358
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,900
collection abused

359
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,290
no one has this one if you look at the

360
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,550
evolution of our products and services

361
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,940
then England Scientifics we can do great

362
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,010
things for users couldn't possibly

363
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,500
contemplated at the time that public as

364
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,660
a power came up with a better way to

365
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,400
index in search area also to protect

366
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,910
users by focusing on hearts rather than

367
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,310
predictions will do a better job

368
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,680
protecting users from any adverse

369
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,050
consequences of technology they'll do a

370
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,350
better job protecting user privacy and

371
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,600
they will allow markets to realize as

372
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,560
possible now from regional level there

373
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,600
were a number of examples of population

374
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,810
privacy right area as I mentioned

375
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,090
earlier as Ken said as others except of

376
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,010
course of the last days the cross-border

377
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,620
privacy rules system using visas and

378
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,720
water companies to ensure that their

379
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,090
practices were on prosper to address

380
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,710
first comply with the minimum

381
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,930
requirements of Salvage like my privacy

382
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,340
framework this voluntary certification

383
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,070
based approach will promote a more

384
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,870
consistent set of baseline privacy

385
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,570
practices for government business in

386
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,710
participating americanus this impact

387
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,560
driven approach to establishing

388
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,450
consistent and predictable international

389
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,730
standards then reflects the diversity

390
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,660
and economic interests of this region

391
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,520
more clearly foster more internation

392
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,800
friendly environment then would be the

393
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,650
case

394
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,890
countries where it said to opt for the

395
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,990
blanket option has said European rules

396
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,410
and regulations may not solely be

397
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,130
sensitive to and respect an advanced

398
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,150
motivation all right I'm gonna take just

399
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,920
a few more minutes to talk about some

400
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,020
rules use how to best protect privacy

401
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,980
there are a number of complex

402
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,820
considerations we have to tackle when

403
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,280
we're defining practices first most

404
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,300
importantly we have to build the best

405
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,850
most useful products possible now of

406
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,220
course when we do that we need to also

407
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,530
comply with all the various laws around

408
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,450
the world to our business simple not

409
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,929
right the challenges privacy needs

410
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,140
different

411
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,990
and while regulations often aren't even

412
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,290
reflected what we is covered it's a

413
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,450
service provider our hearing from our

414
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,429
injury with respect to their

415
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,309
expectations about how services are

416
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,910
supposed to work so in fact we need to

417
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,340
reconcile and incredibly diverse and

418
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,110
increasingly diverse set of global legal

419
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,110
requirements with the important that we

420
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,750
can truly deliver great problems and

421
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,730
there are practices either remain

422
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,549
consistent with or exceed the

423
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,770
expectations of our users so we continue

424
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,210
to delight in their products to make

425
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,340
their lives better and at the same time

426
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,830
satisfy all the requirements that are in

427
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,830
those models now those who serve

428
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,480
expectations can differ right

429
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,360
that is our geography the Democratic

430
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,230
culture and in a number of other areas

431
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,540
that's a big challenge and it's one that

432
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,210
we tackle ultimately by putting these

433
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,650
are in control we do things like

434
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,090
empowering users through simple

435
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,610
meaningful controls to turn their search

436
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,080
history off return location is portal we

437
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,820
try and consolidate their sites we try

438
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,220
to give them real transparency

439
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,260
information that's used to deliver

440
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,520
Google services to them we try to give

441
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,350
them as many meaningful controls as we

442
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,059
can through the last row and their

443
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,610
outsides so the users remain in control

444
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,860
of their Google experience and users for

445
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,659
ultimately in control of how their

446
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,880
information is used to deliver services

447
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,230
to them for some reason people just

448
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,679
believe we actually work very hard to

449
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,080
let them take their game with them using

450
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,080
a service called take out we know the

451
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,770
real privacy requires very very strong

452
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,270
security with all our data breaches in

453
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,120
the marketplace you all see some sort of

454
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,740
notice at some point about a major

455
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,230
corporation and suffered a hack and

456
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,000
somewhere waiting produces a lot of

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,109
competition

458
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,729
so we're doing our best to the meat

459
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:45,609
industry in providing strong protections

460
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:50,369
for our users couple examples are

461
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,319
attacking systems that reduce the number

462
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,419
of compromised Google accounts and more

463
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:58,769
than 99 percent just since 2011

464
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:01,209
now it's hard for me to imagine a

465
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:09,909
greater advance the practices are

466
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,249
private

467
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,359
we were also one of the first companies

468
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,879
to offer the additional protection of

469
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,099
multi-factor authentication across our

470
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,859
services and we continue to require

471
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,469
improving user appearances on how to use

472
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:25,449
this technology to make it as simple as

473
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:37,149
possible so the people will start our

474
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,909
Safe Browsing technology scours the way

475
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:42,549
to identify websites when it's time to

476
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:45,149
steal passwords that contain malware

477
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,039
we're currently showing about 20 million

478
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,379
warnings to users they're about going

479
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:53,248
after potentially dangerous

480
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,770
perhaps with some wonderful things I'm

481
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,260
most proud is that we make that Safe

482
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,580
Browsing information available freely to

483
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,900
other companies mental health now full

484
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,880
analysis party and Mozilla Firefox

485
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,460
browsers rely upon Google sales of

486
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,460
technology to protect reduces internet a

487
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,240
safer place and that together we protect

488
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,700
more than 1.1 million people at work

489
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,860
making that information really available

490
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,050
ok just a few closing comments

491
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,630
resolution it's clear you all heard the

492
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,040
course of the discussion last few days

493
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,800
that perspectives on privacy certainly

494
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,220
very watching around the world but I

495
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,570
think we're also in the growing sense

496
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,230
that there isn't a shared understanding

497
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,180
that there are important societal

498
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,670
cultural individual privacy interest

499
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,670
absolutely we all work together we are

500
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,070
types of professionals we as responsible

501
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,830
protractors in parallel the regulatory

502
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,800
community of legislative community to

503
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,690
better understand what those values are

504
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,000
where there are competing interests how

505
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,330
we can improve

506
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,350
and then for us to work together

507
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,450
separately to provide these kinds of

508
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,460
services to users and to do it in the

509
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,899
way that protects these important

510
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:27,429
drivers now in fact specifically is a

511
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,279
very real opportunity as I said to be an

512
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,669
ugly nervousness the discussion of

513
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,350
shared identity of the last couple of

514
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,409
days really just product list into a

515
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,570
handful of unique opportunities and

516
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,840
challenges we have a privacy space not

517
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,889
only in this region that are not world

518
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:50,529
data driven innovation will be critical

519
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,509
where the person success growth and

520
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:59,190
success of the ex-cons and price

521
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,830
specifically provide us a very real

522
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,919
opportunity for a pack to seize the

523
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,740
global competitive advantage for

524
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,049
companies meadows located here somehow

525
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:18,940
so that thank you have unique

526
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,419
opportunity I thought a lot the chance

527
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,720
to engage
