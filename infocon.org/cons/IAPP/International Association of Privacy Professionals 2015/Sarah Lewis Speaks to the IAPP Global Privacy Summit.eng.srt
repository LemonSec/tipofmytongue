writing her latest book the rise

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,349
creativity the gift of failure and the

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,489
search for mastery she discovered that

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,730
privacy and a safe place to work are

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,879
vital to the creation of great art

11
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,550
please join me in welcoming to the stage

12

Sarah Walker

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,910
good afternoon good afternoon all right

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,770
I I'm thrilled to be here I told my my

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,600
god daughter who is around five years

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,339
old I was coming to this conference and

17
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,560
she thought I said a conference on

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,890
pirates and creativity and she she sent

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,360
me this beautiful drawing and I thought

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,790
oh sooner and later in life she'll learn

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,240
more about privacy it's crucial role in

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,380
innovation and that is what I'm here to

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,350
speak about today and I'd like to begin

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,000
by telling you a brief story about a

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,560
century ago downtown and New York City

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,720
Washington Square a painter was at work

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,790
on an invention that would change our

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,899
world he was NYU's first professor of

29
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:44,100
painting he spent 26 years with the

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,580
ambition to rival a Michelangelo Raphael

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,110
a Titian but there in that studio he

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,440
considered destroying every canvas on

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,560
which he'd ever laid his brush he

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,900
encountered every imaginable type of

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,420
critique he couldn't support his family

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,390
sent them to live in new haven where the

37
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,519
cost of living was lower and he remained

38
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,250
in New York but ultimately felt as he

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,630
put it jilted by his art this painter

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,870
was Samuel Morse and he converted the

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,690
stretcher bars of one of his failed

42
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,130
canvases into the model of the Telegraph

43
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,350
this Telegraph now sits on loan from the

44
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,750
Smithsonian in the oval office at the

45
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,320
white house because it's difficult to

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,630
imagine it now but at the time this

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,930
lightning line as it was called was seen

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,590
as an unprecedented discovery and as

49
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,570
many journalists put it the greatest

50
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,500
achievement of the human mind news that

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,890
used to take two weeks to travel as the

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,420
news of the signing of the Declaration

53
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,270
independence

54
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,970
now was instantaneous morse though spent

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,880
years tinkering with this Telegraph

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,010
model without wanting anyone to see it

57
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,260
he only showed it to a few trusted

58
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,560
relatives and a few stalwart students

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,130
and only uncloaked it when he thought

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,500
someone might beat him to the punch and

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,190
have their model of the Telegraph went

62
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,940
out I mentioned the story because Morse

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,220
is describing a timeless feature of

64
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,870
creativity that I'd like to speak about

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,280
more today I wrote about this internal

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,370
landscape of creative individuals as I

67
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,410
penned this book entitled the rise

68
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,720
creativity the gift of failure in the

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,610
search for mastery this is an earlier

70
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,380
version when the subtitle was different

71
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,200
and I realized that there are many

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,410
different stories that often display how

73
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,620
uncommon the foundation is of someone's

74
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,590
iconic rise I'll tell you a few examples

75
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,250
I learned for example that Duke

76
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,370
Ellington said about his legendary music

77
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,040
I merely take the energy it takes to

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,540
pout and I write some blues I learn that

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,880
Paul Taylor the dancer and choreographer

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,649
had his early now iconic style soap and

81
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,560
that the reviewer left the newsprint

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,490
completely blank right it was so minimal

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,990
as the reviewers said well if Lewis

84
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,060
horst what Paul Taylor won't dance I

85
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,920
won't write at he left it simply this

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,420
way many stories Thomas Edison told his

87
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,250
assistant incredulous of the inventors

88
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,870
repeated attempts to invent the

89
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,150
incandescent light bulb I have not

90
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,790
failed i've just found 10,000 ways that

91
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,730
won't work and learned about all these

92
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,590
different private experiences that

93
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,620
rarely come to light the 1930s RKO

94
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,540
screen test sted at one point can't sing

95
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,010
can't act balding can dance a little and

96
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,820
this was in reference to Fred Astaire

97
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,170
I learned that Martin Luther King

98
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,800
received in seminary sees in a

99
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,290
transcript of A's and B's and can you

100
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,390
guess what class in public speaking not

101
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,170
once but twice C plus then see when it

102
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,750
was worse and this private story has

103
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,190
rarely come to light we hear about more

104
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,620
of these private stories at commencement

105
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,230
time when speakers who have reached a

106
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,360
pinnacle of success finally feel

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,940
comfortable revealing the true arc and

108
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,780
journey that brought them to that stage

109
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,090
so it's then that for example JK Rowling

110
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,820
when she went to Harvard in 2008 spoke

111
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,260
about what she called the fringe

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,740
benefits of failure she spoke about how

113
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,810
rock bottom for her became the solid

114
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,400
foundation on which she built her rise

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,310
and Oprah Winfrey went to Harvard again

116
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,960
and spoke about the importance of

117
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,710
failure as I had some distance from

118
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,100
writing this book I realized that all of

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,540
these individuals despite their

120
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,580
different journeys displayed a central

121
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,510
crucial trait they were all able to see

122
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,620
something before it happened like Samuel

123
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,570
Morse they were able to see that this

124
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,050
crude contraption could become the start

125
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,710
of the communications revolution and

126
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,370
what that required was a safe haven a

127
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,080
private domain to protect themselves

128
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,470
from iconoclastic premature critique now

129
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,040
it sounds very simple this idea but I

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,860
think at this moment there is urgency to

131
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,400
speak about it as a former curator at

132
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,040
MoMA and the Tate Modern and faculty

133
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,450
member at Yale School Board I'm often

134
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,260
asked by young artists of all kinds how

135
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,450
do I get my work discovered how can I

136
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,840
get seen there's such a trend for people

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,030
to get their work out there on various

138
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,310
platforms Instagram YouTube you name it

139
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,330
and what it means is that we are losing

140
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,830
I believe our sense and

141
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,780
sting to understand a timeless feature

142
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,920
of the creative process showing your

143
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,530
work too early can help you find an

144
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,410
audience but being too conscious of your

145
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,350
audience can unhinge you from your own

146
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,670
creative self in other words creativity

147
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,270
has a growth pattern to it as in life it

148
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,930
starts with an embryonic stage artists

149
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,550
of all kinds understand this

150
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,640
instinctively in a recent interview that

151
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,180
Chris Rock gave to vulture magazine he

152
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,000
lamented the fact that smartphones and

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
comedy clubs have meant that well-known

154
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,820
comedians have few chances to practice

155
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,850
new material in other words the

156
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,670
rehearsal space has become too public

157
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,070
too early Duran Duran keyboardist Nick

158
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,800
Rhodes spoke about this in much the same

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,000
way thinking back nostalgically on the

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,310
1980s when bands could develop

161
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,200
organically in front of an audience

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,740
without fear of their near win work

163
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,990
making it to the public stage

164
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,440
prematurely I learned this the hard way

165
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,480
myself when I was writing a chapter of

166
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,820
the rise I showed my editor a section on

167
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,429
then lesser-known figure who had come to

168
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,250
know in Silicon Valley his name is

169
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,890
Travis cowl neck and he was starting a

170
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,370
taxi company of sorts he went on to

171
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,970
become the CEO of uber and by revealing

172
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,340
this chapter too early in an embryonic

173
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,010
stage I lost six months of work and is

174
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,230
really paralyzed by the premature

175
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,090
critique wild Chavez kalmyks revelations

176
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,850
are still in the rise I think of that

177
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,940
salient moment as sort of detonation for

178
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,780
me and understanding this idea

179
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,370
thankfully alongside writing the rise i

180
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,940
had read every interview i could find in

181
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,640
the paris review the legendary journal

182
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,450
that has interviewed every artist

183
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,520
30 you know create a person that you

184
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,780
could imagine I made this insane chart

185
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,870
of the key features that each individual

186
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,680
discussed was crucial for their process

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,220
from my Angela to Ray Bradbury and

188
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,740
private domains ranked high on this

189
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,480
chart in this list my Angela for example

190
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,940
would mention that no matter what city

191
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,580
she was in even if she had a home there

192
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,580
and she wanted to create she would rent

193
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,940
a hotel room all she needed was that

194
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,970
hotel room a good dictionary and a

195
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,550
bottle of sherry she would get there at

196
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,140
five in the morning without fail and

197
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,150
would work until noon and then would

198
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,190
re-enter the world pretend to be normal

199
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,120
as she put it raid Bradbury's process

200
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,020
was much the same susan sontag has this

201
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,200
process in which she refuses lunch dates

202
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
even with close friends in order to

203
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,610
maintain the privacy required for

204
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,760
creativity perhaps the most famous

205
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,960
example comes from the image of Albert

206
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,240
Einstein's office here in 1955 on the

207
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,010
last day of his life at the Institute of

208
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,540
Advanced Study at Princeton Einstein

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,260
described his office here and prior ones

210
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,770
as the quote worldly cloister where he

211
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,670
hatched his most beautiful ideas but

212
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,550
that term worldly cloister hints at the

213
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,030
paradox of creativity it reminds us of

214
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,090
this putting something out into the

215
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,570
world requires a temporary removal from

216
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,830
it I started to realize that these

217
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,930
private domains have nothing to do with

218
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,650
actual space they're about cultivating a

219
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,750
space within ourselves a space where we

220
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,580
can shield ourselves from our own

221
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,840
overgrown inner critics our bodies

222
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,800
remind us of this even when we forget

223
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,060
just consider what happens in the mind

224
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,420
when jazz means you

225
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,690
musicians improvise Allen Braun and my

226
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,910
friend and colleague Charles limb at

227
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,139
Johns Hopkins have a study about this

228
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,420
they invited musicians to improvise a

229
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,420
piece of music and then also to play a

230
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,329
piece of memorized music while hooked up

231
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,560
in an fMRI imaging scanner what they

232
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,500
found is that during improvisation areas

233
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,420
of the musicians brain involved with

234
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,990
self expression lit up and those

235
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,019
involved with self-judgment were

236
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,769
suppressed that is to say when musicians

237
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,019
are improvising the brain is offering

238
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,240
them a private space that is protected

239
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,199
from their own inner critic in fact the

240
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,870
closest the brain comes to this state is

241
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,380
in the REM state of dreaming when we

242
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,470
have no one to fear and our ideas are

243
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,920
completely our own why is it so

244
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,010
important well when the mind barricades

245
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,890
itself from critique we have the

246
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,470
permission to put out into the world are

247
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,920
iconic classic ideas there are many

248
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,110
different domains that have benefited

249
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,860
from creating a structure for employees

250
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,110
or colleagues to reap the benefits of

251
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,190
this sort of innovation think about this

252
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,209
in the context of science labs and then

253
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,440
the entertainment industry and Hollywood

254
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,540
recently the nobel prize was won by two

255
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,329
men andre gide and diamond konstantinova

256
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:20,410
slav in the UK who known for a practice

257
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,050
in their laboratory of what they call

258
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,440
friday night experiments times where

259
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,199
they permit themselves in this sort of

260
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,230
safety of this safe haven to ask

261
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,310
questions that experts wouldn't dare

262
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,459
from it they were allowed to retain some

263
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,240
curiosity of the child free from the

264
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,490
shame that this bracketed time allowed

265
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,000
for and during this period they asked

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,329
themselves curious about two dimensional

267
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,089
objects

268
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,209
send carbon and graphite being used to

269
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,819
discover it whether or not something as

270
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:01,540
simple as scotch tape and the graphite

271
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,819
hanging out and ordinary pencil could be

272
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:08,959
the key to discovering it they took out

273
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,139
of a waste bin scotch tape and graphite

274
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,180
hanging out there from a related

275
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,279
experiment put it under the microscope

276
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,199
and found that they had the thinnest

277
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,680
recorded attempt on record over the

278
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,649
16-month period they fancied up this

279
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,220
technique had their findings rejected by

280
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,649
the preeminent journal nature which is

281
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,600
such a frequent occurrence for

282
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,309
innovation it should be an unintended

283
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:39,230
compliment Andre guy loves recounting

284
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,259
this story he did so when he won the

285
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,829
Nobel Prize and gave his speech and in

286
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,019
the interview he said you know about my

287
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,120
work he said sometimes I say I don't

288
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,499
research I only search what's required

289
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,290
for that the difficult journey that that

290
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,259
allows for is being able to summon the

291
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:03,259
courage to be iconoclastic and the play

292
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,269
that let's us remain supple and nimble

293
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,350
enough to go on that journey under

294
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,689
guymon konstantin novoselov are known in

295
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,670
effect for being deliberate amateurs

296
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,179
right committable men playful men

297
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:20,720
deliberate amateurs and the way to allow

298
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,970
this to be possible in their laboratory

299
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,209
is by having a structured time a private

300
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,209
space in order to harness the gains from

301
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:32,720
that mode of thought many other

302
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,329
organizations have analogous examples

303
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,629
Google's twenty percent time in effect

304
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,639
as a friday night experiment time and

305
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,749
there many others but the most vivid

306
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:48,350
example for me comes from Hollywood we

307
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,100
may never have seen these films Juno

308
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,559
some dog millionaire and Lars and the

309
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,379
real girl if not for the private domain

310
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:01,429
created by the blacklist this is not the

311
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,630
Communist blacklist or the HBO

312
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,600
that show the blacklist but a document

313
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,510
the very artful setup that a man named

314
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,310
Franklin Leonard created when he was

315
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,810
working at Leonardo DiCaprio's

316
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,370
production company he wanted to find

317
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,790
excellent screenplays unusual documents

318
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,520
and found it difficult because every

319
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,470
year the Writers Guild of America states

320
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,900
that there are 50,000 new screenplays

321
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,180
and if you did nothing but read

322
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,610
screenplays all year long you could get

323
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,090
through about a thousand so he decided

324
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,580
to harness the minds and power of his

325
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,060
friends to identify new properties so he

326
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,740
wrote anonymously to 85 colleagues

327
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,270
please tell me the screenplays that you

328
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,110
secretly love but that you don't think

329
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,100
will be in theaters in the next year and

330
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,100
that you think might not have a chance

331
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,060
of really getting made nearly all did as

332
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,369
they were asked and Franklin tabulated

333
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:10,380
the answers in a document via Excel

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,060
sorted by the amount of votes or

335
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,099
mentions that each screenplay received

336
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,099
and then it was 2005 he went on vacation

337
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,650
and turned off his phone as he could

338
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,230
then came back and saw that this

339
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,189
document had gone viral in Hollywood

340
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,130
development surely stopped that day as

341
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,110
people saw that films that were seen as

342
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,640
failed documents had been recast as ones

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,450
to watch films like things we lost in

344
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,100
the fire Juno Lars and the real girl

345
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,020
films that were nominated for academy

346
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,270
awards that year from this annual

347
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,070
document which has become now a Netflix

348
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,650
like rolling list we also received the

349
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,980
King's Speech David Seidler told me he

350
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,720
was 74 meant when he wrote this that it

351
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,400
was his last will and testament but he

352
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,490
didn't dare shop it around Hollywood his

353
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,080
son told him that no one would want to

354
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,360
watch a film about a man stuttering the

355
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,770
entire

356
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,120
time so he didn't even try instead it

357
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,740
was going to be a humble television

358
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,160
production until it landed on what's

359
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
called the brit list this has become so

360
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,910
impactful for Hollywood there's a

361
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,700
British version it then landed on the

362
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,040
blacklist the following year Harvey

363
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,020
Weinstein's saw it and you know what

364
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,510
happened next it was made for 15 million

365
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,030
it grows 500 million it was nominated

366
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,200
for 12 Academy Awards of which at 14

367
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,500
including Best Original Screenplay Woody

368
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,470
Allen bested the record for the oldest

369
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,740
person to win in that category which set

370
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,630
up this joking rivalry between David

371
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,840
Seidler and Woody Allen David told me I

372
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,000
said to woody last one to win an Oscar

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,380
over a hundred is a rotten egg he said

374
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,050
but why is this list so impactful well

375
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,380
what it really did was create a way for

376
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,330
iconic classic decisions to come to

377
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,120
light in Hollywood Hollywood is like

378
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,620
many industries in which the Asch

379
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,620
experiment is constantly going on the

380
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,500
Asch experiment was executed in the

381
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,980
1950s by Solomon Asch and he effectively

382
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,990
found that there's something even worse

383
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,090
than peer pressure at work when people

384
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,330
are faced with an innovative idea in a

385
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,380
group context he asked subjects simple

386
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,050
question in isolation they all gave the

387
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,760
right answer to the question which line

388
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,310
on the left is equivalent to the line on

389
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,260
the right ninety-five percent of the

390
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,380
time you'll all tell me line two but

391
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,500
when he asked subjects to still give the

392
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,130
correct answer but had paid off a set of

393
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,440
other subjects to her giving the wrong

394
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,980
answer the correct response rate dropped

395
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,880
to twenty-five percent it's almost

396
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,170
unconscionable unimaginable people

397
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,510
replicated this experiment for years and

398
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,030
did so in the same year that the block

399
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,210
list came out Nero economist Gregory

400
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,340
burns replicated it and again put

401
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,890
subjects in an fMRI scanner to see what

402
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,620
is in fact going on when we give up on

403
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,720
our own correct view and effect

404
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,610
what he found is that this isn't simply

405
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,880
about peer pressure the body pays a

406
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,030
price when we're going against a group

407
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,610
opinion and are perceiving it ourselves

408
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,090
in that moment of being a dissenter he

409
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,280
found that the amygdala is activated in

410
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,770
these moments the fear or lighter flight

411
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,320
sensation that happens to us in certain

412
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,159
circumstances happens in that moment but

413
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,990
most importantly when he asked subjects

414
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,520
that they knew they were giving up on

415
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,900
the obvious correct answer they did not

416
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,250
how many times have you been in a

417
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,950
meeting and perhaps suppressed the

418
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,049
innovative idea that in fact would have

419
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,210
helped you your organization your

420
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,809
company the Asch experiment doesn't work

421
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,030
in Hollywood as it has to adjudicate

422
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,150
between properties which film will make

423
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,520
it based on a past metric of success and

424
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,490
without knowing it these executives

425
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,860
oftentimes we're not advocating for

426
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,500
unusual films like Lars and the real

427
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,750
girl and if you know the plot for that

428
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,460
movie you know why it might be difficult

429
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,289
to say to your colleagues I really

430
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,890
believe in this film in some ways it

431
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,539
shouldn't be so surprising that we need

432
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,940
these private domains for the creation

433
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,640
of art because after all creative works

434
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,159
that move us and evitable create a

435
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,539
private domain in us Thomas Jefferson

436
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,000
said it said it best he stood in front

437
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,549
of a painting and wrote to his friend

438
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,059
about it it fixed me like a statue a

439
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:57,909
quarter of an hour or half an hour I do

440
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:00,640
not know which for i lost all ideas of

441
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,190
time even the consciousness of my own

442
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,299
existence a private distaste develops an

443
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,100
ass where we can summon the bravery to

444
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,650
see the world differently to go against

445
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,429
popular opinion dr. Douglas talked about

446
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:17,500
this during the Civil War as did the

447
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,559
legendary constitutional lawyer Charles

448
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,799
black who remembered being in Austin

449
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,820
Texas one day 1931 and saw this trumpet

450
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,520
player Louis Armstrong who so impressed

451
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,230
him with his genius although he'd never

452
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,049
heard of him before that he knew

453
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,750
segregation must be wrong he knew in

454
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,340
that moment that he was going to walk

455
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,490
towards justice as he did becoming one

456
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,230
of the first lawyers for Brown versus

457
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,350
Board of Education at Columbia and Yale

458
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,260
where he went on faculty he held an

459
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,990
annual Armstrong listening night to

460
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,899
honor that inner space that shifted in

461
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:58,539
him and that ultimately shifted our

462
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:02,860
world so I would say that while we are

463
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,470
in a place of encouraging transparency

464
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,840
regarding creativity it's not unusual or

465
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,880
wrong headed to look at the importance

466
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,840
of privacy as a way of understanding how

467
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,409
new ideas are executed in many cases

468
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:23,260
privacy has been the only way that we've

469
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,200
created the innovative ideas that we are

470
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,270
honored to celebrate thank
