1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,200
I can't actually see anybody out there I

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,240
was so excited when Trevor asked me to

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,099
come to this event and to put together a

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,980
group of artists to talk to you if you

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,020
look to the right of you right now or to

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,550
the left of you at the person sitting

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,859
next to you they may indeed be an artist

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,279
we are among you

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,050
as we speak my my art practice involves

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,950
data and in those most specifically the

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,100
human experience of data and and I think

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,280
a lot about what is it like for for the

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,250
everyday person to be in this new world

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,800
of data and and and maybe because this

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,750
is a maybe a biased model because I do a

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,090
lot of traveling but I think about the

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,270
air traffic system as an analogy so the

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,430
air traffic system when when you're in

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,739
it and you're traveling is a system of

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,109
almost unimaginable complexity and we

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,619
only see it in small glimpses we see our

22
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,080
bags disappearing down these strange

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,040
runways and we see the fueling systems

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
come in and connect to the plane as we

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,939
run on the runway but we don't really

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,400
get a feeling of the whole of it you

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,810
know I was surprised to find out when we

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,509
were working on this project that at any

29
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:22,979
given time there are more than a million

30
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,229
people in the air and what you're seeing

31
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,729
here is you're seeing this almost

32
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,240
respiring system of planes landing and

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
taking off on 15-minute intervals

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,710
throughout the day now the second thing

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,850
that I think about when I think about

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,409
the air traffic system is they think

37
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,570
about this loss of control it's one of

38
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,189
the only times in our lives that we

39
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,189
voluntarily give up our control we're

40
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,189
putting these lineups in and we really

41
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,229
do what we are told for a short period

42
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,619
of time and I think that our everyday

43
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,149
experience with data maybe is similar to

44
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,799
this we are engaging with a very

45
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,719
complicated system and we're doing so

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,439
very much out of our own control and I'm

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,149
not the first artist to think about this

48
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,479
David Foster Wallace merican novelist

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,008
wrote a book called Infinite Jest

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,959
Infinite Jest is it very interesting

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,650
novel it is it's full of footnotes

52
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,390
occasionally those footnotes have

53
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,459
footnotes and and even sometimes those

54
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,810
footnotes of the footnotes have

55
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,629
footnotes and when he was asked by his

56
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,640
editor why he was including this he

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,230
responded that he said he wanted to

58
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,180
mimic the information flood and data

59
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,640
triage that he expected to be an even

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,519
bigger part of life 15 years hence and I

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,260
think that this idea is something that

62
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,060
we are all all of us in this room

63
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,670
wrestling with now this need in this

64
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,409
this desire for data triage my own work

65
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:46,459
in it involves quite quite a focus on on

66
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,030
how information is used in ways that we

67
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,950
may not be aware of this is a piece that

68
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,019
I did a number of years ago called just

69
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,489
landed and what I'm doing and just

70
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,069
landed is I'm looking at tweets that you

71
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,720
probably have seen if you're on Twitter

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,000
of people saying I just landed in Hawaii

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,090
or I just landed in London in these kind

74
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,030
of rich person vanity tweets and I

75
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,250
thought we could take these these vanity

76
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,930
tweets and maybe make some utility out

77
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,269
of it by using it to a to create a model

78
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,810
of human travel and and this piece has a

79
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,540
companion called good morning which is

80
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,579
just that it's everybody on Twitter

81
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,030
saying good morning so here the people

82
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,579
who are represented by green blocks

83
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,019
those are people who get up quite early

84
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,090
the people who are red blocks are

85
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,650
getting up much later as we sweep

86
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,540
through North America you see lots of

87
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,450
red blocks on the west coast

88
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,270
so as as Trevor mentioned I worked at

89
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,530
the New York Times for two and a half

90
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,380
years as the data artist-in-residence

91
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,520
some of you are asking this question so

92
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,660
I'll answer it I made up that title

93
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,560
myself and and at the Times we took some

94
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,930
of these ideas and we tried to make them

95
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,760
into something a little bit more

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,770
practical and we built this project

97
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,470
called cascade and cascade is a project

98
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,370
that looks at how people are sharing

99
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,080
times content over the Internet so on

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,640
the bottom left-hand side is the first

101
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,470
tweet about this particular story and

102
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,780
what we're seeing is one conversation

103
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,810
that surrounds that story so very much I

104
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,279
was interested in how we couldn't we

105
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,168
take something that is invisible that is

106
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,418
inherently invisible and make it into

107
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,610
something make it into an architectural

108
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,590
form that we can then think with that we

109
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,880
can engage with and that we can

110
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,639
understand when I left the Times in

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,320
January I started a company called the

112
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,690
office for creative research and with

113
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,010
the office for creative research we're

114
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,889
very interested in in changing the way

115
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,200
people think about data and changing the

116
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,600
way that people experience data and one

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,890
of the ways that we do that is by

118
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,930
bringing data into public space this is

119
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,669
a piece that we installed it's a

120
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,860
permanent installation at the university

121
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,320
of texas call them that's the way it is

122
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,570
this is five stories tall and a hundred

123
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,520
and forty feet wide it runs every night

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
and what it does is it does these

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,950
linguistic data games with the content

126
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,080
of the news broadcast from every single

127
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,000
day so this is a broadcast from last

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,610
summer there were floods or droughts in

129
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,860
Colorado so we see withering corn the

130
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,380
droughts dry earth hungry cattle the

131
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,410
worst and and as people are standing in

132
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,210
front of this building they're receiving

133
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,760
a much different experience of data than

134
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,800
the experience that they're used to and

135
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,900
because what we're actually trying to do

136
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,010
is we're trying to change the

137
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,229
conversation around data is the

138
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,690
conversation around data as it sits

139
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,630
right now involves involves a lot of

140
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,389
terms like this this is essentially if

141
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:37,430
you had to distill what I'm trying to do

142
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,070
with my work is I'm trying to provide a

143
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,010
counterbalance to this this is a phrase

144
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,660
that I've heard over and over and over

145
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,490
again the people that are saying it I

146
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,770
think they're thinking about this

147
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,620
okay but uh but III well I'm I'm

148
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,810
thinking about this as well but in a

149
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,630
context of this in our experience with

150
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,270
oil is not a particularly good one and

151
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,600
the idea of data being the new oil may

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,940
in fact be the case but not in the

153
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,380
context that I think the current

154
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,620
conversation is is is focusing it so

155
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,330
what I was excited about with the

156
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,190
opportunity here at navigate was to

157
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,810
bring some artists that will help us

158
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,420
think about our conversation around data

159
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,140
in privacy in different ways and so I I

160
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,100
rammed it up three of who artists who I

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,320
think are probably the best possible

162
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,910
choices that I could have I could have

163
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,410
made and I was thrilled that they all

164
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,020
said yes so we have three artists who

165
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,340
are gonna be working in very different

166
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,200
areas I'm not gonna take a lot of time

167
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,670
to explain their practice because I'm

168
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,440
gonna leave it to them but we have Kyle

169
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,020
McDonald whose work largely surrounds

170
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,660
this concept of how do we how do we see

171
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,240
and how are we seeing the act of seeing

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,210
and the act of being seen we have Lauren

173
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,370
McCarthy who you're gonna see in just a

174
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,920
second whose work involves human

175
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,020
interactions and how our human

176
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,360
interactions are changing and finally we

177
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,430
have Heather do we have Berg who's gonna

178
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,290
take us into I think the future of

179
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,290
privacy issues by thinking about very

180
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,000
deeply about about topics like DNA so I

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,310
invited these artists here they all said

182
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,990
yes there are a couple of reasons I

183
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,700
think they said yes but one of the

184
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,620
primary ones besides legal

185
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,150
representation I think a lot of them are

186
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,000
looking for legal representation you'll

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,480
find out why when you see them talk I

188
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,010
think most of them and myself included

189
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,660
are primarily excited about the

190
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,940
conversations that we can have today so

191
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,460
after we're off the stage please feel

192
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,200
free to come up and talk to us because

193
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,880
that's really why we're here to advance

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,740
the conversation and to advance the

195
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,830
dialogue so I hope you enjoy what we

196
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,690
have are going to bring to the event and

197
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,160
I look forward to talking to all of you

198
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,910
thanks
