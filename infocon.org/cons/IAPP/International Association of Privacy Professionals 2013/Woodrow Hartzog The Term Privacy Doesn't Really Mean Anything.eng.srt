1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,389
I always wanted walkout music and now I

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,460
think I can die happy that I have is

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,320
able to walk out to music it's great to

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,440
see you all here or not see you all here

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,170
but it's dangerous to ask a law

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,910
professor their opinion on more or less

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,470
anything but I will do my best to keep

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,830
it within the allotted time frame so I

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,210
think privacy has a problem and by that

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,360
I don't mean all that we consider to be

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,809
privacy but rather the term itself has a

12
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,700
problem and that's what it doesn't

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,840
really need anything if it ever did

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,930
privacy has ceased to be an effective

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,950
term to guide policy in the United

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,969
States and around the world I think

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,610
because it could mean so many different

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,489
things than what usually happens is we

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,440
end up talking past each other in a

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,719
number of different instances where we

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,629
might actually agree if we just define

22
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,740
what this term meant and so let me give

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,830
an example earlier this year Facebook

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,140
rolled out their new graph search

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,360
feature and I know that most of you are

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,610
probably certainly their Facebook users

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,229
are probably now familiar with that

28
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,860
feature and initially of course you know

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,150
as it happens anytime there's a new

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,310
product rollout for any kind of social

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,530
technology the hands went up and people

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,759
said well now they're gonna be some

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,670
privacy issues with this and thanks book

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,500
and a lot of other journalists and other

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,659
advocates wrote back and to try to

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,150
assuage our fears and they said well you

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,680
know there aren't really going to be any

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,960
privacy issues with this because nobody

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,590
new is seeing your information the same

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,450
people that could see your information

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,939
before will now have the same visibility

42
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,680
that they could afterwards and so

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,439
there's no privacy problems associated

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,009
with that I think this is problematic I

45
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,770
actually think that this is wrong I

46
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,960
think that this argument is based on a

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,818
common misunderstanding of the privacy

48
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,459
implications of sharing information

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,950
particularly socially with

50
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,650
one another and one of the points that I

51
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,739
hope to make today is that the law is

52
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,000
terrible about this the law has it's

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,910
very inconsistent about trying to

54
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,340
determine when self disclosed

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,640
information is private and what I think

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,099
we usually end up doing and many various

57
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,510
different contexts in the law is saying

58
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,610
well did you disclose it to a lot of

59
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,920
other people you did not try it or its

60
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,750
public and you hear this argument all

61
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,640
the time as an effect earlier today one

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,110
of our panelists made the assertion that

63
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,730
if you post something on facebook then

64
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,400
it's out there and it's public and I'd

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,160
like to push back on that because I

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,470
don't think that's reality it may be

67
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,930
that we feel that way but that's not I

68
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,590
think how most people consider their

69
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,989
communications nor do I think it's the

70
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,030
desirable states that we should steer

71
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,220
our privacy policy because I think that

72
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,690
there's a distinction between

73
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,519
information that is theoretically

74
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,450
accessible by some and perhaps

75
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,269
universally consumed by a significantly

76
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,230
larger group so and Jason actually

77
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,000
brought up earlier today the Erving

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,799
Goffman and Erving kind of gets into a

79
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,600
lot of this with what we disclose some

80
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,760
kinds of information to some people but

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
we would wish to withhold that

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,019
information from others and one of the

83
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,639
metaphors has been used as kind of this

84
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,160
front stage in the backstage and we need

85
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,840
a place where we can perform front stage

86
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,970
and then let our hair down backstage and

87
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,200
where our front stage might be for some

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,670
people it could be different for other

89
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,980
people so by a show of hands and I do

90
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,069
think I can make out hands here how many

91
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,519
here have personal information that

92
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,750
exists somewhere online but you are so

93
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,630
so thankful that it is not indexed by a

94
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,160
general search engine like Google or

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,609
Bing

96
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,410
show of hands just generally speaking

97
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,739
okay so that's at least half I mean the

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,269
other other half of you are probably

99
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,310
lying or at least you're not thinking

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,329
about it because unless you you know are

101
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,120
you know maybe in the 1% of the and

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,620
maybe this is the wrong audience to ask

103
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,599
I get a different result when I when I

104
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,740
asked my students

105
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,790
whoo-hoo start to think about the things

106
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,110
that they posted about five years ago

107
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,790
and say yeah I'm really glad that

108
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,220
doesn't show up in Google how many

109
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,220
people here have taken advantage of some

110
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,760
kind of access control or privacy

111
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,950
setting on a social technology so you

112
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,020
utilize yeah okay see all the hands

113
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,300
shoot up

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,850
who here has tried to use either a

115
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,210
pseudonym or some kind of named variant

116
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,470
so for me I would be woody or rwh or the

117
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,930
wood man or the woodster anyone here

118
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,670
all right so most of these um and

119
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,800
finally how many of you I don't you to

120
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,270
think about this for a second how many

121
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,070
of you have posted something online in a

122
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,780
social way so in some kind of social

123
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,270
communication and you knew that it was

124
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,210
going to a relatively large audience but

125
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,370
you crafted your communication in such a

126
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,560
way that would only be understood by a

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,169
small group of people so for example I

128
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,090
would could log on to Facebook and I

129
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,000
would say I totally nailed it and my

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,620
friends that didn't know I was taking a

131
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,870
test would have no idea what that means

132
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,950
my friends that knew that I've been

133
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,470
studying for the bar exam for the past

134
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,970
three months would say all right way to

135
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,560
go so who's done something like that

136
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,770
intentionally so so a pretty good show

137
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,229
of hands so everyone that raised their

138
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,520
hand has utilized two relied upon

139
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,590
something that I think we all rely upon

140
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,419
to protect our privacy perhaps more than

141
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,169
anything else and that's the concept of

142
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,060
obscurity and the concept of obscurity

143
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,600
is a context in which information has a

144
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,250
very low probability of being found or

145
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,540
understood by people that you don't want

146
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,640
to find or understand it I think it's

147
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,500
relied upon not only in our online

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,270
interaction but it's a part of our

149
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,729
everyday life and I bring this up

150
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,810
because I think that this is an

151
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,720
extremely underdeveloped legal concept

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,640
and I think it's an extremely although

153
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,800
perhaps less so underdeveloped design

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,810
concept I mean I think that we could

155
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,660
embrace this concept better moving

156
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,790
forward as a way to ease numerous

157
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,860
tensions in the law and be a little bit

158
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,780
more specific about what we're talking

159
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,950
about when we say

160
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,290
that term privacy which i think is a

161
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,180
very problematic term or at least it's

162
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,420
so value Laden and stretched that it's

163
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,400
really not helpful anymore so I hope to

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,020
make three points during this talk first

165
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,130
I hope to define

166
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,560
online obscurity and maybe obscurity

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,210
more generally and a clear and useful

168
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,660
way I hope to point out areas in which

169
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,250
the law has been terrible about

170
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,410
recognizing the purity where it should

171
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,900
and areas where the law has implicitly

172
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,360
valued obscurity but that's not the term

173
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,400
that we use to describe it and any of

174
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,960
this framework could help us to justify

175
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,940
a lot of laws that we might question

176
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,910
it's ineffective and finally I want to

177
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,010
propose a few different ways that it's

178
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,110
that we could embrace obscurity even

179
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,510
better both in the law and in the design

180
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,610
of technologies that deal with personal

181
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,670
information so first what does it mean

182
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,230
to be obscure we experience the concept

183
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,840
of obscurity all the time in our

184
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,660
everyday life most of our daily

185
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,990
experience is actually lived largely in

186
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,900
a zone of obscurity our social setting

187
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,570
so consider for example the plane ride

188
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,370
that you took to get here can you

189
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,860
remember the face of more than one

190
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,810
person that was on that plane I'm

191
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,240
guessing probably not unless you are an

192
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,400
incredible memory in which case Bravo

193
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
but you probably only remember one or

194
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
two people when you sit at a restaurant

195
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,240
people sit all around you but you don't

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,280
listen to most of their conversations

197
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,050
don't even register that they're there

198
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,960
you're living life in this zone of

199
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,110
obscurity

200
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,290
I think that's obscurity of the reason

201
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,110
that the statement you have no privacy

202
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,950
in public is dead wrong I think that we

203
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,470
recognize at least we desire and count

204
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,490
on having privacy in public all the time

205
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,000
for example I leadoff my privacy seminar

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,310
every semester by asking a question um

207
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,200
do we have any privacy in public and I

208
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,270
kind of phrase it in a way where I'm

209
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,620
kind of telegraphing the idea and my

210
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,510
students say oh no there's no privacy in

211
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,590
public and and I you know when public is

212
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,380
secret I can see that I say okay so if a

213
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,410
drone were to fly overhead and take a

214
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,240
picture of me walking outside of the

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,720
loss

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,139
what I have a innie act reasonable

217
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,389
expectation of privacy in that and my

218
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,430
students inevitably say no absolutely

219
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,970
not

220
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,459
I didn't say okay what if that same

221
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,670
drone was a sign to me and it followed

222
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,579
me everywhere I went in public to every

223
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:10,819
single state that never violated it

224
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,439
never looked inside my home it never

225
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,240
followed me inside a building that only

226
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,430
monitored my public comings and goings

227
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,180
for a solid year then with my privacy

228
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,920
have been violated and my students

229
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,889
squirm a little because they inevitably

230
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,509
want to say yes because they know that

231
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,889
they just committed to the statement

232
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,899
that there's no privacy in public but

233
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,850
there's something inherently wrong about

234
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,730
that activity versus say the snapshot

235
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,319
that came out of nowhere and so I think

236
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,209
that obscurity can it's a concept that

237
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,910
can help us ease this tension we simply

238
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,420
have a very low probability of any kind

239
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,759
of harm in most of our daily occurrences

240
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,089
we rely upon structural protections we

241
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,250
rely upon contextual protections to

242
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,399
protect us all the time and this is

243
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,899
increasingly happening online and so I

244
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,199
think it's a valued concept in the law

245
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,870
in some instances but the law does a

246
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,329
very poor job of recognizing the value

247
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,000
of obscurity and social technologies

248
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,160
because what we tend to do is fall back

249
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,009
on the password it's an easy line to

250
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,920
draw right and you've heard you've read

251
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,329
cases I'm sure and you've had

252
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,279
conversations with people that went

253
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,509
something along the lines of well they

254
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:25,759
posted it online and then there's

255
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,899
fossils that he put it behind a password

256
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,029
like yeah but okay what's private and we

257
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,579
tend to recognize the password as this

258
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,500
kind of talisman where oh well maybe

259
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,839
things were protected but there are lots

260
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,389
of things that can control access and

261
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,430
limit the probability of something being

262
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,389
found or understood besides passwords

263
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,309
and so I mean judges could do a much

264
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:48,559
better job of realizing the value of

265
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,329
context which of course gets that I'm

266
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,149
hellenism bombs theory of contextual

267
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,980
integrity privacy as contextual

268
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,800
integrity courts have somewhat

269
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,160
recognized obscurity obscurity kind of

270
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,280
has an older sibling

271
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,930
if some of you recall the case of

272
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,520
Department of Justice versus reporters

273
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,400
committee of freedom enforcement freedom

274
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,490
of the press which had to do with a FOIA

275
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,470
request for an errata sheet that

276
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,110
aggregated lots of different violations

277
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,150
through dusty old courthouses in the

278
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,600
United States and that request was

279
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,340
denied on personal privacy grounds

280
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,490
because it was seen that trying to

281
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,350
figure out whether someone committed a

282
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,050
crime in lots of different places

283
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,790
scattered throughout was very different

284
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,770
than having information aggregated all

285
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,580
in one place because the structural

286
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,960
protections in the transactional costs

287
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,360
the transactional costs were so high as

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,190
to make the likelihood that anyone to

289
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,320
find that information very low and so

290
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,150
using that I think the we can kind of

291
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,040
broaden this concept and explored a

292
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,110
little more to resolve some of the

293
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,480
tensions that we see in privacy law

294
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,780
right now so courts could do a better

295
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,880
job of recognizing it I think lawmakers

296
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,100
could do a better job of recognizing it

297
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,710
lawmakers might actually want to utilize

298
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,020
the security to justify laws that are

299
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,380
already on the books but seen as largely

300
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,910
ineffective so the driver's Privacy

301
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,250
Protection Act which many of you I'm

302
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,380
sure are very familiar with limits the

303
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,170
collection of certain kinds of

304
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,040
information and there are lots of

305
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,530
regulations and statutes that limit the

306
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,670
collection of certain kinds of

307
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,110
information and a lot of this

308
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,910
information is known by lots of

309
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,040
different people things like your home

310
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,770
address your a zip code other pieces of

311
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,170
information that it's difficult to

312
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,720
justify so I have conversations with my

313
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,400
mom all the time it's like your address

314
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,610
is in private and in the abstract it

315
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,170
probably isn't because you can be fine

316
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,490
you can find it lots of different places

317
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,210
but it could be justified as a way to

318
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,890
protect the obscurity of information by

319
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,770
making it more difficult to find or

320
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,990
understand okay so how do i define

321
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,180
obscurity at least in the online context

322
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,700
there are really four different ways one

323
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,420
is search well we use the the lock and

324
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,890
key metaphor

325
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,530
and it used to be the passwords were

326
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,150
kind of a lock and key to privacy but I

327
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,440
think there are lots of different things

328
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,560
that can make information more or less

329
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,970
obscure and so there are four factors

330
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,850
the presence of which makes information

331
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,040
less obscure and the absence of which

332
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,350
makes information more obscure so these

333
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,600
things are searched this ability can you

334
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,580
find something either at the site level

335
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,940
or at Google if not if it's dead to

336
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,140
search then it's kind of dead to the

337
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,200
world isn't at least as a general matter

338
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,580
unprotected access not just passwords

339
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,460
but encryption privacy settings

340
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,340
visibility settings I catch a lot of

341
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,990
flack for protecting my Twitter account

342
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,120
and it's only for BOTS I welcome all of

343
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280
you to follow I I'm trying to hide from

344
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,410
bots I'm trying to exert a certain

345
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,910
amount of control over basically

346
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,500
generalized public access so I decrease

347
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,570
the likelihood of people finding I'm not

348
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,460
saying it's perfectly safe but in many

349
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,440
ways I consider obscurity to be good

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,350
enough privacy identification do I use

351
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,600
some kind of a name variant if it's

352
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,150
harder to link my identity to something

353
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,310
then I've got a greater probability of

354
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,050
protection so basically what I'm trying

355
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,720
to do here is reduce the odds if I post

356
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,270
something online as Woody that's better

357
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,340
than Woodrow Hartzog but certainly less

358
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,010
good than WH and certainly less good

359
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,900
than a completely made-up pseudonym and

360
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,770
so their degrees you and finally clarity

361
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,070
we produce obscurity as individuals all

362
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,540
the time we may not even know that

363
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,910
that's what we're doing but when I log

364
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,980
on to Facebook and I say it's positive

365
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,890
and you say I have no idea what that

366
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,480
means but it only makes sense if you

367
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,650
know that my wife and I are trying to

368
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,150
conceive and you say oh great job

369
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,930
congratulations and so how can obscurity

370
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,570
be better implemented in the law I think

371
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,340
there probably three different ways so

372
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,040
the first is we could try to ease up on

373
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,080
what's been called on the public private

374
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,030
dichotomy something's I had a completely

375
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,710
private and it's completely unprotected

376
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,930
and we're gonna go about it or its

377
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,990
public and you know if you want any kind

378
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,820
of privacy protection in it too bad I

379
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,980
think we can plot information along a

380
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,350
continuum where something is either than

381
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,019
most of

382
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,050
or is the most obvious and it lets us I

383
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,600
think get a more nuanced sense of how

384
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,399
valuable this information is and how

385
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,920
protected it should be one of the things

386
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,989
that I think we could explore is having

387
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:31,879
agreements to maintain obscurity

388
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,489
confidentiality agreements are extremely

389
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:36,199
important for lots of different kinds of

390
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,029
information but there's lots of

391
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:40,249
information that we might not mind you

392
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,170
sharing with other people I just don't

393
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,029
want you to put it online we just don't

394
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,799
want you associate our name with it and

395
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,019
so why not we try to engage in a few

396
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:49,339
more agreements where you say hey buddy

397
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,319
I'll share this with you but you got a

398
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,470
promise not to make it less obscure than

399
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,209
it is right now and so don't put it

400
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:56,899
online

401
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,879
don't you know just close it behind

402
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,170
certain visibility settings don't

403
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,119
associate my name with it don't provide

404
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,499
any more information that will allow

405
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,149
others to kind of decode the meaning for

406
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,339
this and so it's a way to kind of move

407
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,649
past our conference our agreement or

408
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,600
nothing with respect to online

409
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,749
agreements and finally having that

410
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:17,600
obscurity could be a design strategy so

411
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,489
for those that are designing social

412
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:22,040
technologies we wrestle a lot with well

413
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,839
how do we completely protect people when

414
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,429
they want to disclose information to

415
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:28,549
some but not others and I think the goal

416
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:31,309
should actually be to allow users to

417
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,470
create their own obscurity because it's

418
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,179
something that we very naturally rely on

419
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,879
and it works for most kinds of

420
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,069
information I think that it's a mistake

421
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,259
to try to value information is simply

422
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,329
public or something private and so when

423
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,309
we allow users to kind of create their

424
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,319
own obscurity I think that's much more

425
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:51,110
beneficial than when trying to design

426
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,279
for maybe something else like

427
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,439
confidentiality all right so in

428
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,439
conclusion I think that obscurity is a

429
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,529
really important privacy protective

430
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,520
state that has been virtually ignored in

431
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,409
most aspects of the law and something

432
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,020
that could help ease a lot of tensions

433
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,949
and our need to disclose information to

434
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,529
some people but not to all so thank you

435
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,689
very much

436
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,750
you
