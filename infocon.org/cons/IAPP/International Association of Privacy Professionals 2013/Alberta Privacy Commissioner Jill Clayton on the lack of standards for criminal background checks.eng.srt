1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,090
Alberta actually doesn't have a great

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,879
rep for criminal background checks I

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:10,530
think there was a report was it last

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,590
year the Canadian civil liberties did a

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,389
study of criminal that was pretty sweet

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,890
release information checks yeah and

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,720
Alberta did not come out very well in

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,760
that in that study and I think that part

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,380
of the problem is that there's no

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,289
there's there are no standards in

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,170
Alberta at the moment for criminal

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,579
background checks and and what an

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,289
organization's an employer might be

14
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,199
asking for on the one hand and what they

15
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:43,289
actually need are also two very very

16
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,649
different things so you know I do know

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,819
that there's a there's a group that's

18
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:50,010
gotten together in Alberta that's

19
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,589
actually taking a look at at criminal

20
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:53,969
background checks and what information

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,649
is collected and what information is

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,059
being shared and I know that you know

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,019
Liz will have something to say about

24
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,479
this because she's done a an interesting

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,019
report on the topic I think that all I'm

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,309
going to say is it we haven't looked at

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,039
it very deeply in Alberta we get

28
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,649
occasional complaints and we've been

29
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,210
very we've been reactive to that but we

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,560
are involved with this group right now

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,770
that's trying to proactively figure out

32
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,070
how to solve some of the problems when

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,109
too much information is being shared and

34
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,520
organizations are collecting this

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,469
information with account without first

36
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,200
turning their mind to do I actually need

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,729
this information and of course once you

38
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,469
get this information that brings on a

39
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:33,270
whole other set of responsibilities what

40
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,500
are you going to do with it and how are

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,939
you going to limit access to it and how

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,320
long are you going to keep it because

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,570
it's a snapshot in time and what if you

44
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,219
ask for this information you find out

45
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,869
something that raises flags for you is a

46
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,450
DUI a problem is a break and interment

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,640
like you know it raises all sorts of

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,399
issues it's a far more complicated thing

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,009
than just we're going to as a blanket

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,200
program do criminal background checks on

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
everybody yeah it's tricky
