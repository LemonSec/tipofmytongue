1
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:12,300
good morning everybody your new

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,049
community to be unusually a tech

3
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,140
business kind of guy I've written and

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,830
spoken a lot about social media and I

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,779
have been writing a book with my

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,689
frequent colleague Robert Scoble it's

7
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,099
called the age of context and the

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,540
subtitle may change but right now it's

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,000
how it will impact your working in life

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,660
which is pretty comprehensive and we

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,600
didn't start this book with any plan to

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,640
have anything to do with privacy

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,300
whatsoever we went around as we've done

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,449
before we've talked to a lot of people

15
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,309
entrepreneurs and technologists about

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,120
this cool stuff that they're making it's

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,449
in five categories you know the

18
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,420
categories independently mobile social

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,770
media data of course location based

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,729
technologies and sensors we look at how

21
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,460
these five are converging into what we

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,790
consider a super storm and the result of

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,130
the super storm is the people in their

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,530
technology are going to have a new level

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,790
of closeness a relationship that is

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,590
different than we used to having with

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,560
machines of any kind and among the

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,070
reasons that it will be so close is your

29
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,390
devices are going to know everything

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,979
about you they're going to know you

31
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,020
healthier business your schedule your

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,600
calendar your friends what kind of email

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,829
you like first they're going to know

34
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,409
everything and based on that they're

35
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,390
going to be able to anticipate what you

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,329
want next which can get Airy as I'll

37
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,719
tell you about well we went around

38
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,500
talking to people who are making these

39
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,630
technologies we realized that there was

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,799
a freaky lying it's funny I was just

41
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,690
when I said freaky line I was reminded

42
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,600
to stay in

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,900
this line so you can see me so I

44
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,800
definitely and every time we looked at

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,330
something like what's going on in

46
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,840
retailer and health or an automotive we

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,660
found this freaky line and it involves

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,170
two powers that don't seem opposing

49
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,750
they're like Cohen centric circles I'll

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,180
get back to them later what a security

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,060
and one is privacy sometimes these two

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,430
as you know from recent events in the

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,810
news can be in conflict but before I get

54
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,760
to what I think about that let me tell

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,650
you a little bit about what we found and

56
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,620
I know you know a few of these and I'll

57
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,950
rattle them off rather quickly in retail

58
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,080
heineken and Walmart are working with an

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,800
Argentinian company called a smart

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,230
perception they created a sensor panel

61
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,800
they use American sensors called Prime

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,250
from primeSense and they go on above a

63
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,190
section and retail store so if you go

64
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,020
into the store and you're looking for

65
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,780
cereal they will know not who you are

66
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,310
they cancel your face but they'll know

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,620
what you're looking at if you reach out

68
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,800
and touch a box of curios an iPad

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,140
installed as a display on the Shelf will

70
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,510
offer you 40 percent off on the Cheerios

71
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,240
or perhaps will be a competing offer

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,730
from another serial saying instead of

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,370
cheerios tried Kellogg's k and we'll

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,850
give you thirty percent off this is one

75
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,770
thing going on in retail a whole other

76
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,720
way of looking at it is the National

77
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,870
Football League using you'll love it the

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,650
New England Patriots as the test case

79
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,020
working on contextual technologies in

80
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,030
the stadium why are they doing this

81
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,130
because they're real competition has

82
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,600
become HBO met HBO HD TV people are

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,490
staying home and watching football games

84
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,480
and they are they're going to taverns

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,608
but every year the stadium's losing

86
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,048
about two percent of their attendance

87
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,130
take

88
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,740
have always been the flagship for new

89
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,980
technologies in the working and using

90
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,240
data mobile apps and other technologies

91
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,890
so that their best customers can get

92
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,050
their beers in the dance their food and

93
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,690
advance or anything of the bling that

94
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,590
you buy at football games so these fans

95
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,420
and the best needs of course a season

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,710
pass holders and they get a little note

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,590
saying the halftime will be in five

98
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,260
minutes do you want another beer and

99
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,950
cheese tank and if they claim yes

100
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,170
there's an express line they go up there

101
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,490
they don't have to pay for it because

102
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,590
the credit card is on file as it is

103
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,560
everywhere else and so now you have a

104
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,110
contextual beer this of course will

105
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,510
spread from the Patriots to the rest of

106
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,930
the NFL other sports rock concerts and

107
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,730
everything else so everything I talked

108
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,400
about has bigger implications than the

109
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,520
little thing and mentioning we all have

110
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,350
loyalty cards and put them on our key

111
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,390
chains and in our wallets and they do

112
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,550
things but these are starting to be

113
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,130
linked up we're getting more and more

114
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,130
data so that smart loyalty cards and now

115
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,950
coming in there in trial stages but big

116
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,810
companies will be using them I would

117
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,270
guess in the next two or three years so

118
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,710
now when you walk into a payless they

119
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,600
know how often you were in here they

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,580
know you usually by when you're in here

121
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,590
they're starting to understand by a

122
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,050
sensor on the card the path you take

123
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,360
while you walk through there and as you

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,100
walk through you can start getting

125
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,340
special offers on things based on what

126
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,020
you're buying habits have been in the

127
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,660
past we think this will be in every

128
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,550
retail operation right now people call

129
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,800
it contextual marketing when you're in a

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
mall and suddenly you get 40 offers to

131
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,620
get discounts everywhere and it's just

132
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,470
another form of noise filtering is going

133
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,600
to come in so that the customization is

134
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,650
there and you're going to start seeing

135
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,740
things that maybe you want filtering is

136
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,510
important because the same technology is

137
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,910
going to be used by first responders

138
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,950
who run into a burning building and

139
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,540
don't need to know they can get ten

140
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,460
percent off on a cup of starbucks coffee

141
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,380
they do need to know other facts and

142
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,410
they will get to know them fast health

143
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,820
is one place that is just amazing of

144
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,450
what is going on there are a few

145
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,580
products that you may know I notice that

146
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,480
Trevor was wearing a Nike FuelBand Nike

147
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,890
FuelBand gives you some basic

148
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,170
information that helps people lose

149
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,140
weight stay fit but as where it's going

150
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,210
and what other technologies are also

151
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,030
doing in wearable devices deciding to

152
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,620
know every function of your body a

153
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,200
glucose level your heartbeat your your

154
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,260
galvanic the skin which basically means

155
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,700
the perspiration which shows you

156
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,620
nervousness whether you have

157
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,630
neurological health or not and other

158
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,540
such things and this is all for you for

159
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,250
your personal health except it's being

160
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,760
gathered and put in the cloud as a data

161
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,060
source where this data will be used

162
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,420
today is not in danger where will be

163
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,760
used 10 or 20 years of five years in the

164
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,770
future I don't know Jim medicine is

165
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,270
something else that we discover we never

166
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,930
heard of before it there's a clear

167
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,390
relationship between your health and

168
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,400
where do you live if you live in a coal

169
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,410
mine you're more prone for emphysema if

170
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,230
you live in the mountains cancer if you

171
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,180
live near a polluted river then the

172
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,860
drinking water you have to lead to

173
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,960
intestinal problems it's only now being

174
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,530
used not by the health industry but this

175
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,810
bottom-up movement of people who are

176
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,650
using technology for better health one

177
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,480
of the applications we came across in

178
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,610
this the area is from a company called

179
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,660
as a Midwestern company called as ma

180
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,630
palace I think I said it right yes the

181
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,059
as ma palace um application has a sensor

182
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,250
device that goes on top of an asthma

183
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,669
patient's breathing to inhaler and at

184
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,080
the same time

185
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,710
as a mobile app and a collects data on

186
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,560
where people use their inhalers in New

187
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,660
Yorker school was part of the pilot

188
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,990
program high school level and they

189
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,380
discovered that asthmatic children

190
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,850
excuse me I get all choked up when I

191
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,500
talk about asthma I don't know why um

192
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,730
asthmatic children walking to school

193
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,620
would always breathe the inhaler in the

194
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,690
same place and they discovered that

195
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,010
they're rather close to a refinery so by

196
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,900
getting the kids to reroute themselves

197
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,760
by one block they stop the kids from

198
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,010
having asthma attacks every day as they

199
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,650
walk to and from school there are many

200
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,540
other applications that are being worked

201
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,030
on we looked at cities we have a chapter

202
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,280
called the contextual cities and there's

203
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,250
a lot of stuff that's fascinating how 3d

204
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,140
modeling is creating as it has in

205
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,510
Seattle major urban projects that come

206
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,560
in on time on budget or even under this

207
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,500
is by dramatic contrast for those of you

208
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,990
from New England on something called the

209
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,580
Big Dig that was 44 years late and 55

210
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,540
billion dollars over the original budget

211
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,390
and they got away with it that leads to

212
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,600
another issue which is that there is a

213
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,000
trend that in the contextual cities we

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,460
talked about the new urbanist some of

215
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,780
you that I met last night of new

216
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,720
urbanist demographically we all left

217
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,270
home very often in the suburbs went to

218
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,980
college moved into the city for a few

219
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,140
years got a job there then get married

220
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,610
and moved back out to the suburbs but

221
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,290
this is reversing and people is staying

222
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,890
in the city they're using zipcar's

223
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,340
rather than owning cars they are

224
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,690
starting to raise families there and

225
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,950
they want better schools they want

226
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,600
better government and they want urban

227
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,920
projects that don't ruin their

228
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,610
neighborhoods and they're demanding

229
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,020
better access to government and

230
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,610
municipal level a lot of cities

231
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,250
Vancouver San Francisco New York Chicago

232
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,890
Washington of course is a forward

233
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,440
thinker in this area Chattanooga are all

234
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,350
putting more and more of city data in

235
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,620
the cloud where voters have access to it

236
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,800
and this is changing the relationship

237
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,279
between urban planners and constituents

238
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
because the urban planners are finding

239
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
it's a lot safer and better to get the

240
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,430
input in the planning phase rather than

241
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,420
after the damn thing gets built ha cars

242
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,260
cars in my favorite cars we can get to

243
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,529
the contextual car the self-driving car

244
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,760
that's technologically sooner than

245
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,370
regulators will probably allow it to be

246
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,899
but what's more interesting is this

247
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,800
thing called a data log earlier this

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,610
year John Broder a New York Times

249
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,890
reporter who often already I just got

250
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,480
here okay

251
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,350
okay thank you very much John brudder a

252
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,470
New York Times reporter who usually

253
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,540
covers the White House likes to review

254
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,440
cars and he reviewed the model asked

255
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,630
Tesla a while ago and gave it a really

256
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,940
awful review it culminated not in Boston

257
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,079
where I was supposed to but in

258
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,579
Connecticut where it had to be towed

259
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:32,040
away and for those of you who know who

260
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,029
Yvonne musk is he doesn't take this

261
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,880
stuff easily it turns out he had a data

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,070
box in the car that reviewed everything

263
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,449
that Broder did and he did a fact by

264
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,079
fact breakdown showing in his conclusion

265
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,290
that rotor had to work very very hard to

266
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,199
make the car fail so badly the New York

267
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,050
Times own buds woman wrote an op-ed page

268
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,760
basically saying this is true five years

269
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,230
earlier big business the enterprise got

270
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,350
into blogging when the vice chairman of

271
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,470
General Motors started arguing with

272
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,250
reviewers on the GM new blog called the

273
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,630
fast lane and he had to use the force of

274
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,389
his personality which use very well but

275
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,970
we've come forward in technology we're

276
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,220
now data is on the side of the defense

277
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,139
case and you can take on the New York

278
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,420
Times reviewer and prove your case

279
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,899
factually did will be used lots of ways

280
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,000
with this little data box because it now

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,490
knows who's driving by the seat position

282
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,440
and that sort of stuff what radio

283
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,449
stations you listen to it knows

284
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,389
everywhere you go and there is a record

285
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,940
of this you also have other devices in

286
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,949
this part of the country you have EZ

287
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,500
Pass where I live as fast pass but every

288
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,720
time you cross a toll but a gate there's

289
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,430
a picture taken showing where you were

290
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,420
at a certain time this data is collected

291
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,540
can this be used

292
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,440
by law enforcement and an investigation

293
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,350
not definitely but probably but can it

294
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,860
be used in a civil case when one party

295
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,570
is divorcing the other and wants to see

296
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,890
where a car was parked on a certain

297
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,120
night I'm going to wrap up so I'll go

298
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,670
right to Google glass which is something

299
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,500
that it's gotten a lot of news

300
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,090
everybody's concerned about what happens

301
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,340
when you go into a bathroom wearing them

302
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,310
well for one thing if I took a video of

303
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,110
you or a picture of you with google

304
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,070
glass it would light up it would ding

305
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,930
you would know I was taking a picture

306
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,940
for another thing i could only record

307
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,410
what's directly in front of me which an

308
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,370
arrest room would be very unwise

309
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,390
simultaneously this very little talk

310
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,890
about the fact that Google knows

311
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,290
everywhere your eye looks all the time

312
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,230
when you're wearing them so I have to go

313
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,030
to wrap up very fast and I'll rattle

314
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,860
through these quickly hopefully we'll

315
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,950
get to them in the Q&A again we have a

316
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,260
few conclusions one is this is a very

317
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,360
nuanced issue this trade-off between

318
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,840
security and privacy and I can't tell

319
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,850
you what you should do other than be

320
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,890
aware and pay attention to try to stop

321
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,290
it at this point as some people would

322
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,010
like to do is very idealistic I think

323
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,420
it's a little bit like standing on a

324
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,540
beach and trying to punch a tsunami

325
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,560
first of all you wants to see in the

326
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,550
second of all you're going to find

327
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,060
yourself in deep water we use this stuff

328
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,770
because there is this free ice cream

329
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,900
thing if you want to search on Google

330
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,820
for free that's really good stuff that's

331
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,430
free ice cream in return for that you

332
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,080
have to let Google know more about you

333
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,330
so they can give you better answers so

334
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,340
legitimate trade off but as you can

335
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,460
imagine there are many issues I think

336
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,860
Google is a very very ethical company

337
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,960
compared to other companies but the

338
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,790
people who run it now may not run it

339
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,680
five years in today at ten years from

340
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,410
today they all have nice retirement

341
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,219
packages

342
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,040
the other thing is I know many of you

343
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
talked last night my wife Paula and I

344
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,100
heard a lot about policy policy is

345
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,769
really nice and I believe it we're in

346
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,529
New Hampshire which 54 years after the

347
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,779
first seat belt laws were passed in

348
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,180
Wisconsin still doesn't require you to

349
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,060
wear seatbelts in a car they have on the

350
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,680
license plate instead live free or die

351
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,660
which i think is a real choice in this

352
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,459
stage but the point of it is technology

353
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,629
is moving at a breathtaking pace public

354
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,860
policy regulation or lawmakers don't and

355
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,899
if you try to get policy to control this

356
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,879
you need to leap forward beyond the

357
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,879
issue of should this data be collected

358
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,560
because it is being collected and it

359
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,899
isn't going to be stopped and I bet

360
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,220
right now something's going to tell me

361
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,899
to shut up and get off the stage so

362
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,829
thank you very much
