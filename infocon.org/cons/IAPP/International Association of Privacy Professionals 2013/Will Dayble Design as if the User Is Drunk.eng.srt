1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,440
howdy whoa that's loud I sound a lot

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,710
taller than I actually am um so I'm the

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,680
Aussie guy um yeah that's me I'm a

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,380
professional that's that's me

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,500
at a bush doof in Australia um we

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,750
Australians are very good with words we

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,269
take the bush and dance music which goes

8
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,590
tough tough tough when we put them

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,880
together you see what I did there

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,159
Bush stuff it's it's like a party out in

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,590
the middle of the bush with a whole

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,300
bunch of people that like drive out and

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,520
take a whole bunch of drugs and party

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,350
all weekend yeah people trust me with

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,469
their innovation it's a good idea so but

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,030
the reason that I've got this up here is

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,210
that I honestly think I have learned

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,510
more about UI and UX design and how

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,520
people work from these kinds of events

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,340
than the last decade of UI stuff I

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,160
honestly honestly there's like there's a

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,229
rugged humanity to what happens at these

23
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,299
kinds of events and I do them every

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,560
every half year or so to keep me weird

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,790
god I think I think that's important

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,759
right um by day yeah we danced so nicely

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,830
put we we do innovation for companies

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,170
that are like hyped to do innovation but

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,570
to kind of big and slow to actually do

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,799
it and obviously this involves like a

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,369
whole bunch of UI and UX stuff so whilst

32
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,250
I am completely on it undereducated on

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,409
like law and security stuff other people

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,420
deal with that you are and UX is like

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,509
this my thing right and there's this

36
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,649
there's this marvelous thing that

37
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,320
happens when you're like particularly

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,450
good at anything I think like if you do

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,399
your 10,000 hours on anything you you

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,170
see the face of God in it you know you

41
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,000
get you get totally into it and it's

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,340
like 12 hours in front of an iMac

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,979
pushing pixels around and your brain

44
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,920
melts and then you go to leave so that

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,270
you can get out into the real world and

46
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,909
you grasp the door handle and

47
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,788
neo like like oh my god I can see the

48
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,530
card thing happens and you like this is

49
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,370
bad UI I know this this is bad you are

50
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,349
if this was a lever it would be easier

51
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,750
to to open if this was like a sliding

52
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,690
door that knew who I was and let me if

53
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,879
it had like a little swipe card like my

54
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,830
hotel that would be kind of secure and I

55
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,190
could get it oh I can see the code it is

56
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,160
all UI like my feet are the interface

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,910
between like my myself in this stage for

58
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,709
the goal of like wandering around while

59
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,799
I rant yeah like you can have you can

60
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,930
have the division between like

61
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,180
accountancy and law let's say yeah like

62
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,940
that's a that's an interface I'm air and

63
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,010
water service engine interfaces yeah and

64
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,379
and there's this thing right with

65
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,299
interfaces we're really good ones after

66
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,730
you start thinking about them not just

67
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,670
as portals but that's like places for

68
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,440
somebody to get from one place to the

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,989
other or or interact with one thing or

70
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:11,579
another

71
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,859
um they kind of these start to drift

72
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,079
away and you get this kind of weird Zen

73
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,730
like maybe I've taken too many drugs at

74
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,310
parties now you get this Zen like kinda

75
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,459
great UI is not their feeling it's it's

76
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,190
porous its transparent it's this it's

77
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,959
like it's like old lovers that talk

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,459
without talking it's it's it's like like

79
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,069
a like a classical guitarist that has a

80
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,620
beautiful guitar and it is no longer

81
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,079
human the guitar it's like the guitar

82
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,569
plays him and he just opens up his heart

83
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,950
and the music comes out and that's it he

84
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,630
couldn't tell you how right because

85
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,019
guitars are brilliant bits of UI there

86
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,200
are really really well figured out PC UI

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,720
so if I don't know if UI is the guitar

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,639
if UI is the the notes in the song then

89
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,530
how can we how can we can't in textual

90
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,489
as UX in there yeah I would say that I

91
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,519
would say that UX is is the it's that

92
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,560
tap of the conductor's baton right at

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,750
the start so the things like quieten

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,519
down it's like getting the tickets in

95
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,690
the mail before you go and see the

96
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,120
concert

97
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,180
it's it's like walking walking down the

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,260
street with your friends afterwards

99
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,310
talking about the experience um like on

100
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,280
the web we like to think about branding

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,530
notice what you tell an audience you are

102
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,620
or what you do branding is is what they

103
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,139
tell their friends about you and UX is

104
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,970
the thing that they tell their friends

105
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,290
about you right so we've got a whole

106
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,490
bunch of guys in the studio and we've

107
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,990
got this issue where we get a whole

108
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,720
bunch of new employees because we're

109
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,340
growing quite quickly and I need a

110
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,440
really quick and dirty way to explain to

111
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,229
these guys how to think about UI and UX

112
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:01,040
and it's really really easy if you just

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,560
think the person on the other end of the

114
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,530
UI is drunk it works it works really

115
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,979
really really well we know that drunk

116
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,200
people are like really distractible so

117
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,389
you take them like step by step by step

118
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,550
through the idea yeah okay you're gonna

119
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,560
put on your shoes okay now you gotta get

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,660
into the taxi you've seen this kind of

121
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,270
thing right like we we we have big fat

122
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,479
childish buttons that you click yeah and

123
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,669
they've got like little bevels on them

124
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:29,660
so that you know that you can interact

125
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,520
with them we've got this oh by the way

126
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,169
it's Melbourne time it's like Friday

127
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,820
night and I'm not willing to reset my

128
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,880
clock

129
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,689
um we we we say things twice yeah this

130
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,270
is something we've stolen from speed

131
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,729
signs in Australia yeah when you are

132
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,129
driving down an Australian Road you'll

133
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:51,659
get a little thing that says 60k an hour

134
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,219
and then 50 metres later also you'll see

135
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,289
another sign that says 60 K an hour it's

136
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,520
because you missed the first one because

137
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,199
the kids are arguing in the back and you

138
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,759
see the second be like yeah okay slow

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,979
down right we say it twice we say next

140
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,210
slide and then we have a little arrow

141
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,310
pointing right you know because cuz

142
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,099
drunk people need it twice yeah there's

143
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,960
a whole bunch of a whole bunch of like

144
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,539
really simple kind of technical reasons

145
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,310
why thinking about the end user a strong

146
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,939
works really well um but we're here to

147
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,830
talk about like privacy and security

148
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,110
right are we going to talk about the

149
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,689
larger issues and I think some of the

150
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,479
the more human issues so let's see if we

151
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,419
can stretch this embarrassing metaphor a

152
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,669
little further and talk about the UX of

153
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:44,099
privacy um so sick let's start with the

154
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,529
fun stuff six okay so when you when you

155
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,020
drive to this Bush stuff right because

156
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,129
they're like that someone's farm or

157
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,689
whatever you always you can't to the

158
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:52,860
front gate and you roll down a window

159
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,360
and some dude will give you like a

160
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,550
little thing around your wrist you know

161
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,089
to prove that you've paid and you get

162
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,319
like a garbage bag to fold your rubbish

163
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,960
away and more and more these days they

164
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,699
give you a little pocket and a little

165
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,680
packet when you open it up it's got a

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,110
couple of condoms in it that says put

167
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,999
these in your back pocket and so you

168
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,620
oblige and because you're sad about

169
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,819
music you don't care about this and

170
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,740
underneath it there's another little

171
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,810
sign that says dude this party lasts all

172
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,300
weekend and it is going to be red a baby

173
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,719
lasts forever

174
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,590
so party hot but party safe right and it

175
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,990
works yeah it works really really well

176
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,090
and I think like part of the reason why

177
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,700
is because condoms are again brilliant

178
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,650
UI right there's like a standard little

179
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,960
pocket with blooper you can like use it

180
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,000
one-handed to pull the packet of heart

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,640
you know it's like if the UX around it

182
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,850
is really good you know like we get that

183
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,680
we get that thing at 14 where we all sit

184
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,390
in an embarrassing class in high school

185
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,010
that when you put the condoms of bananas

186
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,660
you know there's like we have billboards

187
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,310
in Melbourne telling men to check out

188
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,900
their sexual health it works because

189
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,970
it's like a multilateral approach to

190
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,940
safety and a drunk person can use a

191
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,710
condom you know it works okay so another

192
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,150
thing about about drunk people it's

193
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,100
that's concentrate on the drugs um so

194
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,140
have you uh have you ever noticed that

195
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,300
thing where a party's the more people

196
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,580
get drunk the more they share about

197
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,620
themselves we'd love to share with

198
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,780
societal beings you know we share

199
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,270
everything um I got his friend who has a

200
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,720
beautiful trick for getting people to

201
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,909
interact better at parties right because

202
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,010
she's a really good hostess and what she

203
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,780
does is she sits all the strangers in a

204
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,700
circle together and gets them all a shot

205
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,580
of tequila and and the idea is that you

206
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,710
take the shot and then you explain

207
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,170
quickly your most embarrassing sexual

208
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,800
misadventure and you know everyone in

209
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,660
the group is like no I'm not gonna say

210
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,430
that I'm drunk but not that drunk

211
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,890
right but she stalks off she takes two

212
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,300
shots just to make a point and then she

213
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,630
tells this story about or like double

214
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,920
denim and country music and I'm pretty

215
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,270
sure I'm being filmed so I'm not gonna

216
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,150
repeat it but the point is that she

217
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,000
shares and because she's shared the

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,410
person to the left chairs and chairs and

219
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,940
chairs and chairs and before you know it

220
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,550
we've got this this group of people in

221
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,720
this web of trust

222
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,550
sharing stuff with each other because we

223
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,710
expect what happens in Vegas to stay in

224
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,100
Vegas and the idea of somebody the next

225
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,660
day going and telling somebody else

226
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,150
about it is is unheard of right we trust

227
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,020
each other because we've shared

228
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,060
something together it's it's so similar

229
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,760
to the way that people share

230
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,040
online we share our our personal hopes

231
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,540
and dreams on Twitter and Facebook

232
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,250
you've seen the way that 16 year olds

233
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,590
use this stuff right it's terrifying

234
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,510
um there's like there's a whole bunch of

235
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,520
stuff that we do online that is really

236
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,500
similar to stuff that we do when we're

237
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
drunk you know it's it's that guy the

238
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,950
same no I don't smoke I'm just drinking

239
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,820
right now I'm not a smoker and and next

240
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,170
morning like 9 a.m. you give them a

241
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,420
cigarette they are not gonna want it

242
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,730
right it's it's I actually think it's

243
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,580
kind of beautiful right because there's

244
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,140
those lovers that would never meet if

245
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,610
they like haven't have had a bit of

246
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,220
Dutch courage and said how they felt to

247
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,140
one level you've got like you see it you

248
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,310
see it on like the reddit comment

249
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,590
threads you know like those those two

250
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,060
neck beards having a beautiful like

251
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,770
incisive interesting conversation that

252
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,810
would never happen in real life if they

253
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,860
were sober because they'd have to make

254
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,940
eye contact

255
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,730
I wouldn't it wouldn't happen right and

256
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,010
the reason that this works like the

257
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,710
reason this works is because cuz UX

258
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,580
design wins right it it just wins if the

259
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,620
UX design is bad don't work I don't care

260
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,720
how beautiful the technology stack is

261
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,060
how how politically and I don't care

262
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,040
right it doesn't work UX design wins

263
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
right like I've gotta say as soon as I

264
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,720
get my hands anywhere near one of these

265
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,110
bad boys

266
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,080
I don't like staple it to my forehead

267
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,760
and just run around like a man I don't

268
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,130
care if they're tracking where I pee

269
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,460
day-to-day or like sampling my blood and

270
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,110
like taking pictures of my pupils to

271
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,160
make sure I'm bi I don't care I know the

272
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,449
Germans are liking me right now

273
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,940
but it's true it's true do you know what

274
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,770
actually I'm Siri I'm can you remind me

275
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,270
tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. to look into how

276
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,830
absolutely invasive your privacy policy

277
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:36,160
is Thank You Siri nice nice I love you

278
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,540
too bye um the reason is that these

279
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,040
things work because they're easy right

280
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,630
they work because they work on the level

281
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,540
that makes us happy right UX Trump's all

282
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,839
and I think it's one of these things

283
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,290
where I don't know it's it's it's the

284
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,140
case where if you do really good UX it's

285
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,930
not actually about like the interface or

286
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,420
it's not really about the the the method

287
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,399
that used for for dealing with the human

288
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
beings behind it it's it's how you

289
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,330
respect what people want to achieve with

290
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,810
it yeah if you have one of these like

291
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,140
our young

292
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,560
if you have one of these situations

293
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,040
where you've gotten a whole bunch of

294
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,010
good user interfaces that don't respect

295
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,660
the wishes of the person at the other

296
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,350
end it doesn't work let me let me bring

297
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,440
us back to reality again in a more

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,240
intense and interesting way so there's

299
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,100
this really interesting bit of

300
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,050
technology that was made I think was

301
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,190
embedded by an Aussie actually it's

302
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,350
called the LifeStraw and it's a little

303
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,930
like a bit of plastic thing about this

304
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,970
long and the idea is the kind around

305
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,339
your neck and you can go to like any

306
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,810
water any you doesn't matter how dirty

307
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,320
it is

308
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,180
stick it in suck in the other end and it

309
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,430
filters like 99 point something percent

310
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,670
of the impurities out it's technically

311
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,040
phenomenal it is utterly and incredibly

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,080
decisively brilliant apart from the bit

313
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,279
where it doesn't work um like yeah it

314
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,650
filters water sweet but I mean never

315
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,900
mind that the price point is like a

316
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,580
fatherhood of the yearly wage of the

317
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,320
people it's meant to be used by never

318
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,660
mind the fact that are the people that

319
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,920
are actually given it don't know how to

320
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,810
bloody use the thing right like they

321
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,370
come back and find out who's using it

322
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,720
six months later and half of them

323
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,010
haven't been taught the other ones that

324
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,960
have been taught don't even care they're

325
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,920
not going to give the most valuable

326
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,300
thing in their house to the kid to walk

327
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,160
down the street with never mind the fact

328
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,690
that no self-respecting human being is

329
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,130
gonna put their face this far away from

330
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,839
a dirty thing of water and suck on a

331
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,430
straw for 20 minutes it doesn't bloody

332
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,790
work

333
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,510
and when you have to suck for 20 minutes

334
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,670
to get your daily water intake because

335
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,670
it's a bloody desert and they need three

336
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,140
times the water of the people that

337
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,940
invented the device you it's a

338
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,780
no-brainer that it doesn't work right

339
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,370
but that there are there are some

340
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,450
solutions that are solving these

341
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:08,930
problems

342
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,040
um and the solutions that work are ones

343
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,800
that have simple transparent interfaces

344
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,200
that are built with respect for the

345
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,330
person that's using them on their terms

346
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,000
using their materials in ways that make

347
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,040
them feel like they've got ownership for

348
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,080
the device um a lot of the solutions to

349
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,580
these problems are really data-driven

350
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,560
you know you've got these like impact

351
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,510
philanthropy they look like startups

352
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,860
operating in the charity world and they

353
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,840
are kicking ass like they are really

354
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,850
really good because they build the

355
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,690
entire UI and UX around the people

356
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,790
they're gonna use it now I guess I guess

357
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,340
if that was the build then this is the

358
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,530
drop um I'm not actually talking about

359
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,750
drunk people through this entire thing

360
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,610
I'm guessing you might have noticed that

361
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,110
by now um I mean the fact is take take

362
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,570
the the 45 year old kick our CEO and

363
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,640
she's got like two degrees under a belt

364
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,950
and an MBA and a hundred people that

365
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,560
report to her and she's dealing with

366
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,900
problems that haven't been invented yet

367
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,360
and she's got the kids that need to be

368
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,010
taken to soccer tonight and she's got

369
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,930
the parents coming over on the weekend

370
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,700
and she's not entirely sure whether it's

371
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,410
her turn or her partner's turn to cook

372
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,400
dinner tonight in with the amount of

373
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,350
time she's got left to look at her

374
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,980
device she might as well be blind drunk

375
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,360
she might as well be blind drugged I

376
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,640
mean there's we've got professors here

377
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,630
they're gonna back me up on this one

378
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,220
rightly you have like a little blinking

379
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,320
male thing at the bottom of someone's

380
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
screen you just wipe like ten points off

381
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,670
their IQ so imagine imagine flinging

382
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,060
life at somebody and then expecting them

383
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,850
to understand an interface and on your

384
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,620
terms

385
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,900
it just doesn't work I mean as a UX

386
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,640
person who cares deeply about this stuff

387
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,960
I don't really care if you're dealing

388
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,830
with like a 22 year old you know San

389
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,170
Francisco hipster in Starbucks on his

390
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,160
MacBook or or it could be that 45 year

391
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,140
old blackberry user or it could be the

392
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,180
the two million proud people of West

393
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,830
Rhonda the the u.s. is the beat that

394
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,690
counts and I can I feel like like you

395
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,970
champions of industry that we have here

396
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,570
today you guys are uniquely placed to

397
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,400
make the kinds of decisions that that

398
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,480
let us reach reach through that reach

399
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,420
through the UI and talk to somebody in

400
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,250
their terms and touch their heart and

401
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,720
let them change something that's that's

402
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,430
really exciting it doesn't matter

403
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,330
whether it's like an iPhone or you're

404
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,160
dealing with like a language interface

405
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,850
or you're dealing with I don't know some

406
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,770
kind of big neural network II thing that

407
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,750
people who are interfacing with at some

408
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,890
point or another it doesn't matter if

409
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,930
it's like a physical device or a

410
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,059
technological device or or a glass of

411
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,650
water IDEs this is good I said glass of

412
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,730
water and the Germans are like you lie

413
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,640
um I mean come on it's like 11 o'clock

414
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,429
in the morning I'm not gonna drink gene

415
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:20,439
are you mental I got like a panel to

416
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,720
speaker and I'm so jet-lagged right now

417
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,730
I'm not entirely sure who I am I'm not

418
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,740
gonna throw alcohol into the mix um but

419
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,050
I know the Germans have a point the

420
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,970
Germans have a point here right there

421
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,220
that's a valid experience

422
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,559
no it's valid it's volatile II valid I

423
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,990
mean at no point did I say that that was

424
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,420
alcohol but no point did I mention the

425
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,240
word martini or or gin I'm hoping the

426
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,420
video will back me up on that but

427
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,210
they're seeing this like pink shirted

428
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,620
slightly mental guy that habitually

429
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,950
dresses up in Pikachu outfits talking

430
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,480
about sex and drugs and rock'n'roll you

431
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,890
can you can imagine how that's the

432
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,700
understanding that they'd have right I

433
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,179
guess like when this the secret is out

434
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:17,630
and the the UX is found to be wrong

435
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,600
by one party then the entire content of

436
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,520
the situation come you're listening to

437
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,040
this NSA the secure the the secret is

438
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,260
out and and the experience has been

439
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,270
compromised and as a result the entire

440
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,360
content of the thing comes into question

441
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,540
hmm

442
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,670
anyway anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna finish

443
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,330
up I'm sorry what can i as a humble UX

444
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,340
developer actually teach you am i

445
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,580
recommending that Monday kind of

446
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,590
mid-afternoon you take the project that

447
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,000
you're working on right now and have

448
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,880
like a couple of sneaky scotches and see

449
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,370
if it cuts the mustard I'm absolutely

450
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,580
not that's a that's a terrible idea and

451
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,929
I wouldn't recommend it and I don't tell

452
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,360
any of my staff to do that ever really

453
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,350
really bad idea

454
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,540
um maybe maybe the important thing we

455
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,850
should do is the Germans and I will go

456
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,150
after this and have a pint of bit burger

457
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,470
and get a little bit drunken a little

458
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,030
bit excited and start the conversation

459
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,760
again on human terms

460
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,390
okay sorry there we go will drink the B

461
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,510
you want how's that I'm gonna get out of

462
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,260
your hair thanks guys

463
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,050
you
