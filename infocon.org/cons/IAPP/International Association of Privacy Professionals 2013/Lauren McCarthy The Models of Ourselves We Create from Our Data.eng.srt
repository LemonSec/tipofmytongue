1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,240
hi

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,639
um our personal data is deeply related

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,840
to our identity

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,400
it describes us it reveals insights into

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
our lives and personalities but it also

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
shapes us

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,640
the systems and structures we build and

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,760
use for gathering

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
storing and interacting with our data

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
define the way we think about ourselves

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
the models of ourselves that we create

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
with this data determine the actions

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,599
that we take

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,760
so i was curious about this idea of

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
collecting data from our behaviors in

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
the situations that we're in

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,440
and using it to provide feedback and

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
behavior modification

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,680
that would enable us to fit in better in

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:59,840
those situations

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
is

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
so

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
uh

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
um so this is one of a series of three

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
wearables that i made for myself

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,399
um another was an anti-david streaming

27
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,920
device that could tell if i was

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
talking to someone and then vibrate at

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
the back of the neck to make me pay

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
attention and the third

31
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,160
was something that would detect how long

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,598
it had been since i touched someone and

33
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
if it was too long it would start to

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
kind of fade out the audio so in order

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,239
to talk to anyone i had to reach out and

36
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,440
touch them

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
um and they were all designed around

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
things i felt like i needed to do better

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
to fit in

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
but it was also meant to ask the

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
question what is fitting in what are

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
these optimal behaviors that we're

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
trying to achieve

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,319
you know there's been a lot of research

45
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
specifically specifically looking at

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,319
helping people with autism spectrum

47
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,480
uh disorders to fit in better with those

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
around them but in creating these

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,280
technology

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
technologies i think we need to keep

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
asking how do we set these goals

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
what is this acceptable normal that

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
we're trying to achieve

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,160
so this uh that wearable series was

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
about me reflecting on what i needed to

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,040
do

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
and having a machine help me get there

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
but i was interested in this possibility

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
of letting others provide the feedback

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
and so this what you're

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,159
seeing is a table where four people

62
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,200
could sit around it

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
and then based on how much they were

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,319
enjoying the conversation they each

65
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
person had a little foot pedal that they

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
could kind of move from minus to plus

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,239
to get feedback and then as they move

68
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
the pedal

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
it would aggregate all of the responses

70
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
and then the tabletop would

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,720
dim or brighten accordingly to give the

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,159
person that was talking some feedback of

73
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,040
whether they're going the right

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,840
direction or not

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
so we see these kinds of feedback

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
systems everywhere in social media

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
via twitter facebook instagram

78
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,680
etc you can share your personal

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
experiences emotions and opinions

80
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
and friends and strangers alike can like

81
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
that thing that you said

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,400
they can favorite your experience

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
and if they really approve of your

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
utterances and other data that you share

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
they'll start following you and they'll

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
stop following you when they start to

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,680
disapprove

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,959
but how does it feel to give this

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,400
feedback when you're face to face and

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,239
you can see the reaction

91
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
does the feedback always encourage

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
conformity or could it be a tool to

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
challenge us

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
and challenge each other and push our

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
relationships further into more

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
interesting directions

97
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,439
so i've been really curious lately about

98
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
this trend to track all of our personal

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,680
data

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,040
there are apps to measure our sleep

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
cycles our brain waves the calories we

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
consume the cigarettes we smoke the

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,839
steps we walk

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,479
you get the point and i was curious

105
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,000
about using this biometric data

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
to quantify and analyze our social

107
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
relationships so the project that i'm

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,600
working on right now

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
measures your galvanic skin response and

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
heart rate and body temperature

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
as you're hanging out with people and

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
then

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
over the span of time it starts to

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,320
associate

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,639
your emotional and physical reactions

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
with the people that you're around

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
so that just like those apps that show

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,479
you which activities are burning

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,919
calories this one will show you which

120
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,600
friends are stressing you out or making

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
you excited

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
and then you it could even um suggest

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,040
behaviors you know drop this friend

124
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
ignore their calls or invite them to

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,359
hang out

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
um so on one hand this is a dystopian

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
is this is kind of a view of a dystopian

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
future where fat we could be fast

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,080
approaching

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
where we're totally unable to manage our

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
social relationships without the help of

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
a computer

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,000
but what if it turns out that this

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
really does help

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
that we're able to form more meaningful

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
and honest connections and spend time

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,560
with those that really make us feel good

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,000
and become more aware of the effects

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,919
that we have on each other

140
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
and then there's the question that when

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,479
you're collecting data about your

142
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
interactions with other people

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
do you own that is it yours to share

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
so rather than just visualizing the

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,919
feedback what if we could receive

146
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,960
prompts or alternatives

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,520
hey how's it going uh

148
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,800
it's okay um it's okay

149
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
you yeah um see i've

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,440
been better um you know i know what we

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,840
need here

152
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,400
don't suffer through another awkward

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
date let the conversa cube fast track

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,199
your love life

155
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
new travel version can go everywhere you

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
need to be

157
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
i like you i like you too

158
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
okay i

159
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
so again this is part you know dystopian

160
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
look at the future but the thing that

161
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,199
was interesting for me about this was

162
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,759
that

163
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
in practice this device didn't give you

164
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
such kind of cheesy

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
props like that but it would sort of

166
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
look at the audio levels and then try to

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,599
give you words that would sort of

168
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
disrupt the conversation

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
and give you an opportunity to take it

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
in a different direction

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
and the response that i got was that

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
people really felt this kind of freedom

173
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
suddenly just based on this

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,680
hunk of plastic in the middle of their

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,960
table with some electronics

176
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,479
so this was about using a machine to

177
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,680
give you some prompts but i was

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,880
interested in bringing others into the

179
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
process so this was a piece that i did

180
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
where for one month i let others on the

181
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
internet control my life so it was

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,000
basically like a website

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,680
that you go to and you could edit

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,599
wikipedia style um

185
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,840
so you just go in and type in any lines

186
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
or stage directions or actions or

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
things that you wanted me to do for for

188
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,440
the next day

189
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
you could write yourself into the script

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
you could tell give me actions to do

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,440
and then at the end of the day the

192
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,879
script would close and i would perform

193
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,240
exactly what was there

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
it was mostly like my daily life so this

195
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
went on for a month

196
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
every day and

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,879
i think it was interesting the reactions

198
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
that people had a lot of people had fun

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
with this they could

200
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
make me do whatever silly thing they

201
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
wanted and see me do it

202
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,160
but others felt sort of this obligation

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
or guilt because they were my professors

204
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
or my friends and they wanted to help

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,520
but they

206
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,919
felt uneasy about the amount of control

207
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,960
that they had

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
and then others felt kind of upset and

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
angry that i was sharing so much and so

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
publicly and then implicating them

211
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
through their interactions

212
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
so you know there was there was this

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
experience for other people

214
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
uh give contributing but it was really

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,080
an experience for me and i was

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
interested in this idea of kind of

217
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,320
breaking down this narrow view of myself

218
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,799
and

219
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,240
pushing me outside the boundaries of

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
what that normally is

221
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,360
um there's this kind of like freedom

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,599
that i felt when this

223
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,919
one actually did this piece and i wanted

224
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:55,839
others to feel it too

225
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
so

226
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
um so if it wasn't clear uh you know i

227
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,519
feel like a lot of social media

228
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,519
sometimes kind of shapes and narrows the

229
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,959
ways that we interact and so i was

230
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
interested in this idea of creating a

231
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
thin layer on top of normal social space

232
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
that would let people that wanted to

233
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,880
interact in ways that that they wanted

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
to

235
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
you know asking this question can we

236
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
create alternative social spaces

237
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,000
invisible to normal society that allow

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,519
us to have their freedom to act out our

239
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,200
personal desires

240
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
and can we do this in physical space and

241
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
how do you appropriate existing systems

242
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
for use in ways that feel empowering and

243
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
free

244
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
so going back slightly to this idea of

245
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
the conversa cube and the script

246
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
what if we could really crowdsource our

247
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
social relationships and receive

248
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
real-time instructions

249
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
unbeknownst to those we're interacting

250
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
with

251
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
so

252
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
do

253
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
so in this case rather than it being

254
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
people i knew these were all anonymous

255
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,959
workers and i wanted to see if these

256
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,480
objective observers might have more

257
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
insights than i did

258
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,480
wrapped up in my own headspace and i was

259
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
also curious about how does it feel for

260
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
for an amazon turk worker going to the

261
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,160
website and expecting to do something

262
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,839
almost like a robot and then being asked

263
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,680
to do something really human

264
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,839
um you know and this is this the future

265
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,440
of google glass

266
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,279
so i think in conclusion opening your

267
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,880
private life

268
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
to the crowd to machines to the public

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
can be really freeing it can deepen your

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
connections and expand

271
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
your understanding of yourself but i

272
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,120
think it's also important to remember

273
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
that sharing your personal life

274
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
does not involve just you it affects

275
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
others you're productive relationships

276
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,360
and interactions with others and

277
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
in giving up your own privacy you're

278
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
giving up someone else's privacy too

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
when you put something private out in

280
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,279
public you no longer have full control

281
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,160
of it

282
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,440
others will encounter it and have to

283
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
deal with it and it

284
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,200
whether they've decided to or agreed to

285
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,279
or not and you're breaking down this

286
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,959
line between yourself and others which

287
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,920
can be great

288
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,079
but it affects everybody involved for

289
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,279
better or worse

290
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,839
thanks
