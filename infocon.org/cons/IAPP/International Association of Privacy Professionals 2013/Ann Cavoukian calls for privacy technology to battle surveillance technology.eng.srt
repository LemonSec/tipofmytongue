1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,850
when you think of Google glass it's

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,950
someone wearing glasses that has the

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,349
capacity to take your picture perhaps

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,150
videotape without your knowledge or

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,329
consent to that I say what I want to see

6
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,160
and I want any techies out there to give

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,230
me this I want a technology that would

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,109
enable me to put on the equivalent of

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,660
privacy glasses that would in effect

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,570
block the transmission or the

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,640
interception by Google glass or any

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,759
other wearable device of my facial image

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,740
and think of Star Trek think of force

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,629
fields that's what I want to develop so

15
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,399
that people have a response to this and

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,289
be able to say no because they're not

17
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,960
going to know who's doing it where so we

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,520
need to respond to technology with

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,230
technology we need to get smart about

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,589
this
