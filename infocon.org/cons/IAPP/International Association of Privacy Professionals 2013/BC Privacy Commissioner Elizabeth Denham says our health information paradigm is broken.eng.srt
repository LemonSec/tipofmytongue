1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,790
I actually think that we've got a lot

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,120
more challenges than whether or not we

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,070
absolutely have control over our health

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,309
data I think that the current paradigm

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,980
of personal information protection and

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,050
standalone health information is broken

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,660
just going to put that out there I think

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,460
that we're really going to have to

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,189
examine our Health Information

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,970
legislation to deal with IT challenges

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,260
of EHRs to deal with tissue banks and

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,320
genomics to be able to deal with the

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,810
fact that individuals are more more

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,790
often than not now custodians of their

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,070
own health information so I think all of

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,950
these issues will shift and I don't

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,140
think that even the newest standalone

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,290
Health Information legislation is

19
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,480
adapting or can actually deal with this

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,660
new environment bigger challenges to

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,829
come so you want to see more legislation

22
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,899
no I want to see more flexibility in the

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,880
legislation and I really don't think

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,430
that the challenge is right in front of

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,470
us are dealt with adequately in our

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,060
legislative framework that we have now
