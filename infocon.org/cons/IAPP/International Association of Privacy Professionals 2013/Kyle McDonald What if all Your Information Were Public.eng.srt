00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,840
hi everyone my name is Kyle and I'm an

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,269
artist I've only been working with these

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,910
themes for maybe three or four years now

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,789
but I got started in early two thousand

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,590
nine when i read a blog post from a

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,949
friend dan paluska called thoughts on

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,010
total openness of information and he

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,660
wrote what if all your private

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,910
information was public just the

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,549
information not the control this means

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,170
your bakes your bank statements are

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,760
public but not the bank password for

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,739
transferring funds is it possible that

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,030
your information is better off in the

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,620
hands of the general public than it is

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,239
in the hands of our large fallible

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,489
institutions if everyone has your

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,050
information does that make it less prone

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,629
to theft do enough people care to make

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,280
it repair itself the way Wikipedia

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,770
repairs itself the society function

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,270
better if we actually know the truth

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,550
about each other if all the bad people

24
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,289
have your info well you have your

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,840
identity stolen but if everyone already

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,710
knows your info how can it be stolen

27
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,720
this really got me thinking he's kind of

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,549
a philosopher and an artist and that

29
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,280
engineer so he's tying a lot of

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,210
different themes together and I think

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,430
he's not just like mindlessly accepting

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,140
the possibility of a surveillance state

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,900
he's actually asking us to ask ourselves

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,810
are there any social benefits to

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,520
openness that maybe we hadn't considered

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,790
is there some way of owning this so I

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,259
decided to answer these questions for

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,020
myself with a project called key tweeter

39
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,280
that I started right after I read this

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
post for one year i posted everything i

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,740
type directly to twitter every hundred

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,509
40th character i entered on my laptop

43
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,390
was instantly posted as a tweet and this

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,240
included emails to friends skype

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,759
conversations with my parents my entire

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,560
master's thesis waking up and going to

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,509
bed with my girlfriend everything and it

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,790
did not include any passwords or credit

49
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,700
card numbers or social security numbers

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,659
that's because I started to realize

51
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,909
there was this difference between

52
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,350
information and that sort of general

53
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,419
sense and control information or control

54
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,910
of information that one of these things

55
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,879
is kind of about who you are or who

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,890
you've been and the other thing is more

57
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,840
about who you're becoming or who you

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,819
might become or having control over your

59
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,269
identity and I wasn't so interested at

60
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,580
this point yet and letting people become

61
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,790
me yeah so one of the things i learned

62
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,000
from this project is that I don't know

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
there's there's normally this freedom

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,510
that's associated with anonymity like if

65
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,220
you're more anonymous then you have more

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,170
freedom but I found a different freedom

67
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,510
from this project which was the freedom

68
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,700
of kind of being honest with people i

69
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,220
found that knowing that everything I was

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,140
doing was posted completely in public I

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,000
didn't have any secrets to hide there

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,590
were no games to play with people I

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,630
didn't have to figure out like I keep

74
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,329
track of what I'd said to whom I could

75
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,549
just kind of be myself and be okay with

76
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,489
that but I I'm not really espousing this

77
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:06,900
idea of like oh you should have one

78
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,250
identity you know you should have this

79
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,510
consistent thing that doesn't change

80
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,790
because over that year like I changed a

81
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,980
lot like from the beginning to the end a

82
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,130
lot of beliefs i had chant changed a lot

83
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,480
of things I'd working was working on

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,579
change my friends had changed my

85
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:28,470
girlfriend had changed and you know so I

86
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,410
I guess why I'm saying more is like

87
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,420
maybe there's a different kind of

88
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,819
freedom and openness that then the

89
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,120
freedom that we associate with anonymity

90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,290
maybe there's a place both for anonymity

91
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,049
and for openness after finishing Keith

92
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,900
waiter I got really interested in some

93
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,690
ideas around sorry some of some other

94
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,970
ways of approaching sharing our openness

95
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,470
of kind of what was happening in my

96
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,450
short private personal digital life I

97
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,950
started thinking about visual

98
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,079
corollaries like tearing away bits of my

99
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,030
screen as I was using it so whenever my

100
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,889
mouse moved over something then it would

101
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,049
tear away a slice and kind of scrapbook

102
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,200
it and post it online or whenever I

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,459
whoops whenever I clicked on something

104
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,720
advanced you for there we go whenever I

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,550
click on something

106
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,548
it would store a 32 by 32 pixel icon of

107
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,230
what I'd clicked on and I could see over

108
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,760
the course of the day you know a little

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,890
bit of itunes a little bit of YouTube a

110
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,420
little bit of answering emails and

111
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,480
writing code and I was posting these

112
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,130
with friends and I'm still working on an

113
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,510
app that allows people to see what

114
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,070
everyone else is clicking on at the same

115
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,580
time after that I worked with a friend

116
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,140
Thea Watson on a project called happy

117
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,210
things where it was just a screenshot

118
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,280
directly of your screen with you kind of

119
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,080
composited in the corner but the screen

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,310
shot was taken and posted online

121
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,260
whenever you would smile so whenever you

122
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,520
smile this something on your screen it

123
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,870
would automatically post it and we got

124
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,660
everything from you know cat photos to

125
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,290
animated gifts one guy just smiled at

126
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,150
the knick Wikipedia page from Nicolas

127
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,330
Cage I think it's pretty funny too so

128
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,960
but the most helpful thing I discovered

129
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,350
was actually in this time lapse of

130
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,790
myself actually turning it around

131
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,170
instead of looking at the screen just

132
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,570
looking at myself with the webcam I took

133
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,710
a photo every minute and i was expecting

134
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,419
that maybe there would be something

135
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,370
about my face that was revealing my

136
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,900
interactions with other people that

137
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,520
would kind of do the same thing that key

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,840
tweeter had done that would reveal

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,210
something about the way that i was i was

140
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,650
working with people or that way i was

141
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,270
using technology the way technology was

142
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,220
mediating my interactions but what

143
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,690
happened instead as i noticed i just

144
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,250
always have this face like it's like

145
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,700
this computer face this blank stare and

146
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,140
it and it's there throughout the whole

147
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,790
day i think one of these photos i'm

148
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,600
smiling kind of but this really freaked

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,580
me out i thought it is this really like

150
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,560
what technology is doing to me is this

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,630
like is this was happening on the other

152
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,880
side of the screen I thought well what I

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,410
should do is I should go do some

154
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,570
research and find out if other people

155
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,250
have this face or not so I went to the

156
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,590
apple store in Manhattan tried to find a

157
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,120
nice public space to take some photos

158
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
which happens to be legal as was

159
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,790
discussed earlier

160
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,880
and I found out it's the exact same

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
situation for everyone else I

162
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,940
automatically posted thousands of photos

163
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,930
tumblr over the period of a few days and

164
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,130
everyone's wearing the same face we're

165
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,130
all looking at computers the same way

166
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,690
but Apple didn't really feel the same

167
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,900
way about this as I did and a few days

168
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,210
after posting the video kind of wrapping

169
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,680
up the project I got a visit from the

170
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
Secret Service at 8am and they executed

171
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,410
a search for it confiscating my laptop

172
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,330
and anyway so I moved on to the next

173
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,080
project I've been exploring a lot of

174
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,390
things with face tracking for maybe a

175
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,550
year up to that point so I started

176
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,130
working as just as they confiscated my

177
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,570
laptop I started working with a friend

178
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,600
Arturo Castro on this idea called face

179
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,160
substitution where we were replacing

180
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,380
people's faces in real time I was one of

181
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,760
the reasons we were interested in this

182
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,560
is just as really cool looking effect it

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,510
was like really surreal this your face

184
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,400
substituted in real time with all your

185
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,690
expressions and movement and motion and

186
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,280
we were just kind of psyched for this

187
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,560
crazy effect that we were getting but

188
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,330
the more that we played with it we

189
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,920
started to see these reference kind of

190
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,410
back to these other themes of privacy

191
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,450
and surveillance we started implementing

192
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,250
this idea from philip k dick called the

193
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,800
scramble suit which is this replacement

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,660
that's a composite of lots of different

195
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,490
people simultaneously so you get the

196
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,720
impression of talking to someone without

197
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,820
actually knowing who you're talking to

198
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,150
but my favorite project was from this

199
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,600
student keith la fuente at CMU I posted

200
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,250
all the archer oh and I we posted all

201
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,560
the code for face substitution online so

202
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,030
anyone could kind of take this technique

203
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,000
and appropriate it and reinvent you know

204
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
how they wanted face tracking to be used

205
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,330
for themselves with their own creative

206
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,020
projects and Keith did this really great

207
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,080
project called mark and Emily where he

208
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,550
takes on both the roles of mark and

209
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,940
Emily generic and normal couple

210
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,400
maintaining a long distance relationship

211
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,930
over Skype and he said the work was

212
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,370
inspired by a conversation with his

213
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,170
mother who encouraged him to continue

214
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,100
abiding by a heteronormative

215
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,690
standards even after coming out to her

216
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,340
and so he sees that it has a critique of

217
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,130
the limitations of heteronormative and

218
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,289
he's using this technology to like you

219
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,270
know replace his face and give him this

220
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,010
kind of mixed identity that allows him

221
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,539
to address something that's very

222
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,360
personal to him but also kind of this

223
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,610
like interesting cultural and political

224
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,610
thing and this is like the way that he

225
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,860
wants to use face tracking in the way he

226
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,690
wants to use these technologies that are

227
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,920
normally associated with surveillance

228
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,900
and have privacy concerns for the rest

229
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,250
of us yeah and it's especially

230
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,410
interesting to see Keith doing this were

231
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,970
coming from CMU I think this was about a

232
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,100
year and a half or two years ago because

233
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,990
it's one of the CMU's one of the places

234
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,660
where some of the most important face

235
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,510
tracking research has been done recently

236
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,240
Alessandro acquisti did this wonderful

237
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,370
project where he determines that by

238
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,470
taking photos you in a public space he

239
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,610
could cross correlate that to

240
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,540
information taken from public digital

241
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,220
information and determine your social

242
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,100
security number so I'm just curious

243
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,230
actually who knows this research anybody

244
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,150
here all right cool that's the most I've

245
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,450
seen in any crowd that was almost half

246
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,620
the audience yeah and this I don't think

247
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,600
most people realize like how direct this

248
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,300
connection is but this is like the other

249
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,070
end of the spectrum of you know we have

250
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,720
some artists on one and hacking on

251
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,060
possible creative applications of face

252
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,700
tracking and then we have a kind of

253
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,770
security researchers on the other end or

254
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,810
computer vision researchers hacking on

255
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,540
on this approach and we don't see this

256
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,570
kind of technology very often in public

257
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,050
spaces or we don't maybe just know maybe

258
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,370
we don't know the capabilities of this

259
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,290
technology you know it's not super

260
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,140
obvious like we know with the more

261
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,780
digitally oriented stuff like people are

262
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,520
doing prism or the more like physically

263
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,530
oriented stuff like trapwire it's not

264
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,970
always obvious like what the exact

265
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,320
capabilities are they're kind of

266
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,880
sometimes they're hidden in secret

267
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,070
documents and sometimes they're you know

268
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,260
leaked and but there are some things

269
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,390
that happen in public spaces like seen

270
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,220
tap has been used for a few years now

271
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,279
too

272
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,589
figure out you know who who is going to

273
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:36,790
the bars what is the makeup of the

274
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,680
people in this bar you can check in

275
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,629
advance to find out you know is this

276
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:44,050
going to be a good scene or not I don't

277
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,819
know like wow it's I think we need

278
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:47,410
artists to kind of engage with these

279
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,399
technologies and figure out not just the

280
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,019
security researchers also we need some

281
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:53,889
artists to engage with these

282
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,329
technologies and figure out how to

283
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:56,980
respond to them maybe the right way is

284
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,519
like you know thinking about your like

285
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,920
your identity as a queer person related

286
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,749
to these technologies or maybe it's

287
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:07,319
thinking about like just wanting to

288
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,629
avoid this technology like maybe we

289
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,829
should all just start walking around

290
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,930
with her head tilted at 15 degrees this

291
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,670
is an artist aaron barr soul that I work

292
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,399
with demonstrating a very simple hack

293
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,970
and this is a movement currently in

294
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,519
Berlin people are walking around with

295
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,079
their head tilted at 15 degrees to avoid

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,279
face tracking or we can go a little

297
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,040
further there's a CV dazzle from Adam

298
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,439
Harvey this is another technique for

299
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:36,939
avoiding face tracking using kind of

300
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,769
creative makeup application and fashion

301
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,660
this is again from an artist like this

302
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,819
is a reinterpretation of these same

303
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,000
technologies I really like projects like

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,160
cv cv dazzle because they represent this

305
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,750
creative response to this technology

306
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,639
rather than just you know denouncing it

307
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,579
or complaining about it I think some

308
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,829
other berlin-based artists Daniel

309
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,230
vasilia of Julian Oliver Gordon civiche

310
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,420
are doing really interesting work in the

311
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,639
space of appropriating surveillance

312
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,949
technologies and reinterpreting them so

313
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,689
news tweak is an example of one of their

314
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,480
projects they have a small router that

315
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,949
they put in the corner of the room at a

316
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,589
cafe and it takes all of the unsecured

317
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,870
wireless traffic and it doesn't man in

318
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,250
the middle attack on it and it it

319
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,170
replaces news headlines basically so

320
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,660
you're browsing the cafe internet and

321
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,939
you just discover suddenly apparently

322
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,829
ahsan just wanted for the Defense

323
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,050
Department

324
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,490
this is still running and many cafes

325
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,750
around the world actually not many

326
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,470
people know about it it's been running

327
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,950
for a year or so yeah they've also done

328
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,290
this project the transparency grenade

329
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,340
which is really nice where this device

330
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,200
intercepts unsecured traffic but instead

331
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,630
of transforming it or translating it it

332
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,490
just keeps a record and archives it for

333
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,050
later analysis so it's meant to be

334
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,020
triggered in private meetings it's a

335
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,940
tool for leaking data sort of like sue

336
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,800
valence this idea of reversing

337
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
surveillance technology to observe the

338
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,780
people in power yeah I don't I can't

339
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,190
imagine actually sneaking this into a

340
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,410
meeting but I think that's part of the

341
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,390
point yeah one more reverse all finished

342
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,160
with this two years ago it became clear

343
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,590
that it's 23 years two years ago I think

344
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,440
that Apple was storing GPS locations of

345
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
every iPhone and sending the data back

346
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,010
to their servers every now and then

347
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,690
without really clear justification they

348
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,090
see their receive really heavy criticism

349
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,320
for this and they responded by making

350
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,030
the log a little shorter and I I really

351
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,640
like the kind of artistic a response to

352
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,350
this or the creative response to this

353
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,500
which was open paths which was partially

354
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,310
Jerris or worked on this and the idea

355
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,680
was just collect all that data and use

356
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,160
it for for research purposes so that we

357
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,930
could kind of take the data that was

358
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,660
kind of already being acquired like

359
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,990
collected by Apple and do something

360
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,580
useful with it like weird everyone was

361
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,840
just speaking about in the last few

362
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,530
sessions it's interesting because Google

363
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,030
was actually doing the same thing at the

364
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,160
same time with Android phones and they

365
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,220
were using it to feed all of their

366
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,920
traffic data on google maps but for some

367
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,060
reason it didn't get as much attention

368
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,740
after it became clear that they were

369
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,560
doing this yeah and I only found out

370
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,910
about that from a friend who's a

371
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,910
security researcher in LA who told me

372
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,040
that Google was tracking your phone

373
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,620
location for Google Maps when he decided

374
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,850
that he wanted to get home from work

375
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,740
fast one day so he

376
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,160
spoofed all the traffic so that it would

377
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,810
look like the road was really busy and

378
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,570
no one took the road I think I think I

379
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,070
think that's why he didn't really write

380
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,710
it write a report on it at the time if

381
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,970
you wanted you know if you really need

382
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,170
to get home one day you just you know

383
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,860
press the script and then anyway all

384
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,630
these all these things considered I

385
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,250
don't think there's much of a question

386
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,810
like someone just said during the last

387
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,870
session like there's not this isn't

388
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,340
something that we can like stop at a

389
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,900
dead that we can't like completely

390
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,000
reverse what we've done already I don't

391
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,870
think there's a question about the

392
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,340
future of anonymity and surveillance

393
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,380
it's only going to get harder to be

394
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,910
anonymous there's too much with an

395
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,470
incentive to know where people are at

396
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,350
all the time know where people are in

397
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,750
what they're doing at all times and when

398
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,370
you're in a position of power it's

399
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,200
tempting to believe that the more

400
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,340
information you have the more

401
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,110
understanding you have about the people

402
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,550
that you're observing yeah one of the

403
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,830
most dangerous parts for me o most

404
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,270
uncomfortable parts for me about the

405
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,970
Secret Service investigation was the

406
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,870
feeling that I knew they were they were

407
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,010
watching my email they asked me at one

408
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,690
point what is your password for your

409
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,920
email account I didn't know at the time

410
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,290
that I didn't have to give it to them so

411
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,930
I said okay you know here's my password

412
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,140
and but i really i stalled for a second

413
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,460
because I'd done key tweeter and I

414
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,810
thought you know this is control

415
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,880
information this isn't just this isn't

416
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,950
just who I've been this is actually the

417
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,620
point where they get to decide who I am

418
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,320
in the future if they so choose this is

419
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,930
like the thing that determines who I am

420
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,130
so I stalled but I give it to them

421
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,880
because I wanted to see what would

422
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,730
happen it turns out nothing really

423
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,870
happened as far as I know

424
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,630
but I it I think it's really this it was

425
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,950
really disturbing for me to think that

426
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,450
you know they were distracted by this

427
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,120
huge collection of information and tried

428
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,790
to find something that made sense into

429
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,650
their conception of how they wanted me

430
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,480
to be as an individual yeah anyway I'll

431
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,310
just wrap it up though I think the only

432
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,960
answer with all of this is to embrace

433
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,360
surveillance creatively in a great

434
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,120
surveillance into our lives and spend

435
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,770
some time being anonymous spend some

436
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,870
time over sharing and figure out for

437
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,670
ourselves kind of where the where the

438
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,099
boundary lies for us what the boundary

439
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,750
between private and public is for each

440
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,520
of us and I think if you're in a

441
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,010
position to make decisions about how

442
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,750
people are exploring these topics are

443
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,839
treated it just remember that artists

444
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,220
and troublemakers are always going to be

445
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,839
important for pushing these boundaries

446
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,119
and helping us understand where things

447
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,849
break and where they work best thank you

448
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,089
very much

449
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,909
you
