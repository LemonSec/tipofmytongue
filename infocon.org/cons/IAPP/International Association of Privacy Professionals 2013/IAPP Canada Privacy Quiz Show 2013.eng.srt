privacy analyst hats and let's get this

43
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,780
game show going so quiz question number

44
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,890
one recently there was news about an

45
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,089
international privacy sweep and

46
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,480
Commissioner Stoddard this refers to hmm

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,460
a gigantic broom used to push underwear

48
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,570
under the bed when guests arrive

49
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,330
unexpectedly and i'm not talking about

50
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,260
my superman underwear hmm the Publishers

51
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,450
Clearing House lottery and a big big win

52
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,070
every time in euros or is it various

53
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,690
countries working together to examine

54
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,640
data handling practices well you know I

55
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,940
want to give an answer that gives true

56
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,910
way to the importance of you know these

57
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,190
various possibilities in my life so i'd

58
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,770
have to say number a is really hbu

59
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,950
figuring largely in my personal life as

60
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,950
some of you know who've ever come to my

61
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,860
condo one of its salient features are

62
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,500
piles of dust bunnies in the corner and

63
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,890
so the privacy sweep is really the best

64
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,479
thing that I have found after the

65
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,850
invention of the vacuum cleaner in my in

66
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,930
my life when I battle through the dust

67
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,610
bunnies get out the door get to the

68
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,470
office then I have to deal with the

69
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,470
other privacy suite which is actually a

70
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,310
lot cooler it was headed up it was the

71
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,620
idea of brant oh man where are you brand

72
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,800
homing branches over there okay big

73
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
round of applause for Brant home

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,570
injuries

75
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,249
major player on the sens team in Ottawa

76
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,469
Brent brought this wonderful idea from

77
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:56,830
the Competition Bureau he encouraged and

78
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,289
119 jurisdictions including our own bc

79
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:05,539
to join an examination of online privacy

80
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,800
policies during the same week and we did

81
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,479
it all together we're discussing the

82
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,039
results when you hear more about it this

83
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,439
summer so that's that's the second less

84
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,139
important privacy sweet very good Liz

85
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,680
did you want to add anything our office

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,919
looked at I think 250 websites in bc our

87
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,330
sweep included not-for-profit

88
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,789
organizations and political parties that

89
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,300
are uniquely subject to the vc law and

90
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,399
we found that only forty-nine percent of

91
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,369
these bc businesses had privacy policies

92
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,849
so we're frowning down on that and we

93
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,639
the results will come out with the

94
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,959
commissioners with the federal

95
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,959
commissioners and the other participants

96
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,430
only in forty-nine percent forty-nine

97
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,279
percent and we've had the laws enforced

98
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,289
for how many years now okay quiz

99
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:07,729
question number two drones are Phil

100
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,399
Kessel Dion Phaneuf and any other member

101
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,879
of the Maple Leafs

102
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,770
this brave hey Granada was an Ottawa fan

103
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,390
to come into Toronto ins yeah a topic

104
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,980
that the awesome privacy scan just wrote

105
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,480
about that's a shelf that shameless

106
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,670
self-promotion sorry but that don't know

107
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,070
how I threw that in a technology that

108
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,140
poses some serious privacy questions and

109
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,100
issues dr. Kevorkian do you want to

110
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,710
tackle that question you need the mic

111
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,080
I'm gonna say none of the above although

112
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,500
i would probably lean towards see drones

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,370
are an amazing new technology that for

114
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,610
proper purposes will have amazing

115
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,260
results for search and rescue missions

116
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,020
and there's so many uses they've been

117
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,080
used in ontario by the OPP and Halton

118
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,800
Region Police for completely unrelated

119
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,540
to surveillance activities such as

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,790
search and rescue and going into remote

121
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,160
areas but the the threat of course

122
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,200
arises when they are used in a covert

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,570
manner to engage in public surveillance

124
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,240
domestic surveillance completely

125
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,090
unacceptable and the good news is in the

126
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,700
states 32 states have already either

127
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,169
introduced her in the process of

128
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,820
introducing bills to prohibit the use of

129
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,070
drones for purposes of domestic

130
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,349
surveillance without a warrant that this

131
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,510
is awesome it's already happening very

132
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,570
proactively for once which is

133
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,020
outstanding and in Canada we see I seem

134
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,220
to have less concerned certainly in

135
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,200
Ontario the police forces we spoken to

136
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,780
are not even contemplating the use of

137
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,810
drones for purposes of surveillance so

138
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,060
we have to remain ever vigilant because

139
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,180
this is one technology that if you take

140
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,490
your eye off the ball it will just leap

141
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,080
ahead and we won't be able to pull it

142
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,610
back it's an ideal application of

143
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,800
privacy by design and we're working on

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,510
this actively now we've got a paper

145
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,330
coming out actually next week the week

146
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,070
after next June the fourth called

147
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,470
surveillance then and now and it's an

148
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,930
examination of surveillance starting

149
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,410
with the olden days

150
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,940
cameras which used to be a thing of the

151
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,560
past and going through GPS automatic

152
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:39,180
license of lrp recognition and ending

153
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,709
with drones so we're taking a sweeping

154
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,870
look at surveillance potential and the

155
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,639
only thing I want to leave with you is

156
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,100
we have to find ways to come in front of

157
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,509
technologies that will engage in

158
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,149
surveillance especially in a covert

159
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,310
manner where you're given no notice and

160
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,500
the example that comes to mind which

161
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,279
you're going to think is not

162
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,629
surveillance related and it's not

163
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:03,329
technically is google glass when you

164
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,490
think of google glass it's someone

165
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,649
wearing glasses that has the capacity to

166
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,050
take your picture perhaps videotape

167
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,420
without your knowledge or consent to

168
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,000
that I say what I want to see and I want

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,709
any techies out there to give me this I

170
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,660
want a technology that would enable me

171
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,810
to put on the equivalent of privacy

172
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,500
glasses that would in effect block the

173
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,720
transmission or the interception by

174
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,339
Google glass or any other wearable

175
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,610
device of my facial image and think of

176
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,529
Star Trek think of force fields that's

177
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,060
what I want to develop so that people

178
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,980
have a response to this and be able to

179
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,779
say no because they're not going to know

180
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,240
who's doing it where so we need to

181
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,459
respond to technology with technology we

182
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,180
need to get smart about this excellent

183
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,319
yes Misha shudders yeah can I just point

184
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:57,329
out that i think the real answer is not

185
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,870
among those three the drones are is a

186
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,689
term used when somebody goes on for too

187
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,870
long

188
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:21,950
wait the gloves are off road collecting

189
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,780
and using big I'm moving right along

190
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,320
here um good collecting and using big

191
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,390
data is like a Big Mac hard to digest uh

192
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,660
it's an American sitcom um no sorry is

193
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,260
that the big bang theory or an

194
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,240
invaluable or for research but a

195
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,860
potential threat to privacy if not

196
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,550
handled properly Commissioner Clayton it

197
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,490
could be any of those like a Big Mac

198
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,380
hard to digest that's kind of the same

199
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,810
as C invaluable for research but a

200
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,020
potential threat I actually I think that

201
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,230
tongue well big data is a very very hot

202
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,120
topic at this privacy conference there's

203
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,160
been a lot of sessions where you know

204
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,310
some some real experts in the field some

205
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,840
people are spending a lot of time

206
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,870
looking at Big Data have been here to

207
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,580
talk to you and ran raise some of those

208
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,140
issues i'm not going to go into all of

209
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,910
the issues but i will point out a couple

210
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,120
that that that you know there are the

211
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,850
flags there are the things that not to

212
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,320
overuse the phrase i've already used it

213
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,640
a couple times today but the things that

214
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,520
keep us up at night the potential for

215
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,630
big data is obviously vast enormous and

216
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,670
you know i'm certainly one of those

217
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,470
people who believes in the value of

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,420
information just ask anybody that I work

219
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,970
for I'm looking for stats all the time

220
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm trying to get some information so

221
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,780
that i can make decisions so I I get how

222
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,810
important that is but but it has to be

223
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,780
done properly and we've heard a lot at

224
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,010
this conference also about the

225
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,350
accountability framework you know if

226
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,790
you're moving in that direction that

227
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,060
drones Big Data social media cloud

228
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,680
computing all of these things it's not

229
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,320
it's not the technology that we should

230
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,390
necessarily be afraid of it's making

231
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,490
sure that it's done properly with due

232
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,080
regard to to privacy and the

233
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,210
accountability framework is one way of

234
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,390
doing that I less concern

235
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,460
about some of these these new

236
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,760
technologies if the proper foundation is

237
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,980
in place if we know that organizations

238
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,380
have you know the policies and the

239
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,330
procedures but not just those things

240
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,400
that they're checking and rechecking and

241
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,670
evergreening their their programs if

242
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,530
that foundation if the framework is in

243
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,960
place and I think there's room to go in

244
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,030
some of these directions so collecting

245
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,370
using big data I'm going to go with C so

246
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,440
yes invaluable for research but a

247
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
potential threat if not handled properly

248
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,130
you have to set it up right to begin

249
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,660
with excellent thank you any other

250
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,060
comments on that no I was going to say

251
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,510
that I think the challenges of big data

252
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,800
are absolutely hear what I hear about in

253
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,500
the health care sector is that

254
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,570
especially with the Canadian publicly

255
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,820
paid system we're all sitting on this

256
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,960
incredible treasure trove of data and if

257
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,970
we don't mind it and use it properly

258
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,870
then babies will die so we get into this

259
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,960
this really challenging dialogue with

260
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,840
with researchers with academics that

261
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,680
want to actually use this incredibly

262
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,870
important information pharmaceutical

263
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,080
data to come up with new solutions that

264
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,990
will allow us to live longer the

265
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,770
challenge is how do we actually how do

266
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,430
we do that well still allow the

267
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,040
principles of privacy to be applied and

268
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,020
I'm out there saying all the time that

269
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,880
research and privacy are friends not

270
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,730
foes but where I really see it in

271
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,170
British Columbia where I see this

272
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,600
dialogue about big data is in health

273
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,900
care mm-hmm yes go ahead in and if I

274
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,030
could just agree completely with what

275
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,440
Liz and Jill said and just add one thing

276
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,560
the key to big data is d identify if you

277
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,630
lead with D identifying especially

278
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,540
health related data you can maximize the

279
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,790
benefits of the data for full health

280
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,010
research purposes and protect privacy

281
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,290
completely securely strongly there are

282
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,120
excellent d identification tools out

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,130
there everyone knows of khalid el mmm

284
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,260
and his outstanding d identification

285
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,500
tools and I applaud Alberta

286
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,710
that have used his tools on their entire

287
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,360
health database and are getting the

288
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,620
multiple benefits excellent excellent um

289
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,800
having a speaking about health data all

290
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,440
right having true control over your

291
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,260
personal health information is a myth

292
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,280
true or false true the health care

293
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,340
sector simply cannot be trusted or false

294
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,710
our laws provide adequate protections

295
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,900
and they strike the right balance or you

296
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,610
can go off the map here and say none of

297
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,840
the above who wants to tackle that

298
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,050
question well I'll follow sure um I

299
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,570
actually I actually I'm gonna dodge that

300
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,050
entirely okay do that right I'm lon

301
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,830
Quist I'm the star goalie I actually

302
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,150
think that we've got a lot more

303
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,420
challenges than whether or not we

304
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,370
absolutely have control over our health

305
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,610
data I think that the current paradigm

306
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,310
of personal information protection and

307
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,350
standalone health information is broken

308
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,960
just going to put that out there I think

309
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,790
that we're really going to have to

310
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,520
examine our Health Information

311
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,300
legislation to deal with IT challenges

312
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,589
of EHRs to deal with tissue banks and

313
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:58,620
genomics to be able to deal with the

314
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,140
fact that individuals are more more

315
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,120
often than not now custodians of their

316
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,400
own health information so I think all of

317
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,280
these issues will shift and I don't

318
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,470
think that even the newest standalone

319
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,619
Health Information legislation is

320
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,810
adapting or can actually deal with this

321
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,990
new environment bigger challenges to

322
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,130
come so you want to see more legislation

323
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,230
no I want to see more flexibility in the

324
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,180
legislation and I really don't think

325
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,730
that the challenge is right in front of

326
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,800
us are dealt with adequately in our

327
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,010
legislative framework that we have now

328
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,770
dr. Couvillion yet and and I think this

329
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,870
is one area where in addition to

330
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,510
legislation and new frameworks processes

331
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,790
and

332
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,500
to protect the data we're going to look

333
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,560
for new ways to protect data how can we

334
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,040
get smart about the use of data and

335
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,950
would it be possible to enable the data

336
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,650
to protect themselves could we add some

337
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,010
artificial agents to the data that

338
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,650
render the data in effect

339
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,580
self-protective and I know it's a

340
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,320
far-out context we're doing this at U of

341
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,420
T I chair something called the identity

342
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,670
privacy and security Institute and we're

343
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,140
introducing something called Smart Data

344
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,150
smart data if you look at our website

345
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,680
you can learn more about it it's all

346
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,370
about arming the data in a way that

347
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,320
enables greater control by the data

348
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,320
subject and proper contextual use which

349
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,000
would only come from the dot data

350
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,830
subject it's looking to the future

351
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,820
because in the future we're going to

352
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,310
have to have greater intelligence not

353
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,530
only in terms of our processes and

354
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,050
legislative frameworks but arming the

355
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,380
data itself to protect itself in finding

356
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,360
waste in so great er control on the part

357
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,200
of patients and data subjects go ahead i

358
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,510
can I speak out of turn I just wanted to

359
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,400
follow up on on this question it's it's

360
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,180
of interest to me and I'm I agree with

361
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,100
what you said I do think that um that

362
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,690
the legislative framework is not ideal

363
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,070
but i do want to speak up for our

364
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,140
standalone health law in alberta because

365
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,660
i think there are some some some

366
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,520
interesting things in that legislation

367
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,670
that that actually frankly might work in

368
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,140
the private sector or the public sector

369
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,820
i mean there's there's nothing nothing

370
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,430
is ever perfect but you know this this

371
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,350
idea of having true controlling laws

372
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,850
providing adequate protections in

373
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,480
alberta basically information is shared

374
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,390
among healthcare providers so that if i

375
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,210
live in edmonton now city of champions

376
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,430
by the way city of really it's

377
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,980
really bad that team it was right to me

378
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know Vancouver isn't in the

379
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,460
playoffs this year hasn't been a riot

380
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,950
and no my absence

381
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:57,960
and an the Toronto Maple Leafs oh my

382
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,500
goodness oh my goodness well what are

383
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,900
you doing here I think somebody goes to

384
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,380
the penalty just because I was getting

385
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,740
too serious by two minutes I am not

386
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,230
calling any hotties no no penalties no

387
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,260
penalties you have a whistle I you need

388
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,530
a whistle I do need a whistle yeah um

389
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,050
yes I was things I was talking about the

390
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,210
health law now in Alberta because you

391
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,740
were talking about what the health law

392
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,360
in Alberta that's right helpful in

393
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,600
Alberta so there's this idea that if I'm

394
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,250
if I'm living in Edmonton city of

395
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,710
Champions and I'm injured in lethbridge

396
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,440
for example that my health care provider

397
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,300
the health care provider who is treating

398
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,220
me will have access to my information

399
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,160
this is this is a very good thing and

400
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,860
information in that circle is shared for

401
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,920
the most part without consent but it's

402
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,350
balanced by all sorts of controls

403
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,410
including controls that patients are

404
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,870
able to exercise we spent a lot of time

405
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,060
last year and we're still promoting this

406
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,100
working on a document that we published

407
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,350
which is a patient rights document

408
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,580
because we've had the health legislation

409
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,440
for over 10 years now and you know there

410
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,740
are some the ability for patients to you

411
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,740
know the healthcare treatment provider

412
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,900
is required by law to consider a

413
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,820
patient's express wishes if they don't

414
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,170
want their information to go to a

415
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,330
particular healthcare provider the

416
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,910
legislation includes a legal requirement

417
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,260
to to record disclosures of information

418
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,180
so it might be being shared without

419
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,400
consent but you have to keep a record of

420
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,530
that it's explicit in the legislation

421
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,510
that a patient can go and get a copy of

422
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,480
the audit log and patients don't know

423
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,920
these things that they have those

424
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,840
controls that it set out explicitly in

425
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,610
legislation so I'm not saying that it's

426
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,850
a perfect piece of legislation but but

427
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,140
there are some of those those rights and

428
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,540
controls individual controls that can be

429
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,060
exercised we've been doing our bit to to

430
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,520
to make that information available to

431
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,350
individuals because there hasn't that's

432
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,190
never really happened in Alberta and I

433
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,990
think it's resulting in some extra work

434
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,250
for some of the you know the health

435
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,240
region and the ministry but I think it's

436
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,980
really important you can build those

437
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,110
controls into legislation to make it

438
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,240
stronger even if you have laws that are

439
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,260
allowing for some of this information

440
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,410
sharing but I think with new technology

441
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,950
and with data analyst Ella analytics

442
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,490
applied to healthcare then those what

443
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,760
used to be discreet uses whether it's

444
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,580
patient care quality assurance system

445
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,270
management and research are becoming

446
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,310
increasingly blurred so I do think that

447
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,730
that our approach is really needs a new

448
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,890
and more flexible framework a new look

449
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,570
at it how we're going to deal with

450
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,030
genomics I don't know with this kind of

451
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,070
framework so I think you know maybe

452
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,960
there needs to be more flexibility

453
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,450
around around policy in this area well

454
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,640
and I think one of the other issues is

455
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,020
around transparency I won't go on about

456
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,900
this but Tom speaking about big data and

457
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,400
the information that's Indian Singh an

458
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,750
electronic health record one of the

459
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,770
things about the electronic health

460
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,510
records nobody has any idea what the

461
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,770
heck is going on in that what

462
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,330
information is in there how it's being

463
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,060
used what those secondary uses are so in

464
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,890
some ways I think you know the focus

465
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,020
needs to be on transparency for some of

466
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,640
these initiatives and making it clear to

467
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,470
individuals so they can exercise their

468
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,260
rights and they can take control my

469
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,700
office would kill me if I didn't mention

470
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,590
p HIPAA so I must tell you about

471
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,940
Ontario's personal health information

472
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,090
protection act which I would suggest is

473
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,130
the world's best health information

474
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,800
privacy law but don't take my word for

475
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,840
it the Institute of Medicine two years

476
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,450
ago in the US studied health information

477
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,040
privacy laws all around the world

478
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,870
because they wanted to use one as a

479
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,120
framework to base their revisions on the

480
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,880
US HIPAA the only existing statute they

481
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,040
pointed to for that would serve as a

482
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,990
model for such revisions was Ontario's p

483
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,180
HIPAA and it is very similar in terms of

484
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,340
the concept of the circle of care which

485
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,430
assumes the the patient's implied

486
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,710
consent for use within their healthcare

487
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,850
providers so it's right

488
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,820
if my GP refers me to a specialist who

489
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,770
sends me to the lab for testing they can

490
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,690
assume my implied consent for all those

491
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,340
purposes which are for the purpose of my

492
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,559
health care but an individual can say no

493
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,210
if they don't want their information

494
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,669
shared it is a wonderful model it

495
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:27,309
enables access to information when it's

496
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:29,280
needed and then if you're contemplating

497
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,330
sending the information out to a

498
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,429
third-party outside of the circle care

499
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:35,770
the walls go up positive consent is

500
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,330
required on the part of the patient the

501
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,549
data subject before that happens it's

502
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,890
been working fabulously here in Ontario

503
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,470
since 2004 we oversee compliance with

504
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,820
the legislation which applies to both

505
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,159
public and private sector agencies and

506
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,320
it is an outstanding statute we have a

507
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,390
lot of information a lot of guidance

508
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,039
documents on our website if you want to

509
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,620
take a look commissioners daughter did

510
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,679
yeah baby well being a European I

511
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,750
thought you'd like to know what's what's

512
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,880
happening in Europe and I was lucky to

513
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,169
be invited to an international genomic

514
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,539
research conference in Europe a couple

515
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,120
of weeks ago and doing the background

516
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,370
reading for that and preparing my

517
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,150
remarks with some of my staff I came to

518
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,530
the position you can I think this is

519
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,440
supposed to our website by now that in

520
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,580
the area of medical research given the

521
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,830
particular context giving the strong

522
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,409
ethical framework given the

523
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,610
professionalization of the people

524
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,360
involved given the public cost this is

525
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,830
not exactly what I said there but given

526
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,289
the importance of the public interest

527
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:49,480
involved that consent may not be the

528
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,460
centerpiece of how we deal with people's

529
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,520
information I think that we should as we

530
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,799
go forward say this is an area where

531
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,230
it's not practicable if you're doing

532
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,659
genetic research genomic research and

533
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,159
you're mixing things up and you have to

534
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,780
get samples apparently according to

535
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,720
these are internationally known genetic

536
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,340
research experts from thousands and ten

537
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,610
thousands of people in cohorts in order

538
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,310
to validate for example rare disease

539
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,590
and so on so i came to the opinion that

540
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,680
in that context i thought we could

541
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,020
dispense with consent of course things

542
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,990
are d anonymized and so on remains the

543
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,630
ethical issue of course if you discover

544
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,740
some medical situation over which a

545
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,590
person would have control if they were

546
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,950
informed than my opinion would be you

547
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,290
should go back try and identify them and

548
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,670
try and warn them because they can do

549
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,820
something so that's that was kind of for

550
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,430
me a glimpse into the future yeah but

551
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,800
increasingly we our community has to be

552
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,990
involved in these policy discussions

553
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,360
deeply involved and I think Canadians

554
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,850
expect their information to be used for

555
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,610
Public Interest medical research so we

556
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,560
better not have these conversations that

557
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,660
are going like that we have to be at the

558
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,510
table yeah excellent but so but on that

559
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,370
and there was a very interesting

560
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,940
workshop here on the European regulation

561
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,620
this group of researchers are very

562
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,750
concerned because the latest comment

563
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,060
says the Albrect report on the European

564
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,480
regulation does not allow scientific

565
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,330
research to be one of the exceptions to

566
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,370
the consent model so of course the

567
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,220
medical community is in overdrive and I

568
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,170
must say I sympathize with me but we

569
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,820
know the European regulation is far from

570
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,530
being adopted at the present time but

571
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,230
that is a concern in my opinion because

572
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,720
I agree with the player at the end of

573
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,170
the line yes that it is a public

574
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,000
interest issue we all have an interest

575
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,310
in finding the best way to deal with our

576
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,240
health issues okay thanks Lane so for a

577
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,070
true-and-false question that generated a

578
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,250
lot of discussion I thought they were

579
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,110
just gonna flip a coin um next question

580
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,180
a comprehensive privacy program is a

581
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,420
really really really really big one it's

582
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,580
a rarity sort of like winning all four

583
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,240
Series in the playoffs or it's an

584
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,640
essential way for an artist organization

585
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,950
to try to comply with the law

586
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,100
commissioners daughter

587
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,310
hmm well I don't know some people would

588
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,350
say it's a really really big one and its

589
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,150
really expensive and that's why they

590
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,490
don't invest in them that's what I was

591
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,030
talking about yesterday and so it is

592
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,870
kind of a rarity too but if you look at

593
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,250
it more positively it could be see and

594
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:59,290
in fact myself and Liz's office and

595
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,470
Jill's office have all produced a

596
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,730
document about how to set up a

597
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,220
comprehensive privacy program and so I

598
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,990
hope people are you know reading this

599
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,930
and taking it to heart and again you

600
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,080
know I think this is so important that

601
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,190
we have to have some way to check up on

602
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,500
it and so I come back to how do you

603
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,120
demonstrate accountability you

604
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,610
demonstrate it because you've got a

605
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,710
comprehensive privacy program but I

606
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,020
didn't work on this nearly as much as

607
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,990
Liz denim did so she's probably got more

608
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,400
thoughts on I think my staff are getting

609
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,500
tired of me talking about the

610
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,920
accountability paper so just to really

611
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,270
really bug them I decided that we had to

612
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,940
write another paper another paper about

613
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,040
accountability in the public sector

614
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,590
which our offices is going to be

615
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,170
releasing in the in the coming weeks but

616
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,490
in all seriousness I do think that the

617
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,360
establishment of comprehensive full some

618
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,610
privacy management programs our way

619
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,220
through of the mire that we see right

620
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,460
now so I don't see how any organization

621
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,100
unless you're the corner dry cleaner can

622
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,940
do 21st century information processing

623
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,280
using personal information so we're

624
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,350
talking about global data flows we're

625
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,960
talking about big data which is just

626
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,480
data analytics on steroids we're talking

627
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,820
about the application of new technology

628
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,370
you can't do that work

629
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,430
without having the management processes

630
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,090
in place across your organization and

631
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,260
increasingly you'll see that the

632
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,650
commissioners will be using this privacy

633
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,110
management framework in our enforcement

634
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,240
work and the work that you do with your

635
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,930
programs will have evidentiary value in

636
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,550
investigations and audits boy that was a

637
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,140
really serious answer that was very

638
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:12,220
shoes it's okay next question privacy by

639
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,240
design guess who's this this one is

640
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,470
directed to privacy by design is a great

641
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,160
concept but putting it into practice is

642
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,110
well it's it is just like that new

643
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,490
awesome sends Jersey it hides figures

644
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,450
yes putting it into practice is

645
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,370
virtually impossible unless of course

646
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,960
you have Commissioner kabuki as your

647
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,140
spokesperson or it's not as difficult as

648
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,059
you might think and totally worth it

649
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,420
this one's easy of course we've been

650
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:01,170
pushing this for many years now but the

651
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,500
beautiful vision that I have that I had

652
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,050
is is coming into fruition so privacy by

653
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,120
design has now been translated into 31

654
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,730
languages all around the world think of

655
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,980
a major language it appears in that

656
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,360
language and we didn't we didn't pay for

657
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,010
any of that we just reached out I would

658
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,300
reach out to my colleagues in different

659
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,580
jurisdictions and they at their own

660
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,250
behest are translating this and adopting

661
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,140
it I can give you examples from all

662
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,330
around the world we get contacted all

663
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,340
the time Japan has an active movement

664
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,860
Singapore just contacted us there's

665
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,510
there's so much all around of course the

666
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,500
EU it's in their regulation in the FTC

667
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,070
privacy by design is the first of three

668
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,840
recommended best practices for privacy

669
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,210
so what's the big deal why is it taking

670
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,429
off why was it made the international

671
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,680
framework for protecting privacy in 20

672
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,870
ten that was unanimously passed by

673
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,420
privacy commissioners and data

674
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,270
protection authorities the reason is we

675
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,360
as commissioners do a very strong job I

676
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,130
think we do a very good job we really

677
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,500
take our work seriously but increasingly

678
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,600
the majority of privacy and fractions

679
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,310
don't even come to the surface if you

680
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,260
think of the tip of the iceberg if we

681
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,940
get the tip of the iceberg we're lucky

682
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,890
because with the growth of ubiquitous

683
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,930
computing Wi-Fi positioning systems

684
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,480
online social connectivity data

685
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
everywhere it is simply impossible to

686
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,530
address all the infractions that are

687
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,900
arising and so the privacy by design

688
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,050
model is proactive instead of offering

689
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,810
reactive regulatory compliance after the

690
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,060
fact to offer systems of redress we're

691
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,830
trying to also prevent the harms from

692
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,540
arising you think of a preventive

693
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,670
medical model much better to detect the

694
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,320
cancer and prevent it rather than allow

695
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,600
it to arise and offer chemo afterwards

696
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,940
so we're trying to prevent it and it's

697
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,700
not a concept anymore I can point to you

698
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,550
too we have a paper we did in December

699
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,470
called operationalizing privacy by

700
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,080
design in it we reference nine different

701
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,460
areas in which it's on the ground

702
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,890
working ranging from all the things you

703
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,860
might think of CCTV cameras biometrics

704
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,350
sensores you name it this can be

705
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,900
embedded in technology biometrics in a

706
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,000
way that on a go-forward basis you can

707
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,580
prevent the harm from arising and I

708
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,230
called last year the year the engineer I

709
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,639
went around the world trying to talk to

710
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,409
engineers to get their input how doable

711
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,380
is this every single person I spoke to

712
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,050
said of course we can do it if we get

713
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,489
those instructions at the time we're

714
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,380
designing the technology where the

715
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,540
business practice or informational

716
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,940
process if you address it at the outset

717
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,770
you can embed it into the data

718
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,080
architecture into the processes you can

719
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,840
make it a reality and minimize not only

720
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,449
your the privacy items but the cost your

721
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,130
organization by avoiding the data

722
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,380
breaches avoiding the harm to your brand

723
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,300
into your reputation you can do all of

724
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,730
this at a fraction of the cost by

725
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,739
embedding it at the outset into the

726
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,889
process and so it I'm glad to say it is

727
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,870
in fact a reality its operating all

728
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,520
around the world and if you go to our

729
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,010
privacy by design dot CA website you'll

730
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,870
find countless of examples of how it's

731
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,700
working on the ground right now and

732
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,740
and just just to build because we've

733
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,530
been talking a lot this these past

734
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,000
couple days about reform to our laws

735
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,570
particularly our reform in Canada and

736
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,060
the need for it and we are starting to

737
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,640
see privacy by design being incorporated

738
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,369
into legal requirements in other

739
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,290
jurisdictions I think I know the answer

740
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,130
but would you like to see pbd

741
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,950
incorporated into our laws like made as

742
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,770
a specific requirement in our privacy

743
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,660
laws I would love that and we wrote a

744
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,820
paper two years ago privacy by design in

745
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,730
the law and we had a forward from the

746
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,420
Honorable Pamela who was here Jones

747
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,250
harbour I don't know where she is but

748
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,230
she wrote a wonderful forward in how

749
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,359
they were contemplating doing this at

750
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,369
the FTC in the United States of Federal

751
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:59,800
Trade Commission we have in Ontario a

752
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,200
privacy by design center of excellence

753
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,599
that the Ontario public sector has just

754
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,020
put up now so it is inching its way into

755
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,510
government organizations if we could

756
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,520
find a way to introduce it in

757
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,800
legislation and the way you would do

758
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,750
that is you're not going to tell people

759
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,369
what to do you're just going to plant

760
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:21,369
the notion of proactively embedding some

761
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,319
privacy protective features at the

762
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:26,099
outset of programs and initiatives and

763
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,079
technologies and if you could plant that

764
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,500
seed then maybe it would grow and would

765
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
I was going to say minimize our work

766
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,500
it's not going to minimize our work

767
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,119
because there's that work is growing

768
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,710
even the tip of the iceberg but it would

769
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,839
be amazing because it would minimize the

770
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:43,000
harms I've seen that again and again so

771
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,740
hopefully take a look at the oh p.s a

772
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,510
center of excellence for privacy by

773
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,700
design it was just initiated about six

774
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,710
months ago and it's really growing Thank

775
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:56,200
You Liz no I think the point is if

776
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,900
you're going to adopt shiny new toys and

777
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,810
you know new ways of crunching data then

778
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,420
you have to have privacy by design and

779
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,250
privacy by design is part of a

780
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,609
comprehensive accountable organization

781
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:11,170
I'll keep saying those words over and

782
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,349
over so do you think it's already exists

783
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,910
it does I mean there are Pathfinder

784
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,750
companies

785
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,670
there are Pathfinder organizations I

786
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,910
think particular and financial services

787
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,460
certainly in some of the telkom's

788
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,290
obviously the health sector you can see

789
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,260
some real leaders in this work but we

790
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,240
need to go further and you know what

791
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,800
I've been talking about now is the

792
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,470
public sector because arguably they

793
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,470
should be held to a higher standard than

794
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,170
the private sector because the state can

795
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,330
compel our information and let's face it

796
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,310
facebook doesn't knock on our door at

797
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,200
three o'clock in the morning so I think

798
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,930
the public sector needs to step up and

799
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,180
do a much better job of privacy by

800
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,200
design of accountable full some privacy

801
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,820
management program so that's where I'm

802
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:02,310
going next any bc public bodies here

803
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,670
she's on the warpath next question a

804
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,960
pre-employment criminal background

805
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,110
checks are there no longer necessary

806
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:19,930
because we have facebook they're a handy

807
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,810
tool for next year's hockey draft picks

808
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,640
are there an invasive screening

809
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,260
technique that should only be used in

810
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,190
limited circumstances Commissioner

811
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,070
Clayton you wanna had tackled i won hmm

812
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,300
I think the answer is C but I think

813
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,790
there are an awful lot of organizations

814
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:45,130
that think the answer is a unfortunately

815
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,530
Alberta actually doesn't have a great

816
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,320
rep for criminal background checks I

817
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
think there was a report was it last

818
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,030
year the Canadian civil liberties did a

819
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,920
study of criminal that was pretty

820
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,360
release information checks yeah and

821
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,190
Alberta did not come out very well in

822
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,280
that

823
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,360
in that study and I think that part of

824
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,160
the problem is that there's no there's

825
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,120
there are no standards in Alberta at the

826
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,190
moment for criminal background checks

827
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,930
and and what an organization's an

828
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,930
employer might be asking for on the one

829
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,850
hand and what they actually need are

830
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,420
also two very very different things so

831
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,490
you know I do know that there's a

832
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,810
there's a group that's gotten together

833
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,480
in Alberta that's actually taking a look

834
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,970
at at criminal background checks and

835
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,500
what information is collected and what

836
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,940
information is being shared and I know

837
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,320
that you know Liz will have something to

838
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,270
say about this because she's done a an

839
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,720
interesting report on the topic I think

840
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,430
all I'm going to say is that we haven't

841
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,310
looked at it very deeply in Alberta we

842
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,100
get occasional complaints and we've been

843
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,660
very we've been reactive to that but we

844
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,010
are involved with this group right now

845
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,250
that's trying to proactively figure out

846
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,550
how to solve some of the problems when

847
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,560
too much information is being shared and

848
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,970
organizations are collecting this

849
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,920
information with again without first

850
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,650
turning their mind to do I actually need

851
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,180
this information and of course once you

852
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,920
get this information that brings on a

853
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,720
whole other set of responsibilities what

854
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,950
are you going to do with it and how are

855
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,390
you going to limit access to it and how

856
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,890
long are you going to keep it because

857
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,020
it's a snapshot in time and what if you

858
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,670
ask for this information you find out

859
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,320
something that raises flags for you is a

860
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,870
DUI a problem is a break and enter with

861
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,090
like you know it raises all sorts of

862
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,850
issues it's a far more complicated thing

863
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,490
than just we're going to as a blanket

864
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,650
program do criminal background checks on

865
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,950
everybody yeah so it's tricky and I know

866
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,200
will you'll have some calm

867
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,410
on this well we are office did an audit

868
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,630
of the bc provincial governments

869
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,579
criminal records check policy and we

870
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:57,280
found that there there has to be a nexus

871
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,010
between the requirements of the job and

872
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,170
what kind of background check you're

873
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,940
doing so whether it's a criminal

874
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,190
background check or other types of

875
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,839
checks so I mean that's the principle

876
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,869
the bc government was not only doing a

877
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,599
criminal records check on everybody but

878
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,750
also doing a recheck every five years

879
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,660
and every time somebody changed jobs so

880
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,079
our report came out and we had eight

881
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,670
recommendations the provincial

882
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,770
government backed off on their recheck

883
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,500
policy they backed off and defined more

884
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,720
clearly the types and classifications of

885
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,730
jobs for which there should be a

886
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,490
criminal records check that was one

887
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,700
thing might I have what is keeping me up

888
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,910
at night our police information checks

889
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,920
so criminal records checks are a check

890
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,730
for outstanding charges and convictions

891
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,160
police information checks is a broader

892
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,609
review of all kinds of information

893
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:57,310
that's in a police database collected

894
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,190
for law enforcement and again revealing

895
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,310
all kinds of negative police contact

896
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,089
complaints about the neighbor

897
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,740
investigations that have not resulted in

898
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,589
a charge and I think that information

899
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:13,540
may be valid for law enforcement it's

900
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,450
not valid in the context of employment

901
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,270
and last time I checked in Canada there

902
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,730
was a presumption of innocence and so

903
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,349
I'm much more concerned about the

904
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:25,240
practice of police information checks

905
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,950
Michael McAvoy and I have been having

906
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,410
long discussions with both the police

907
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,710
services and employer groups in NBC

908
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,170
we're not moving very quickly on this so

909
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,940
my next step is an enforcement action

910
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,869
mr. Stoddard yeah Liz's touched

911
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,069
something that's really really

912
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,690
concerning to us in the federal

913
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,790
jurisdiction that is the broadening of

914
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,230
the information that some would like to

915
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,559
be available not only to

916
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:57,839
employers for background checks but also

917
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,660
to law enforcement and it goes far

918
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,019
beyond and and the the infrastructure is

919
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:08,219
being set up now far beyond do you have

920
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:11,009
a conviction but were you merely under

921
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:13,650
investigation what everything what did

922
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,390
you do in today's privacy news we see

923
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,979
that some would like to take DNA samples

924
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:27,150
from people who are mere suspects and so

925
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,819
this constant constant broadening of the

926
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,789
circle of information of anybody who

927
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:35,549
could be rightly or wrongly nearly or or

928
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:38,579
more distantly connected with a possible

929
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:41,160
criminal is certainly of great concern

930
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,879
it's just concerning absolutely okay

931
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,819
public opinion surveys about privacy

932
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,329
reveal wallhack whatever you want them

933
00:43:54,329 --> 00:44:00,839
to say privacy is dead or that everybody

934
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,819
has a crush on Sidney Crosby even me

935
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:06,390
although not not right now I'm suspend

936
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,839
I'm suspending my crush on Sidney Crosby

937
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:12,449
that individual still care deeply about

938
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:16,219
their privacy commissioner's daughter

939
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:20,309
well I certainly don't have a crush on

940
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:22,679
Sidney Crosby because I'm gonna be him

941
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:29,609
tonight yes and as for privacy being

942
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,679
dead the only people ever said that had

943
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,479
a vested monetary interest in killing it

944
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:40,019
so that leaves us with see let's see

945
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:43,920
what some of our polling can say about

946
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,459
that in fact it tends to contradict that

947
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:49,949
statement quite radically I mean when we

948
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:52,739
pull Canadians and I want to give this

949
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:55,890
to you accurately so I'm going to read

950
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,289
from a press release many Canadians

951
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:00,269
reported being very concerned about

952
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:02,609
posting information about their location

953
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:05,459
and their contact information the

954
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:06,810
majority of

955
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,210
said that they decided not to install or

956
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,330
to have uninstalled a nap because of the

957
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,070
amount of personal information they

958
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,470
would have to provide and over

959
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,330
two-thirds of Canadians say they have

960
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,520
chosen not to use a site or a service

961
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,530
because they were uncomfortable with the

962
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,110
terms of the privacy policy and as I

963
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,420
explained to those of you who were in

964
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,250
the audience yesterday that's probably

965
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,100
an underestimation so privacy is far

966
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,230
from dead for Canadians it's a real

967
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,580
concern folks who use mobile apps or a

968
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,210
little more savvy I would say that's

969
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,210
about what they do to protect themselves

970
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,580
that's all good but some other

971
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,200
statistics that should give us all pause

972
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,130
to reflect the importance of this value

973
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,990
71 percent that's almost three Canadians

974
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,760
out of four think protecting the

975
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,710
personal information of Canadians will

976
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,480
be one of the most important issues

977
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,830
facing our country in the next 10 years

978
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,690
only one in five think the federal

979
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,460
government takes its responsibility to

980
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,350
protect personal information seriously

981
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,360
and only thirteen percent feel that

982
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,860
businesses are serious about their

983
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,130
privacy responsibility and I don't know

984
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,190
how many of you have heard about

985
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,960
notification fatigue this is often

986
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,660
brought up Oh even if we had data breach

987
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,250
protection people don't want to be

988
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,470
notified in notification fatigue they

989
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,060
just throw all these things in the

990
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,200
garbage and so on well we've never

991
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,540
really had it except in Alberta so we

992
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,770
don't know that much about it but 97%

993
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,240
ninety-seven percent that's almost all

994
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,550
of the Canadians fold want to be

995
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,680
notified by an organization if their

996
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,330
personal information was compromised so

997
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:58,380
you know I think privacy is certainly

998
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,870
alive and well and this is I'd say a

999
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,340
growing concern among canadians

1000
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,240
excellent excellent thank you very much

1001
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,620
speaking about mandatory breach

1002
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:15,450
notification it is a total pain and you

1003
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,530
know what only followed by those

1004
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,700
who are worried about media attention or

1005
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,590
critical as a means of demonstrating

1006
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,270
accountability in openness and as the

1007
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:33,210
Commissioner with the jurisdiction in in

1008
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,100
Alberta you have mandatory breach

1009
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,540
notification so maybe you can tackle

1010
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,480
this question Jill well we have we have

1011
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,090
mandatory breach reporting to my office

1012
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,670
and then I have the ability to require

1013
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,950
organizations to notify individuals who

1014
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,390
have been who are at risk of significant

1015
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,640
harm as a result of that reach I do just

1016
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,540
want to follow up something that

1017
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,100
Commissioner started sooner about

1018
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,320
notification fatigue because I remember

1019
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,210
before Albert is law came in and you

1020
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,890
hear that all the time you know this is

1021
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,720
the problem with mandatory but I have

1022
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,120
never ever ever had anybody come up to

1023
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,190
me and say you know I got so many

1024
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,590
notifications of privacy breaches I'm

1025
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,720
really tired of getting these things has

1026
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,700
anybody ever said anything like that I

1027
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,560
don't think that's a real issue so

1028
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,390
mandatory breach notification is a total

1029
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,330
pain in the you-know-what sometimes yeah

1030
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,550
we we get a lot of these things and I

1031
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,530
know it's a lot of it's a lot of work

1032
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,030
for staff when a whole bunch of these

1033
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,520
things come in at the at at any given

1034
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,590
time all at once I'm saying in the

1035
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,120
session earlier today that we get about

1036
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,390
10 of them a month on average but it

1037
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,800
doesn't actually work out to 10 a month

1038
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,170
they don't come based like you're giving

1039
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,240
us some stats because the oilers haven't

1040
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,340
generated very much over tell Michael to

1041
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,980
stop emailing you put your blackberry

1042
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:56,490
away don't think I don't know what's

1043
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,600
going on here and I like stats everybody

1044
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,840
knows I likes tennis I know you do so it

1045
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,890
can be a total pain in the you-know-what

1046
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,490
but um ultimately and to some extent it

1047
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,260
is a mandatory breach notification is

1048
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,300
about those who are worried about media

1049
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,590
attention but you know we used to get

1050
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,660
self-reported breaches voluntarily all

1051
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,400
the time before there was a mandatory

1052
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,250
requirement in the legislation to report

1053
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,390
these things to us and that's because

1054
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,760
organizations want us to know ahead of

1055
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,860
time because somebody's going to find

1056
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,960
out the media is going to be all on it

1057
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,570
and they'll come to us and they'll say

1058
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,559
what do you know about this

1059
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:33,390
thing and so organizations have always

1060
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,630
reported well not all breaches but they

1061
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,339
have reported to us because they want us

1062
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,410
to know and they want to get some advice

1063
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,239
and guidance on dealing with the issue

1064
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:44,400
and they want to be able to respond to

1065
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,589
the media for sure and I'm okay with

1066
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:49,410
that but I do think that that breach

1067
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,920
reporting to us and certainly notifying

1068
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,259
individuals when individuals are at risk

1069
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:57,959
of harm from a bridge is absolutely

1070
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:59,910
critical and part of demonstrating

1071
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,920
accountability and openness and frankly

1072
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,660
just respect for your customers and your

1073
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,400
clients mean the point of notification

1074
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,890
is that individuals will be able to take

1075
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,619
steps to protect themselves and this

1076
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,089
part of control we've already spoken

1077
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:13,920
about control it's about openness it's

1078
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,719
about a transparency that's all of those

1079
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:18,719
things it's just the right thing to do

1080
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,259
in many cases so I think our experience

1081
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:24,359
with breach notification has been really

1082
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,949
positive i was saying again today that

1083
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:27,599
you know we're still learning where

1084
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,349
we've just passed the three-year mark

1085
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:32,969
having mandatory reporting to my office

1086
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:34,979
what i think is really encouraging is

1087
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:37,799
that you know these reports do come to

1088
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:40,049
the office and in an extremely high

1089
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:41,609
percentage of cases it's something like

1090
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:43,019
eighty percent of the time the

1091
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:44,789
notifications already happened so you

1092
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:46,469
only have to report to us if it's a real

1093
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:48,749
risk of significant harm if you've

1094
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:50,099
decided there's a real risk of

1095
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,809
significant harm and you need to report

1096
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:54,239
to me then chances are you've already

1097
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:55,859
talked to the individuals people are

1098
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,019
sending out notifications and i think

1099
00:50:58,019 --> 00:50:59,279
one of the the good things in the

1100
00:50:59,279 --> 00:51:01,799
legislation also is that it's fairly

1101
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:03,630
prescriptive in terms of what needs to

1102
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,979
be in a report to me but it's also

1103
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,749
prescriptive in terms of what needs to

1104
00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:08,910
go in the notification statement at a

1105
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,289
bare minimum you have to tell people

1106
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:11,880
certain things give them information

1107
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,709
about the incident what you're doing to

1108
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:16,380
to fix it so there's room for

1109
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,849
improvement I mean who knows what the

1110
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,039
next round will look like we'll probably

1111
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:22,469
have some suggestions it's still early

1112
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:24,239
days as we work through it but I think

1113
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:25,619
it's generally been a very positive

1114
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,199
thing we're getting a lot more where we

1115
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:29,999
have information we have knowledge and

1116
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:34,679
and data and trends and real-life cases

1117
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:37,339
we can go back to that we can turn into

1118
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:39,900
outreach efforts and guidance documents

1119
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,179
to help organizations to deal with these

1120
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:44,579
things and respond when and hopefully

1121
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:48,089
avoid some of these breaches Chris we

1122
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:49,709
also have mandatory breach notification

1123
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:53,189
and Ontario under P HIPAA we had it

1124
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:55,559
since 2004's are approaching 10 years

1125
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:57,869
very very successful but what's

1126
00:51:57,869 --> 00:51:58,829
interesting especially when you're

1127
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:01,439
dealing with patients we've worked we

1128
00:52:01,439 --> 00:52:02,729
always work with the healthcare

1129
00:52:02,729 --> 00:52:05,670
custodians to develop something that is

1130
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,589
not a one-size-fits-all when you're

1131
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:09,359
talking about patients and they just get

1132
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,249
a cold call letter in the mail notifying

1133
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:13,380
them of a breach relating their personal

1134
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,939
health information it's very very

1135
00:52:14,939 --> 00:52:16,619
stressful last thing you want to do is

1136
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,359
add to the stress of patients going

1137
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:21,539
through a health care crisis so we often

1138
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:23,699
work with physicians for example if

1139
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:25,199
they're going to have some of those

1140
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:27,239
patients involved or repeat patients

1141
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:28,589
that they see on a weekly basis for

1142
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,019
example then we draft a script with them

1143
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,880
that they can give verbally to the

1144
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,380
patient when they come in at their next

1145
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,719
visit and that is much less stressful

1146
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,059
for example then cold call letter you

1147
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,140
get in the mail and you don't know what

1148
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,809
to make of it in terms of thing how

1149
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:45,150
harmful is this so many ways to do it

1150
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,630
it's an invaluable tool and it can be

1151
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,039
done very creatively at times

1152
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,589
