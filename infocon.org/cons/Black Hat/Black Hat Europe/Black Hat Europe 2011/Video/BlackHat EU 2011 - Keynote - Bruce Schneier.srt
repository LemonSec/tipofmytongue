me more nervous

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,860
so I have been a question

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,050
does the other conference had better
giveaways than we do

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,090
has anyone checked

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,640
I mean it's like the the conference and
people doing surgery

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,800

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,280

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,380
for

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,380
about the class relates but let them
down there elsewhere in

19
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,250
but so I hello and I'm so I wanna talk
about

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,759
is cyberwar actually the the title the
talk aside more in the future cyber

21
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:29,560
conflict

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,890
and last june I participate in the
debate on side were in actual debate

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,340
there were signs that was between

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:43,299
was televised it was the proposition we
were debating is

25
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,659
the threat of cyber war has been grossly
exaggerated

26
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:50,439
sexy interesting proposition cousin said
thanks debating policy would be paying

27
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,470
language

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,770
and mean that itself is interesting
sheesh

29
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,950
and on I was undecided yes grossly
exaggerated

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,560
he was myself and Marc Rotenberg who's
the director of the Electronic Privacy

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,799
Information Center

32
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,060
on the other side was Mike McConnell
former head of the NSA currently works

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,289
Booz Allen Hamilton

34
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,770
and Jonathan Zittrain law professor at
at Harvard

35
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,270
%uh I thought it would be easy right I
had this list above side more

36
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,410
exaggerations

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,750
name so I take your they are looking to
gross exaggerations were done

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,470
%uh in fact we lost the debate i the
voting was interesting they %uh they

39
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,840
poll the audience the media today

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,970
and pull in the end the debate and the
side that change the most mines one

41
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,080
so we lost the end they more

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,430
people were convinced that we're not
exaggerate a cyberwar risk then

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,750
BR and I've been thinking about that

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,910
in the seven or eight months since that
today and actions come to understand

45
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,510
what's going on no why people don't
think we're exaggerating

46
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,709
the threats analysts the generations
which was pretty complete had Mike

47
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,950
McConnell himself saying is that the
washington post

48
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,870
the United States is fighting the site
work today and really losing

49
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,569
I had a US Senator talk about cyber
Katrina

50
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,060
I it's quotes about cyber Pearl Harbor
cyber 9/11

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,470
my favorite cyber army again a

52
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,409
had newspaper headlines about cuba
waging cyberwar

53
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,650
start on the independence hackers took
their side were on Australia

54
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,519
right side were so easy even kids can do
it on the iran who is a

55
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,879
up cypress tree adviser to President
Bush said

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,440
sexy great quotes cyber 9/11 has
happened over the last 10 years

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,239
but it's happened slowly so we don't see
its a

58
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,909
and even know what that means up I
learned up from a newspaper headlines in

59
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,780
germany attacks China for starting a
cyberwar

60
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,019
case you didn't know this side were
right now in Germany and China

61
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,420
up cyber with China declares war on
Western search sites to declare war in

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,159
companies now

63
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,580
that this country's a wall street
journal cyber bliss

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,330
I was a new one its US and Korea in

65
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,489
I'm each really clear regenerating the
stretch

66
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,030
and just look at some other examples
that

67
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,009
that we tend to use in talking about
cyber war the first one is a stone yet

68
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,620
this was April love 2007

69
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,470
and this tony was the victim of love a
bunch now service attacks the press talk

70
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,360
about that has been unprecedented

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,770
on the nagging you never seen before
that's all nonsense it was pretty much

72
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,490
a run-of-the-mill large-scale dial
service attack nothing new nothing

73
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,500
interesting

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,120
happen against the government's she
isn't on

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,900
example of the war by its like the enemy
army invaded your country

76
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,060
and they all run lines from you the post
office may access announcers jackie is

77
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,820
you can't get to do your stuff

78
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,020
a Russian was blamed for its they never
admitted its

79
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,110
so if you don't know who gets the only
person who is convicted

80
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,340
%uh these cyberattacks was

81
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,680
a 22-year-old Russian man living in
Thailand

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,530
who is in no way in about us a Russian
statue being pulled down

83
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,860
in Estonia it's a maybe side where is so
easy even kids can do it

84
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,139
October 2007 in the Serie A

85
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,240
and in that month I Israel launched a an
attack against

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,919
Syrian nuclear research center they any
bombed it

87
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,810
now this wasn't a cyberattack to use you
know these planes and bombs

88
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,919
but as a precursor to the attack

89
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,850
they up they hacked into the Syrian
radar in a defense systems

90
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,120
in an effort said you know that our
conceal getting an apt

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,889
this is not confirmed but it is pretty
much why they believed

92
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,039
that joe Manchin example uva saber
component a real attack

93
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,419
man so keep this in mind we talk about
Stuxnet few minutes

94
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,009
made this is a physical attack its
nuclear research center in Syria

95
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,960
using planes with a with a cyberattack
component to it

96
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,009
also in 2000 news instance in Brazil

97
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:19,250
this was used as the centerpiece for 60
minutes she misses the United States

98
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,000
a newsy television show on cyber war

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,979
and in that year there were several
blackouts

100
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,770
in in the country that have been blamed
on cyber attacks simply not actually

101
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,910
cyber extortionists

102
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,220
the story goes that somebody was able to
break in organization to break into the

103
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,500
power plants

104
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,979
demonstrating it shut power off and
extorted money

105
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,490
we don't know this is true even of they
actually got money we don't know

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,240
the other we know very little this one
news report I read that said it wasn't a

107
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,960
cyberattack Iowa City insulators

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,729
that cause the blackouts know people who
know stuff

109
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,979
tend to think yeah there was a cyber
thing going on

110
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,900
amid this has been used example a
cyberwar her

111
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,280
August 2008 in Georgia similar to
Estonia

112
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,509
there was up some large-scale data
service attacks

113
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:17,220
this time unlike us dona this percent an
actual land invasion

114
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,669
with the russians sent in troops and
tanks into estonia

115
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,110
again russia was blamed for the
cyberattacks they've never in any

116
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,410
responsibility

117
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,130
and and still we don't know ish if these
days with this was a

118
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,699
government-sponsored cyberattack

119
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,110
or if it was like a stony a kids playing
politics

120
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,970
man is something we see you relatively
regularly that there's some kinda

121
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,210
international tension and independent
hackers with a nationalistic streak

122
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,509
you know want to get involved in this is
what they do

123
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,060
so we don't know if there's an example a
cyberwar or just

124
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,099
cyber vigilantism or something like that

125
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,039
so thinking about these examples and we
talked with them in the debate June

126
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,370
the problem we have

127
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,620
in Jeff said this when he introduced me
is that there's no

128
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,000
good definition of war in cyberspace

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,240
they wanted the reasons we can't
determine if the risk has been grossly

130
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,520
exaggerated

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,490
do you know what the its its we all know
when it starts

132
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,990
we don't know what it looks like when
it's happening we don't know how to tell

133
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,539
when it's over

134
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:35,909
and it's not just newspaper headline
writers or government officials

135
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:42,269
even security experts don't have good
definitions of these things

136
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,279
and that makes the debate hard

137
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,279
but clearly we're not we're not actually
right now fighting a cyberwar

138
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,980
make clearly the charm is being used
more rhetorically

139
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,100
then actually

140
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,790
Maia and you americans have a really
weird relationship with the word

141
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,089
war we he using it when they're

142
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,060
actual wars we love using it

143
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,390
when there aren't wars Warren crime or
on drugs war on terror war on poverty

144
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,959
we love rhetorical wars my it makes a
sound I don't know I'm

145
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,339
ditsy making some big but in this case
it's also damaging

146
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:30,580
make that the war rhetoric

147
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,630
being overly broadly applied

148
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,950
has actually some serious policy
consequences of talk about them later

149
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,000
so i think is going on is one sentence

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,850
that you gonna write down from this talk
this is it so get ready

151
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,130
it's not they were fighting a cyberwar
but

152
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,130
that we are increasingly seeing warlike
tactics

153
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,190
used and water cyber conflicts

154
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,860
thats the problem he used to be

155
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,860
there was a set of things we would call
war that only nations were able to do

156
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,450
but in cyberspace the capabilities are
being diffused Rugby through the

157
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,930
population

158
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,750
so nine nations can now employed

159
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,970
war like tactics

160
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,380
like a buncha criminals getting a tank
now what do you do

161
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,649
the biggest tanks used to be the sole
purview

162
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:35,760
up governments military's in

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,360
technology is broadly spreading
capability

164
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,720
sheesh certain now that we have a better
definition that we're talking about

165
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,180
these more broad cyber complex

166
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,420
let's look at some other examples that
said something fit into what people call

167
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,130
in cyber war and some don't

168
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,360
but they're all fit into these broads
have a conflict idea

169
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,260
so go snatch is a good example
discovered in March 09

170
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,769
on this is a very large widespread well
put together surveillance network

171
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,250
but it was discovered when some security
researchers were cleaning up the Dalai

172
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,279
Lama's computers

173
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,120
and as they rolled up this network they
found it was targeting

174
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,870
knowledge Dalai Lama political economic
media targets

175
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,000
in about a hundred different countries
you look at the list of targets is

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,850
basically a who's who love

177
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,110
who China once spy on so of course

178
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,149
China is believed to be the perpetrator
a ghost nets

179
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,620
up now it's embassies its foreign
ministries its government offices

180
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,540
its I was actually a really impressive
surveillance network

181
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,779
new China course never did anything so
should we actually don't know

182
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,700
i July 09 their attacks against South
Korea and the United States

183
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,320
now question you hear the victims being
South Korean the US you really think

184
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,550
North Korea is the

185
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,139
at the perpetrator the tracing we're
able to do

186
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:09,130
show that the attacks came from a in

187
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,230
for me there's China or London or
Florida

188
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,690
the i mean there are some US congressman

189
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,500
who wanted us to attack back you know
kinetically with real-life weapons

190
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,829
with an awkward it was Florida him

191
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,639
a January of last year Google announced
they were the victim a very a

192
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,320
organized cyber attacks from China

193
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,470
after just two steel email accounts

194
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,529
drum chinese dissidents another's now
that she's trying to plug the country

195
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,720
because it that I again China has never

196
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,430
never admit it we show and it's so
common theme a half right you know we

197
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,740
don't know who doesn't

198
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,040
we don't know who does it again and
again we don't know who does it

199
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,430
a few more broadly there've been attacks
emanating from China

200
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,570
against a wide variety of government and
corporate sites and this has been going

201
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,839
on for years

202
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,110
in those who study this believed that
it's not for

203
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,490
the Chinese government's that is
directing these attacks

204
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,990
but more that its independence hackers
in China

205
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,459
who works hola raided by the government
schism tacit understanding in hackers in

206
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,610
the government that the hatch cover Lee
the hackers alone hackers try something

207
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,970
cool it s next government

208
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,130
message was not government same shoes as
government tolerated

209
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,560
in a sense I I think this is a little
more on stabilizing

210
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,010
italy's government shore strange no
independent actors

211
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,040
make sure less restraint

212
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,800
man that's been been going on for years
and still ongoing

213
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,070
a more recent example %uh mean we all
know that Stuxnet

214
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,490
discovered in June last year made
Stuxnet

215
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,959
is a very well designed very well
written very well

216
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,490
executed very targeted were

217
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,050
targeted against and Iranian nuclear
enrichment facility

218
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,060
targeted against a specific centrifuge

219
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,550
inside that Iranian nuclear climate
facility

220
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,550
seems to have an effective

221
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,820
game we don't know for sure now that you
know the

222
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,180
when it first appeared as a lot of
speculation on what the target was I was

223
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,209
skeptical first time convince now

224
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,480
has been some great investigative
reporting about Stuxnet

225
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,800
in various magazines and newspapers up

226
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,139
me know and once you believe the targets
there and you

227
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:42,130
Emilie believe that the %uh perpetrator
is the US or Israel

228
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,040
and we now believe that it was both the
US and Israel

229
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,769
that that launched upset against Iran

230
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:55,079
and you can read about some other design
work in the testing work they tested on

231
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,449
actual facilities it really is an
impressive work

232
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,930
you're worth worth reading about worth
studying

233
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,029
%uh you know compare this a decision
Paris into what the Israel did

234
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,029
Syria in 2007

235
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,220
right in the first case they attacked
nuclear power plant with

236
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,339
airplanes the second place they used USB
sticks

237
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,500
me if someone is an active war the other
one is to

238
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,490
and if one isn't the other one is it's
certainly using bombs at the had paid

239
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,940
more collateral damage

240
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,029
in terms of lives lost using USB sticks
had more collateral damage in terms of

241
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,699
computers infected

242
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,310
you know so that we know is so we we
gassed see that

243
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,870
the country might have a choice a tactic
depending on what it said

244
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,509
but its aims are also along the lines of
a politically-motivated

245
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:54,610
attacking I think we should look at some
other things that happens in the last

246
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,130
couple %uh United States elections

247
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,779
we might is might happen elsewhere the
world I know United States best

248
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,670
and we saw up quite a bit a political
hacking

249
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,160
you not by candidates not by parties but
by

250
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,630
individuals who supported candidates or
parties

251
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,320
so we had candidates web sites that they
stand and now serves a taxed

252
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,630
we had US three years ago Sarah Palin's
by special candidates

253
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,660
her email pac-10

254
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,790
night more recently we see email hacks
against the

255
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,170
a climate change scientists

256
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,740
me and this is all cyber attacks
designed to

257
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,889
changed political landscape me actually
the very high ames

258
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,910
November this year in Burma in in what
passes for elections next country

259
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,420
they were serious cyber attacks designed
to disrupt the election

260
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:00,420
we do know by Julia know why but they
did happen

261
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,040
J and although im not sure if thats

262
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,820
I think about WikiLeaks and you know
less WikiLeaks

263
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,520
as you know as WikiLeaks and more the
idea of WikiLeaks which which you know

264
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,339
could be any

265
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,080
name of the website you in some ways
that's nothing new for any of us

266
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,040
you imagine if you like the US State
Department is fine you learned with the

267
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,620
music and movie industry learned ten
years ago

268
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,540
that its are comparable a

269
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,360
right now and I and and dean at the wiki
leaks that that exist

270
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,690
the guy could dream up a bit orange me
in one's bits are copied and distributed

271
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,380
you can't get them back is there a lotta
lessons here about the the nature of

272
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,220
secrecy

273
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,520
in the information age it's kinda
difference

274
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,210
by WikiLeaks has a phenomenon is
definitely

275
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,450
an organization they're using

276
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,120
cyberspace to change politics me not
using cyberattacks just using

277
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,580
publication man and lastly i think is a
really interesting example is

278
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,040
is anonymous verses HB Gary me

279
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,200
in hand you're so here we are ago you
know what we've come from

280
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,550
government versus governments shootin'

281
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,480
a bunch of individuals versus a
corporation

282
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,100
and an anonymous tip quite a number on
HP gary is really quite impressive

283
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,380
you know that at that

284
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,400
a small group both determined smart

285
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,280
individuals can mistakenly take down a
security company

286
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,190
can have a different world when that's
chip

287
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,070
an awesome evolution and what's what
happened in in Egypt and some the other

288
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,020
Arab countries

289
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,780
where approaches using the are using the
internet to

290
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,200
but we get organized in the government
in response try to shut the internet

291
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,930
down

292
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,630
is an interesting response it didn't
actually work

293
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:13,150
and its only place its even only do that
if you have crappy name destruction

294
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,240
by if this is one telco in your country

295
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,460
and its owned by the president's brother
its kinda easy to

296
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,660
you had to say can you please turn that
off for a day or two please

297
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,550
you know if you have a robust
infrastructure with many companies and

298
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,010
many access points

299
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,870
you can't do that but no service we
serve so I happen to him

300
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,080
mood problems you happen again this year
in

301
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,300
osha to older examples I i wanna talk
about

302
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,200
up in times interview that about a month
ago by up

303
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,060
by Russian magazine about cyber war
should and whether things are poor

304
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,510
asked me is why is russia considered the
bad guy in this

305
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,770
I the blame us for stone a blame us for
Georgia

306
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,140
why only the bad guy sheesh and I said
that eat you're not

307
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,920
used for a dozen russia was actually the
first

308
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,280
victor way back in 1982

309
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,650
the United States s insert malicious
code

310
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,020
in Canadian software that was sent to
Russia

311
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,240
to help control the trans-siberian
pipeline

312
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,050
the the resulting explosion I believe is
still largest non-nuclear

313
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,060
explosion on our planet's me

314
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,680
and and you and this was a cyberattack
how is it different than Stuxnet

315
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,100
sounds like the same think in

316
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,940
IPO's 30 years previously in 1991 in
this story is is also

317
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,160
unconfirmed but widely believed by the
United States insert malicious code in

318
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,060
printers

319
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,620
they were being sent to Iraq this is
before the first Gulf War

320
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,980
and that malicious code no

321
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,850
ethically damage the iraqi air defense
system making it easier for US and I

322
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,580
think we know whatever coalition was

323
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,100
warplanes to attack iraq this is in
response to the invasion of kuwait

324
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,150
in

325
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,620
me to this Melissa stories and when you
think about them me

326
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,730
you did that that the huge difference in
in not only perpetrators targets and

327
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,910
tactics

328
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:37,450
you know the the the the spread of what
could be considered cyberwar cyber

329
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,330
conflict

330
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,370
certainly very very large n

331
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,210
just think that response for seconds
when

332
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,470
your its hacked in cyberspace

333
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,220
there's a variety of ways you can defend
yourself the right

334
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,770
institutions you can call on for defense

335
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,820
right you can call on the police

336
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,170
you call the military you can call on

337
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,840
whatever organization does Cara
terrorism

338
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,080
you can call on us setup products and
services you've purchased

339
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,550
you can call on your corporate lawyers

340
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,230
and the particular legal regime

341
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,620
right real framework for any particular
defense depends on two things:

342
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,680
who's attacking you and why

343
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,740
and in cyberspace when you're attacked
the

344
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,940
should do things you don't know are
who's attacking you

345
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,210
and why that makes defense

346
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,960
difficult witness tony is the victim 08
now service tax they don't know

347
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,490
his Russia or some guy in an apartment
somewhere

348
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,930
I it makes a difference but you don't

349
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,420
no in

350
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,210
me to thinking all the different
adversaries we talk about our examples

351
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,750
are we talked about hackers we talk
about criminals financially motivated

352
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,480
attackers

353
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,680
we talked about politically motivated
attackers we talk about spice

354
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,760
we didn't talk about big imagining that
terrorists we talked about governments

355
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,650
militaries

356
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,130
met the the perpetrators run the gamut

357
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,150
each from unsophisticated educated from
fully funded to wealth funds are

358
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,390
done risk averse to risk averse and
their all

359
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,880
use in the same tactics in

360
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,580
make you can't tell when you're at the
receiving end

361
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,060
in

362
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,310
went just think about the tactic try
these will be using data theft

363
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,140
eavesdropping data manipulation the Nile
service

364
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,110
sabotage read these are all tools

365
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,890
love all those different attackers

366
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,810
i the difference is the motivation

367
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,350
little think his side note on Sun
sabotage

368
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,570
37 against networks and this is widely
misunderstood

369
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,500
in in in people who think about cyber
war up

370
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,400
in a war destroying just destroying the
enemy's communications network

371
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,940
is the least good thing you can do with
it

372
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,160
make the best thing you can do is
control which

373
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,380
selectively and delete messages that's
the best

374
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,470
really messed something up doing that

375
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,770
if you can't do that the second best
thing

376
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,670
is eavesdropping on its passively
listening

377
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,060
that's very very valuable

378
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:55,620
only if you can't do that the least good
thing you can do is destroy it

379
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,440
my but it's definitely not your first
choice not even your second choice

380
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,480
miss a little aside their

381
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,390
such a look at these attacks

382
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,960
are examples above what we started a
call

383
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,640
the advanced persistent threat APT

384
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,010
I generally heat buzzwords the heat new
buzzwords

385
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:22,820
but you know I'm coming around to this
one it's not new

386
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,030
it's the idea that

387
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,740
the the hackers the enemy the bad guy
when it caught

388
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,310
wants to get into you and they're gonna
head

389
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:37,780
use a variety of methods and techniques
until they get it

390
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,020
writes itself unlike the criminal
threats by the criminal once

391
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,970
I'm making this up 100000 credit card
numbers as in can we get some truck

392
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,210
so you can defend yourself he said to be
you know more secure than the other guy

393
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,360
and you're fine made but if it's you
know anonymous racist

394
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,179
HB Gary an honest ones in

395
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:02,380
to HB Gary not anybody

396
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,530
and they're gonna keep working until
they do it

397
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,580
this is a real threat again it's not new
but but it's not a big buzzword

398
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,000
in and you know on the internets

399
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,929
the advantage goes the attacker

400
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:23,360
mean not after all time actually now

401
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,080
yeah and manager thing at this year's
issue warfare that this bounces back and

402
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,890
forth

403
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,650
chart my alley nice think about

404
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,510
the US Civil War the attacker had the
advantage because

405
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,440
weapons are powerful known how to defend
themselves to be we liming lining up in

406
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,240
rows

407
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,840
like they did in in olden times the gym
shooting at each other and and

408
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,910
be would I sheesh it wasn't on the
police investigate out

409
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,610
offense a tactics in the age of rifles
that

410
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,940
you know that that that the that the
pension check defended manage

411
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,160
for and then the police got the attacker
then search

412
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,270
right and that stayed the same into
weapons got better again

413
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,490
into World War one and defenders had the
advantage trench warfare

414
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,690
you were pretty safe miss you stick your
head up a charge which case United

415
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,730
and and United million wasn't old World
War two and hit there who figured out

416
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,570
how to use tanks

417
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,210
and that the blue screen work there that
we again saw

418
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,800
the attacker had the advantage say so as
technologies change

419
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,810
you know that goes back and forth over
the span of a couple centuries

420
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,140
you right now on the internet the
attacker has the advantage

421
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,669
i mean you know that if someone wanted
to get in they would get it

422
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:43,400
it might take a while but in no way is
perfectly secure

423
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,360
it's just a matter of time and effort
but that's the way it is

424
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,410
so this advanced persistent threat is
real and its

425
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,560
its affective writing it's gonna work

426
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,600
and how we deal it is is is worth
talking about in

427
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,140
and most defining mm find politically
motivated happened packing

428
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,340
but I find politically very broadly

429
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,910
rights nationalistic its ethical its
religious

430
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,730
a the the targets could be governments

431
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,940
could be corporations may we've seen
politically motivated hacking

432
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,650
against up a good against companies
include the charge industries

433
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,970
oil companies pharmaceutical companies
Microsoft

434
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,460
made against institutions against
individuals

435
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,460
made these you can all be targets in

436
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,780
still wanna talk about the politics a
cyberwar the world is gearing up for

437
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,420
cyber war we make no mistake

438
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,570
even as even as she know we go about our
day

439
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,850
countries are preparing for cyber war
the US Cyber Command

440
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,640
azo sometime last year became fully
operational

441
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,630
whatever that actually means the UK has

442
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,920
talked a lot about this cyber capability
made 0

443
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,200
has talked about their cyber capability
China

444
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,320
makes a big deal in their doctoral
material

445
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,750
about controlling cyberspace any broader
conflict

446
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,390
other countries I mean this isn't a bad
thing

447
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,549
ready to war expands to fill all
available theaters

448
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:32,200
land sea airspace and now cyberspace

449
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,760
and any future war will have a
cyberspace components

450
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,990
and it makes sense for countries to
prepare for that

451
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,919
mean just as you know in in the US
forces in Iraq

452
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,080
we saw an air war preceding a ground war
you could easily see the next time the

453
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,260
US and they'd somebody for cyber war

454
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,100
receive an air war should a ground war
made you know that's just as pressure

455
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,360
reasonable up

456
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,370
progression up tak up attacks

457
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,179
so it's a country thing would be to
derelict in their duty as nation-states

458
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:11,250
if they didn't have a cyber command's up

459
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,750
but there is you know in this broader
cyber conflict

460
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,580
it's less clear where the detention
beach

461
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,480
and this is a power struggle going on in
countries over this

462
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,049
you know i watch the United States is
between the FBI

463
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:31,040
and the DHS and the DOD

464
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,700
over who controls national defense in
cyberspace

465
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,490
and there were congressional hearings
and there was debates

466
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,600
and the DOD 1 the FBI lost DHS lost

467
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,890
and the US Cyber Command his co located

468
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:53,150
with the NSA at Fort Meade the headed
the US Cyber Command is the head and the

469
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,550
NSAC kind and no one here

470
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,730
made in this is a struggle

471
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,669
for it for the power for the budget
session

472
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,679
in the US the the the DOD one

473
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,620
is also a power struggle in government
in and Kenny corporations

474
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,610
over who controls security critical
infrastructure

475
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:21,540
right now in the US the corporation seem
to have one so far

476
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,120
and how long they can hold outs in

477
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,760
we'll talk a bit about more about that
later made it is the whole

478
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,090
security versus privacy power struggle
which I i thought i evening 119 is a red

479
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,550
herring

480
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:43,550
the real debates Liberty versus control
and here is where the metaphors manner

481
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:48,710
me here's where using the rule war
rhetoric

482
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,110
get you in trouble rate because to the
police

483
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:58,900
we're all citizens to protect to the
military

484
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:05,600
we are a population to be subdued using
the war metaphor

485
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,679
reinforces the notion that we are
helpless

486
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,990
maybe war doesn't mean we deal with we
let we let the government deal with that

487
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,110
that's not our problem

488
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:19,550
you don't worry about it we don't defend
against maybe just stand back and docs

489
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:24,100
night so if we use the war metaphor

490
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,150
we need others to protect us we can't do
it ourselves

491
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,600
man and he just sees our fears

492
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,700
there when you look at

493
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,290
the different defense tactics being
proposed in various countries to deal

494
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,750
with the cyber war threats

495
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,150
you see the metaphor matters a lot

496
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,630
now we just talked about

497
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,730
the the notion a military-controlled

498
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,590
over over the Internet backbone

499
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,620
over up prelim structure like the power
grid

500
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,140
over protocols and technologies

501
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,130
the thing about summer the wholesale
surveillance we so I mean certainly in

502
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,350
the US but you can countries to

503
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,150
you know but when the year december 11th
is

504
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,570
the NSA what in the eighteen see it all
come his offices and said hi

505
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:23,330
we want the eavesdropping everybody and
instead at the AT&T saying

506
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,960
you can't do that that's illegal 18 he
said sure here use that closet over

507
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,820
there just lock the door when you done

508
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:40,550
maybe that's that's something you do in
wartime but not in peacetime

509
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,550
may just like during world war 2 the
president's

510
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:48,500
United States said the Chrysler start
building cars start building takes in

511
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,190
chrysler said yes sir

512
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,700
my because we were a nation at war

513
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,350
you never do that peacetime

514
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,960
or some other the debate any shopping
facilitation

515
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,960
the debate happening in many countries I
can talk mostly about the US United

516
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,510
States

517
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,359
%uh thing 2003 we passed a law

518
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,810
hold kaliya and I forget what it stands
for but basically it's a law that says

519
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,389
the phone companies have to make

520
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,540
phone calls eavesdrops eavesdropper
friendly

521
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,159
so they at throughout most the tissue
the telephone

522
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,889
industry up the government's the police
wanted to ease up on a phone call

523
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,230
they would drive to the phone switch may
open up the case

524
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,339
find the correct phone line connection
weights in the New Year with a with a

525
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,770
reporter Anna

526
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,139
headset would listen that work great

527
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,980
with modern packet-switched networks you
can't do that

528
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,030
me there isn't the same easy way to
eavesdrop

529
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,630
this annoyed the FBI they went to
congress and said

530
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,750
make the phone companies thinks that

531
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,310
night fix that problem bars Congress
passed a law and now in the US

532
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,330
the the phone the phones which
manufactures

533
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,490
deliberately make their systems

534
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,430
eased up on I think it's a massive in
securing the reading but that's the

535
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,339
lowest

536
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:21,240
so last year and at last year and this
year

537
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,130
the FBI and once the you to extend that
capability

538
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,810
to all communication systems

539
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,109
because more and more but less and less
communication happens over the phone

540
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:35,530
network

541
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,780
right the a they worried about Skype

542
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:45,390
basically but the law is broad enough to
apply to everything

543
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:52,250
from Skype see email to the chat window
in Second Life

544
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,839
now depending on the technology making
it eavesdropping family runs from

545
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,030
easy to impossible maybe think it's not
like Gmail that's easy

546
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,150
the may because the email exists in the
clear on Google servers

547
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,369
and the FBI know who will win the
primary papers and say we want his email

548
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,990
and in fact Google maintains an office
to deal with those requests from the US

549
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,940
and other countries

550
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,030
in made to deal with requests from the
government's

551
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,010
for the email %uh up various people they
can do that now

552
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,050
no change required he go again you're
into Skype

553
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,230
where it's impossible for Skype to do
that

554
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,720
your Skype holes encrypt it on your
machine

555
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,810
depicted on the other end and there's no
place in the middle to eavesdrop on

556
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,970
you can't we designed the system yet the
rip it down and build a new

557
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,680
less secure one in order to make that
work

558
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,760
the other systems somewhere in the
middle

559
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,930
so this is not a lawyer at this is still
being debated

560
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,710
now there is a bill you know and and and
as these things meander through it may

561
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,420
or may not happen

562
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,660
up but there have been no up

563
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,890
broader debates in and what a country's
about BlackBerry's

564
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,780
made last year was your most recently
the government's a Saudi Arabia

565
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,300
and United Arab Emirates set the
BlackBerry you know we can't you shop on

566
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,339
this is annoying %uh sticks patch

567
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,740
blackberry said we can't possibly fix
that you know and they gave a whole

568
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,920
buncha reasons

569
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,540
up government subsidy Arabia and the UAE
said bullshit

570
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:40,069
into Russia and China India said hey you
should be addressed to

571
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:43,920
and you know what we're in is doing is
there they say they're moving their

572
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,500
servers around

573
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,810
up the countries are less worried about
corporate BlackBerry users

574
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,760
and more that individual BlackBerry
users

575
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,010
man and blackberry traffic is encrypted
from the handset to the for server

576
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,650
sovereign is doing is they they put a
server in saudi arabia

577
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,750
so now the government use drop on on
their stuff you know they've done this

578
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,670
the US as well

579
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,970
make it so here again up countries
you're asking technology firms to

580
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,510
deliberately we design their systems

581
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,920
to make me shopping easier

582
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,660
up nother tactic is the data retention
laws me it was the one in Germany now

583
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,319
and they're being talked about many
places

584
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:32,810
forcing ISP's to say he used

585
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:38,370
internet data on their customers that
can be used to facilitate

586
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:44,080
a surveillance made from was a major
issue 1 years miss you two years depends

587
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,710
on the country fans in lebanon the bill

588
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,160
now we have we seen debates the United
States is debate right now I internet on

589
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,670
the internet kill switch

590
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,310
made should there be an ability miss it
sounds crazy when I talk about it should

591
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,780
we design in the ability to shut the
unit of

592
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,040
I mean you know this is def this is the
definition upjohn

593
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,390
and I don't know it yup it's hard to
tell exactly how would the bid

594
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,550
the lawmakers propose want it to work
mean I i cant condition is a big red

595
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,190
button on the president's desk assess
just stop internet now

596
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,410
and you can press it never goes away or
maybe est call somebody and say to press

597
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,720
the button max

598
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,990
I don't know my buddy us running a very
dangerous thing but surely talked about

599
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,710
and sand and machine gun

600
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,010
in some countries either holier
selectively

601
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,859
some is they want to be able to shut off
a country like stop Internet traffic

602
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,560
from from this country

603
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,609
or from that IP address meso that stuff
we we

604
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:51,170
weed so do normally with the political
spin some it stuff he couldn't imagine

605
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,290
doing

606
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,030
are also seeing other proposals for

607
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,420
action inlet action bution laws the idea
is that

608
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,550
anonymity and unit is bad

609
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,160
then you should listen on the examples I
gave that these it's ever complex a

610
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,859
cyberwar

611
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,880
we don't know who did it we don't know
who did it we don't be consciously don't

612
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,970
know who did it

613
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,990
so people say well I got a great idea
let's make sure we know who did it

614
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:23,010
right but of course here we need anyway
here knows this is impossible is never

615
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,740
going to work

616
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:29,440
but you are seeing these calls the and
anonymity on the internet

617
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,730
that if we just did that we'll be able
to know with the bad guys are we just

618
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,140
arrest them when that BZ

619
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,150
if they were on the trip

620
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,150
but you know changed in these debates

621
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,069
is the notion that we are at war

622
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:49,670
man alive these measures you might make
sense to work time

623
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:56,130
but they really do make us less safe in
peacetime

624
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,480
so depending on the rhetorics to use

625
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,819
and the rhetoric the government takes
steps

626
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:06,319
you get it different solution space

627
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,000
make a difference said options become
politically viable

628
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,870
and this is the date the warmongers are
winning

629
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,230
Mid Sussex talk a bit about the future
of

630
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,290
on the saffir complex mean certainly we
need to be prepared for war as I said

631
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,120
earlier

632
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,250
up yup Cyber Command is essential that
you get with that

633
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,350
countries do need a Cyber Command
because anymore

634
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:40,630
will include a cyberspace components and
and also critical is the date

635
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:45,500
on shoes six years critical
infrastructure

636
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:52,140
yeah and what points what can the market
do and what does government have to do

637
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,240
when you deal with common defense you
very regularly get market failures

638
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,730
this is why even libertarians agree that

639
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:05,120
you need a common defense a military or
police

640
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,960
just thinking that the other day
simplest examples are match in a a a

641
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,300
chemical company they own a plant's it's
near some population center as it

642
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,280
explodes watch much people die

643
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,680
I took there's is a big risk their

644
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,569
the chemical company will secure that
plants

645
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:28,350
up to the value %uh its to the chemical
company

646
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:32,430
at best they'll secure its up to the
value

647
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,160
%uh the chemical company because there's
no greater Los then going out of

648
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,950
business

649
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,940
any residual risk needs to be secured

650
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:50,940
by a public institution because there's
no way for the market to get there

651
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,510
right there isn't any mechanism

652
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,760
jet to do that without government
intervention now

653
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,080
yup did and these are market failures
are everywhere in security

654
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,589
and depending on your politics you my
pic regulation

655
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:10,400
or subsidy a government takeover I
actually don't care

656
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,660
right that's politics but from a
security perspective

657
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,970
you need some governments handle

658
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,270
that and their are critical
infrastructure risks

659
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,400
that are beyond the scope on the
company's that on the criminal structure

660
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,370
it's very clear and the debate on how to
secure these i think is important to

661
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,940
have

662
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,780
up we need discussion on

663
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,400
the characteristics cyberwar

664
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,530
is not a lot of thinking about what
cyber world looks like

665
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,950
a this is a fundamental asymmetry in sac
or

666
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,620
at some countries are naturally six-year

667
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,040
and summer naturally vulnerable

668
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,050
I think about North Korea first United
States

669
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,430
north Korea has what 10 computers

670
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,530
it's really hard to attack them in
cyberspace

671
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,160
prison have much cyberspace

672
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,260
compare that to the US which relies very
heavily

673
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,680
in critical ways on cyberspace

674
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,310
the US is naturally vulnerable in
cyberspace

675
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,440
simply because how they use its again
this isn't new

676
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,359
greatly in their countries that because
if they're their mountainous terrain are

677
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,060
naturally

678
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,790
safer against the land war well because
I love you know they're they're sea

679
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,160
borders are nationally safer against

680
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,310
up and other a notion Warner in other
countries are more vulnerable and land

681
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,980
rights era in the action me

682
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:44,160
we already know that terrain gives
countries advantages and disadvantages

683
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,020
different theaters cyberspace is no
difference

684
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,540
so there are asymmetries that were
thinking about

685
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,720
there's the fundamental a synergy
attackers defense it is much easier to

686
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,190
attack and defend

687
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:03,339
main in a lot of ways is similar to its
nuclear war

688
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:07,130
right where where the the attack was
everything the defense was nothing

689
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,359
that you couldn't defend yet as holes
said a doctrine

690
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,810
based on that fact

691
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,319
that there was no such thing as the
fancy was all attack

692
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,980
up deal with the fact that weapons don't
come with the return address

693
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:29,290
I with Israel attacked Syria assurance
can look up she was paid on the back at

694
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,940
the airplanes and saili Israel

695
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,950
it when Iran must have attack by Israel

696
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:40,970
vs Stuxnet Iran couldn't look up
anything

697
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,180
made they couldn't know who did it ish
now perhaps

698
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,049
Israel told them in some diplomatic
back-channel hey that's us haha

699
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:53,630
night maybe they didn't mean they could
have written something in the worm that

700
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,700
said you know

701
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,190
this is real haha but you know the cause
anybody could do that I'd really

702
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,240
disputes that

703
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,319
you cyber weapons don't have the same
attribution

704
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,520
that regular weapons hatch this is this
a problem in rules of warfare States

705
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,819
that your weapons need to be attributed
to your soldiers wear uniforms

706
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:21,960
your tanks are painted your colors and
this is not just so you know they miss

707
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,670
couple reasons for this visit

708
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,690
old doctrine up

709
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,520
it helps prevent friendly-fire right you
know who is on your side chair shoot

710
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,839
them

711
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,020
also lets the enemy No

712
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,600
the whose military and who civilian

713
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,960
because wars are fought between
military's

714
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,670
and someone not in uniform is a
non-combatants

715
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,310
where someone you form is a commands and
there's rid their different rules

716
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,100
is one the reasons why guerrilla war so
hard for countries

717
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,130
because in guerrilla wars is the river's
edge between

718
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:03,000
combat and non-combat as well blurs hand
which

719
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,620
terrible thats we don't know what to do

720
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,850
we're better off that we were much
better at fighting armies that

721
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:14,260
act like armies

722
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,120
I think when you start walking away
about cyber war treaties

723
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,210
it is an extension book up it's called

724
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,310
cyberwar it written by Richard Clark %uh
is

725
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,640
use another cybersecurity adviser under
president bush

726
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,670
%uh the first hand for the it's a tough
pill to talk about

727
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,770
the first half the book is terrible it's
just cyber warring

728
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,010
hype an exaggeration don't read it

729
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,920
second if the book talks about treaties
and things to do it's great

730
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,750
read it mates as a hard book to review

731
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,470
he spends a lot of time on cyber war
treaties

732
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:55,180
how they might look up

733
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,130
how they are similar and different too
much a nuclear treaties

734
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,120
what international organizations might
negotiate these treaties how they might

735
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,100
look

736
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,580
how they might work up

737
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,060
you know there are user examples of
things you might consider

738
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,290
under international treaties no first
use a cyber weapons that that sounds

739
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,880
like a good one

740
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,730
up minimisation of collateral damage

741
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,819
could be something in one a treaty not
know I have no attacks

742
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:29,049
up against civilian targets in
infrastructure think it's a good idea

743
00:48:29,049 --> 00:48:34,690
or even better know unnamed weapons

744
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,670
the weapons need to self-destruct the
head at the end a conflict

745
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,750
I it's a good idea stocks that actually
will self destruct

746
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,910
sometime after 1 month to month into a
next year

747
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,500
stocks that is a program to
self-destruct

748
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,319
so they really separate and dates into
that weapon or or that all

749
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:57,150
made all 11 did you identify and we can
imagine some some international digital

750
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,950
signature protocol

751
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:05,830
right you know you think about cyber or
treaties in the first question you have

752
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,660
is had we possibly verify any of these

753
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,609
and and Clark's book talks about this
and he made some really good points

754
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:16,620
that treaties are valuable in their
negotiation and signing

755
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,790
even if they're occasion

756
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,850
is impossible and the trees had value

757
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:26,970
and certainly enough thing about nuclear
treaties are chemical trees are

758
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,150
biological trees

759
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,760
there been reaches all over the world

760
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,330
and cyber or treat you like to be easier
reach me at you are you are you realize

761
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,730
how hard it is

762
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,730
where eggs how easy it is for a country
to hide

763
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,270
a chemical weapons facility from from
inspectors

764
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,299
think it how much easy it would be to
hide a

765
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:49,740
cyber weapons facility

766
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,970
right it could be in some guys basement

767
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,640
an AI and you never know

768
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,620
so surely me discussion there up right
now that is some chocolates I portray

769
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,040
decided I'm singing the past six months

770
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,000
conferences and meetings about that
outside or treaties

771
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,160
in nationalization looking at surprising
and now this is actually right now being

772
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,240
blocked by the United States

773
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,589
I think there's a belief in the US
government that that we have some

774
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:19,510
advantage

775
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:24,500
in cyber war right now and that treaty
would squander that advantage

776
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,160
so we don't want we want to slow that
process down makes no sense to me but

777
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,970
me know I'm not charge

778
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,500
but really a man is important you know
we are right now in the early years

779
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,100
beside your arms race

780
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,520
and I don't think that's good for
anybody

781
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,609
new Eminem fuels an arms race is
ignorance

782
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:53,210
me you know I don't know what you're
doing

783
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,140
so I assume the worst and respond
accordingly

784
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,029
you don't know what I'm doing so you
have to assume the worst

785
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:05,710
and respond accordingly and then that
she was going until we have watchin does

786
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,510
nuclear warheads each

787
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:16,660
me too anything that dampens cyberwar
arms race is a good thing

788
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,470
even something as simple as simple as a
a as a hotline

789
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:26,319
between given cyber command's especially
for sign is seen on nation state actors

790
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,170
it be great if the US Cyber Command
caught the russians at me and say hey is

791
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,850
that you in Russian as I know it's not
as I know it is either

792
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:38,330
they have little conversation that
sounds like it could be valuable

793
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,270
in dealing with the nine nations that
actors that a good definitely gonna suck

794
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,279
popping up

795
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:49,190
with these cyber war capabilities

796
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,650
we also need to decide what an offensive
action is

797
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:57,770
in cyberspace ever and is again in
actions right from from

798
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:01,430
from benign to definitely offensive
right is defending yourself let me know

799
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,880
that's that's okay

800
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,390
eavesdropping you know a little
offensive what's been happening for for

801
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,510
centuries not gonna stop so that that
certainly allowed in peacetime

802
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:15,359
%uh building up attack capabilities you
know I guess building weapons is OK

803
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,549
no getting crossing the line is a legal
preparing the battlefield

804
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:24,640
and this is a doctrine by which you can
go into a potential enemy strange

805
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,000
and not do offensive things but prepare

806
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,950
for doing offensive things right
reconnaissance

807
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,140
occasionally leaving caches up supplies

808
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,049
under the doctor preparing the
battlefield up

809
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:44,880
we pretty much know that both the US and
China had minimal change those networks

810
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,140
and leaving logic bombs not detonating
them

811
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,250
but leaving them there

812
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,640
this feels bad to me

813
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,150
maybe you were told that some other
country know what did your capital city

814
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,069
in buried some bombs places

815
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:08,970
you'd be annoyed right you'd say that's
not okay you can't do that

816
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,930
we are doing and cyberspace there's
these risks year

817
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,060
is rich something goes off on
unintentionally

818
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,910
his wrist things go out of hand

819
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,319
right not only is it is it bad policy
and he's dangerous policy

820
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,100
and then over here in our in a benign to
offensive actions are things like

821
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,069
Stuxnet

822
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:31,760
you're definitely offense

823
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,310
which certainly by any reasonable
definition would be considered active

824
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,640
war

825
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,089
so he is so right you know where the
line is

826
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:46,490
in what's nothin some action and also we
decide what the rules of engagement are

827
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,440
in cyberspace

828
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,720
even without all those treaties me to
decide what's allowed and what isn't

829
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,790
know what's share in the ward what is
its we are actually know

830
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:02,500
we don't have these definitions well
we'll see you decide at what level in

831
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,970
the command structure

832
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:07,260
should these issues be made

833
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,279
you right now the United States was
humor her she's written about this

834
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:11,190
extensively

835
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:15,810
that cyberwar decisions like preparing
the battlefield leaving logic bombs

836
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,200
are being made it far too low a level in
the command structure

837
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,830
then stacked these things are
internationally dangerous enough

838
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:30,089
the she may be made by the US presidents
not by some bird colonel

839
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:34,890
and that is destabilizing have the
decisions being made at a low level

840
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,930
certainly any conversations about this

841
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:43,029
internationally so we know I would love
this is being made

842
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:49,370
we'd understand cyber mercenaries a
Mercedes be really popular with armies

843
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,960
me the kind without invoking the
beginning the last century

844
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,120
but in cyberspace they're coming back

845
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:01,430
and whether it's true recruitment of
mercenaries are false leg recruitment

846
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,520
a lot of these cyber weapon capabilities
are being a

847
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,510
are being contract adapt

848
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,940
and we've really need to figure out how
to deal with non-state actors

849
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,930
and and the gamut from kids playing
politics

850
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,960
terrorists made this is only going to
get worse

851
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,770
as more these capabilities guest for the
diffuse the population as things get

852
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,799
easier

853
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,529
write me to think about dispensaries and
and you know i think is a discussion

854
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:36,980
about resilience

855
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,850
that we resilience in cyberspace

856
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,339
and most pleasing when he stopped
feeding our fears but there are risks

857
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:48,890
here but they're not new though not
unprecedented the things we dealt with

858
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,359
before the things we can deal with

859
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,240
and we knew we love adult conversation
about it

860
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:03,240
so that's my talk about happy to take
questions

861
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:10,790
you can't leave yet much less questions
the foods not ready

862
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:17,790
some estar yes

863
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:23,130
would

864
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,480
you know I think they will be secretary
something right now i think is largely

865
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,390
media myth

866
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:30,860
may because the

867
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,530
yet may terrorists want the to kill
people and you know he's annoyed people

868
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,840
you can imagine I always think the story
I think I've is is bin Laden in this

869
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,450
cave is associate says

870
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,890
I know the next attack against the great
American saying we're gonna cheap down

871
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:46,140
there

872
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,790
email the blood to the slack the guy
cool

873
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:53,740
you know what I have my email it's a
holiday right on the net I'm not

874
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,890
terrorized

875
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:58,560
I'm annoyed inconvenienced maybe I'm
happy he's

876
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,240
yeah I mean that we know this because
occasionally these things have max

877
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,130
that's right now but years ago USB case
in satellites

878
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,890
was down for a while because a bad so
for upgrade nobody was terrorized

879
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:14,590
so so well certainly there's a potential
cyber chairs neatly will be more in the

880
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:15,170
future

881
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,520
thing right now it's the media myth but
yes I mean in terms of the

882
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,910
the broader cyber complex you know

883
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:28,910
it's something you have to think about
now these difference but Ken

884
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,220
church I mean yeah I mean

885
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,700
me it makes a great movie in a mean

886
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,690
feature think that but should think
about 9/11 in addition example this

887
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,300
because

888
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,270
up when the twin towers collapse they
clashed on 1w the New York City's

889
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:52,950
biggest own switches so you can imagine
a cyberattack that which take down the

890
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:53,790
phone network

891
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,400
as a precursor something else and we
have earned and thinks about 9/11 no one

892
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,900
says

893
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,050
oh my god and then with the phone
network dropped

894
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,430
it doesn't even make the radar of
atrocities

895
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:08,350
so I just don't see it as terror

896
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,710
mean your weekend then all these
complicated story honestly

897
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,660
drive a truck bomb into a building
because that's what works

898
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,780
you know you see so you drop the

899
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,250
you know the emergency phone network too
be it's in the noise

900
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:26,560
but that will change your this matter
time

901
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,240
before someone to do real damage in
cyberspace so

902
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,530
car had a conversation now is valuable
discretion over there

903
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:41,740
site well you know we we see that show

904
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,420
right we see it as an in Japan which are
attack in star reactors

905
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,500
but 2003 United States there was a large
black out in the northeast quadrant in

906
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,940
the Southeast Washington Canada

907
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,500
she these things happen attacks in
Charlotte Church happen all the time

908
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
not common but their regular and again

909
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,540
you know did not really tear

910
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,900
mean you know Japan was having been
right now house

911
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,520
you know is crossing into tear but it is
such a large-scale attack that you could

912
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,670
possibly do that

913
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:16,040
we as humans humans could have done that
you know is just such a powerful

914
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,520
force that cause all that damage

915
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,930
but you know we think about attack even
attach a girl image capture

916
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:28,240
they happen regularly by accidents so we
know how to deal with them

917
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,900
we know there are stacks and people just
aren't terrorized

918
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,390
mean the black at the US was really
annoying

919
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:40,600
that's as far as it got and yes they
would cost money and yes some people

920
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,770
died

921
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:46,880
this is what happens you know I live in
Minneapolis we had a a bridge collapse

922
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,270
several years ago I E R people died you
can imagine the terrace blowing up that

923
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:53,170
bridge

924
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:57,290
E you know the tear is much more our
reaction in the thing itself

925
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,640
which i think is interesting

926
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:07,610
as he had way back and I'm not be able
to hear you this is the problem

927
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:14,610
oh well

928
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:32,310
me you know really this is this is a
talk about everything but crime

929
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,680
you think that is really a talk about
not financially motivated

930
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,480
attacks you and financial in and again
it's the same tactics the same defenses

931
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,280
a lot of what I'm saying applies and and
most and what

932
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,590
governments have been dealing with in
cyberspace are financially but it

933
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,820
actually ranging from known criminals

934
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,510
Georgia the a very organized crime and

935
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:00,360
there are the same issues the same
problems the same international issues

936
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,710
and I think definitely much everything
they said

937
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:07,619
applies although you you tend to get

938
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,680
attackers that are are easier to deflect

939
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,910
because you know I wanna rub a bank I
don't care which bank

940
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:19,920
hi We're politically motivated akers
tend to be more focused

941
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,000
and I think that's an important
difference

942
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,310
that would largely ignored as we build

943
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:29,770
securian charges against crime but yeah
I think there is the whole spectrum

944
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,030
me when you look at at financially
motivated

945
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:37,910
attackers you put me motivated attackers
are closer to

946
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:43,369
the hackers a volt who would do we were
doing it for you know bragging rights or

947
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:44,410
to see if they could

948
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,760
me its is more its much closer to that

949
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,690
with the normal financial incentives
tend not to work

950
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:56,180
because the attackers Arends influenced
by them in the same way you'd expect

951
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:01,890
see hand over there then over there

952
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:08,890
you first

953
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,819
it's definitely true is less I had
experiments that there that out is no no

954
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:31,329
we a logical reason

955
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:36,309
but we fear she %uh attacks from humans
much more the natural tax I'm censure

956
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:40,789
and animals actually in the middle like
bear attacks are half a scary

957
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:44,099
as people and and and their more scary
than you know

958
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:47,779
natural disasters although yup tsunami

959
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:51,190
in Japan me so you really think Cameron
you know

960
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:55,730
knows what's going on there right miss
the hand over here

961
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:02,730
in

962
01:03:15,369 --> 01:03:22,369
yen

963
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:30,220
min as actually more general that that

964
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:35,580
threats you can't see are scarier threat
you can see and it's not just cyberspace

965
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,630
like no threats in the air radiation

966
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:42,960
she can't see it is scarier me the been
great secada studies and what people

967
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,620
fear

968
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,270
and not being able to see the threats
makes it scarier

969
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,980
GS cyberspace threats are scary this was
good there unknown

970
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,160
right science fiction all day there you

971
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,380
you can't understand them whereas you
know up ally in you can see that's a lie

972
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,750
and I'm scared that we know what it is

973
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,740
saves trace threats are more nebulous I
think that that the jury that's

974
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,590
definitely true

975
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,060
babe remains a good example right you

976
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,500
because we we we we we we we don't know
we tend to still in

977
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:18,610
especially with the some in the media
hype it's easy to %uh to exaggerate

978
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:22,580
you know you know the hackers can take
on the Internet

979
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:28,040
great exaggeration see hand way

980
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:35,040
back there you must also be a
loudspeaker

981
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,920
i think im sure thats really think that
and if you build in a kill switch

982
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,470
a suitability I'll I E a delivery
capability

983
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:06,270
shut on the internets you invite the bad
guys to use a capability

984
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,620
me is probably with you know if we build
that a

985
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:14,250
this incident is some shin by lawmakers
propose this at only the good guys can

986
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,110
push the button

987
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:21,100
I don't know why they assume that make
because you got a button mare

988
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,380
all it takes is spoofing a good guy get
pushed the button

989
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:29,310
best to china makes the day go job
easier so yes I'm deadly not a fan

990
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:32,350
having a kill switch I think it should
be a negative internet kill switch

991
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:39,350
as a hand there first

992
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,490
shit it's gotten lester fine with the
couple with a couple hrs and how

993
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,780
electricity works

994
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:03,370
or how car works range the know how it
would

995
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,520
they know how it works near the
interface works

996
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,190
is no that behind-the-scenes a lot going
on they don't quite get

997
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:16,230
so we I might know how a car works even
though an open the engine looks

998
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,220
completely

999
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,450
foreign to me I know that i cud how the
light switch work

1000
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:25,080
my house the night nothing up power
generation so the

1001
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,080
so what it technology does it hides
complexity

1002
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,520
and people get used to occurred with
their metaphors

1003
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,420
it was when those metaphors get ripped
open that

1004
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:39,430
people when yo realize how they know
they actually are and may get more

1005
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,130
scared

1006
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:44,460
so you know that it is avail that's a
convenient Vale

1007
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,050
now let people be comfortable internet
so the way it works

1008
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,480
show a hand was this restaurant menu
sure your

1009
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:58,480
yeah I do I just read an article like
the last week that said in the US credit

1010
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,220
card fraud as as lowest point in years

1011
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:13,710
which surprised me because I had always
believed it was increasing

1012
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:17,420
so I have to say right now

1013
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:21,510
I don't know I don't think there's a
lotta height

1014
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,630
the thing is anti hype because visa
desperately wants you

1015
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,710
to believe it sinks the merchants want
you to believe it safe

1016
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:32,880
nobody except maybe you know the
security companies

1017
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,320
one high pitch so there's a lot of
pressure to keep the hype down

1018
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,510
but

1019
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:44,640
I have to say that actually don't know
whether it's increasing degrees in my

1020
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,190
guess is increasing because it's
actually quite profitable

1021
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:52,000
but maybe I'm wrong ice ahead you're
down here

1022
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,000
yes he he he doesn't have to shout good

1023
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:08,140
%um questions you can think that you can
just put in a kill switch in ipv6 me

1024
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:12,940
I'm not saying that you can't as a
switch as a

1025
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,420
telco as a company shut off parts the
net and I refuse to get traffic from

1026
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:17,910
this

1027
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:21,330
set IP addresses or for these protocols
are for the

1028
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,510
for this day you can do that but the
question is

1029
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:27,570
should countries be allowed to do it

1030
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:32,680
should third parties be able to do it so
it's not the phone company saying

1031
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,500
this traffic jams on a shutdown it's
someone else to on the phone company

1032
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,680
hate you have to do that natural I think

1033
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,870
the dangerous but yes as a

1034
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,950
receiver Internet traffic you can block
pieces up its

1035
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:51,130
right you could block it all but that's
fine would

1036
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:54,980
that his

1037
01:08:54,980 --> 01:09:00,370
with them well you know that some are
demanding and some orange

1038
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:04,530
well we'll see how it goes right you
right now in the US

1039
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:09,120
and I just heard this that the bill
manning a kill switch has been rewritten

1040
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,710
to prohibiting a kill switch

1041
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:15,240
get these put a big not operator under
the law and we're done I'm at and I

1042
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,220
don't know how to how this works

1043
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:22,400
so meet lots of things can happen as you
go through legislative processes is

1044
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,160
always more

1045
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:30,160
Jahan back in there yes well we know
about how defending us how certain tax

1046
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,490
I mean there are companies that that
sell not surge protection each

1047
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:41,640
meet me know how this works he you you
need a bigger pie pan the attacker and

1048
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,510
you can survive

1049
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:46,310
ministers had this is how we defend so
nothing new here

1050
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,950
now we just we just have to defend
ourselves

1051
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:55,120
and in the worst case you you know you
lose me get shut down for a little while

1052
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,840
that's happened to mean you know hand
countries companies survive

1053
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,320
right Amazon's been a victim CNN's been
a victim there okay

1054
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,500
you lose some revenue but maybe maybe
not

1055
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,730
no we we seem to have learned from a lot
is now serves attacks that

1056
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:15,240
that the revenue tends not to be lost
but displaced

1057
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,010
that if you can if someone can get to
the

1058
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:23,440
Amazon Web site they're more likely to
buy their book tomorrow then to go to a

1059
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,480
competitor's website

1060
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,390
mean some some businesses lost but less
than you think

1061
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:33,540
Sahand close enough runs

1062
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:40,540
there is

1063
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,230
questions every address in any phishing
that we probably have jewish lately we

1064
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,520
undervalue which

1065
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,800
that enemy in its incredibly valuable

1066
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,220
and something that's good for society
and civilization thing which we should

1067
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:58,300
cherish and keep and a lot of people
think it has no value

1068
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,580
I mean yes course it has problems said
the butt

1069
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:05,360
but anonymity is is important to a free

1070
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,390
so I'm a big fan Danny we love it the
text doesn't matter because you cannot

1071
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,530
build

1072
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:15,660
yes just without enemy I mean you know
you can you

1073
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:21,790
any NEC's any not anonymous system
somebody can building in an anonymous

1074
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:25,170
overlay just by being an aggregator

1075
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:28,230
made so so you can't

1076
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:32,510
make enemigo way of me and that you just
can't so so incensed a non-issue

1077
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:37,730
mean you can try but you will be able to
the hand over there

1078
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:44,730
where less that whether

1079
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:48,670
any country so I was willing we now know
%eh HB Gary did

1080
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:52,050
right we know that they built and sold
cyber weapons

1081
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:56,510
up since I I'd like had never heard the
company before this all happens

1082
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:59,630
my guess is there's more than one out
there

1083
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:03,180
that are right now building and selling
cyber weapons

1084
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,180
what sounds like a fun job range

1085
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:10,290
in sewn but no e

1086
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:15,960
it up companies are not public about
doing this me HB Gary didn't like the

1087
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,720
fact that we now know that they built
and sold cyber weapons

1088
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:25,470
its wasn't on their web sites did they
didn't have a shopping cart function

1089
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:29,340
me now they might so so no we we don't
have proof

1090
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:33,510
but almost certainly if this one is more
than one

1091
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:39,610
did

1092
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:46,610
good

1093
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:52,800
mmm yet it trend that may change rate
yet companies might say yes we're inside

1094
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,630
weapons business

1095
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:57,200
member right now it's so new and so
should we know they talking about

1096
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:02,090
but sure that could change we can
imagine the program in air space where

1097
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,920
we know we have ratified get loans with
these days is a real company

1098
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,310
can say yes we we know we make cyber
weapons we we celebs just enough aidid

1099
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:09,760
that

1100
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,370
a than 80 countries and and you know get
high satisfaction marks and bias I read

1101
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,300
as much trade in

1102
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,460
its after sure you can see this
happening

1103
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:25,460
to hand over their arm and abdomen last
question

1104
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:43,900
then

1105
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:47,370
but actually not I mean and countries I
mean we've been doing

1106
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,820
and the NSA's doing in espionage since
the there was internet

1107
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:55,110
nah not gonna stop no reason why they
should Mimi internet isn't different

1108
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,930
just another place on them

1109
01:13:56,930 --> 01:14:00,200
I'm not saying you should be no estas
nanette not be dead

1110
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:06,340
that be ridiculous course there will be
right so I think we're almost done

1111
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:11,670
Jeff promised she'd be back can run out
for a conference call he's not so i i'm

1112
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:15,489
gonna pretend I know what's going on but
a first I when I want to help its

1113
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:17,320
resident daily announcements

1114
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,800
I'm writing a new book this is it this
is the only copy can have it

1115
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,670
up at I mention on my blog

1116
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:28,340
about a month ago and its it's called
the dishonest mine Rd

1117
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:33,260
and it's about these are the fundamental
role of security in human civilization

1118
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,510
you know why aids why security exists
and what it does

1119
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:41,110
and if life is good it will be out in
the fall its life is less good I'll be

1120
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,600
out in the spring of life sucks will be
out next fall

1121
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,180
and so it should be noticed my blog
posts in my newsletters becoming smaller

1122
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,830
next few months that's why

1123
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:54,890
so I'm and if people are interested in
this I'd love to talk a little bit about

1124
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:55,280
it

1125
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:00,070
was looking for critical readers a first
draft a

1126
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:04,410
uncritical readers are not useful to me
those are easy to get

1127
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,239
but anyways so people might be willing
to read it and really makes up some

1128
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:07,980
comments

1129
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:13,230
mean you please please talk to me and
and so I believe what's gonna happen now

1130
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:17,370
is those two people to come in and their
contents

1131
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:20,550

there your is

1132
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,719
which means beer

1133
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:26,920
the year food right out there

1134
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,390
