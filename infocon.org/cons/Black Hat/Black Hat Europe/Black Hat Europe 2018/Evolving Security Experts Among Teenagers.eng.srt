1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,670
so hello everyone welcome thank you for

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,019
attending our talk today we will present

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,840
some of the biggest challenges as we see

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,480
it in a cybersecurity world in the

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,820
upcoming years and also currently and

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,750
our solution for that which is teaching

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,789
cybersecurity among teenagers and

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,310
creating the next generation of security

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,250
experts so let's start off with a

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,659
regular presentation disclaimer and of

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,820
the views opinions or things we will

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,489
present you today or in any way related

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,860
to our employer any organization or

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,489
something this is only our views yeah so

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,700
who are we

16
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,149
my name is not once I add I'm from

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,489
Israel

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm a security associate with Julian I

19
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,510
used to be a security researcher at Aqua

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,800
security which also presented here today

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,300
and yesterday in the Arsenal a or I also

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,750
been a security associate with PayPal

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,289
I'm the founder a and also part of a

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,479
security group called Knox al based in

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,770
Israel composed only of teenagers who

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,929
speak about it later

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,000
and I am 18 years old hello everyone my

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,409
name is Noemi by the way in case that

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,990
the presentation we stopped working we

30
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,540
will continue it's just a challenge so

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,429
my name is Romy I'm currently the city

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,140
or a co-founder of a new startup in

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,490
Israel called Brazilian prior to that I

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,170
was the CTO and co-founder of a company

35
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,000
called so active that was acquired by

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,670
PayPal on 2015 also I'm a PhD candidate

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,030
and the TU Tel Aviv University focused

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,829
on cyber security and education and

39
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,520
above all in that I'm a proud father and

40
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,589
husband here is the outline of our talk

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,450
I'm not going to go over each of one of

42
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,610
them I will give you up on understanding

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,560
and of course we'll go going to go deep

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,360
into all of them so we'll start with the

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,000
growing need for cyber security experts

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,159
among the industry after that we will

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,469
detail the current educational system

48
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,509
after that we were going to detail the

49
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,098
problem that we have today with the

50
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,500
current solutions and we will suggest

51
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,079
our own opinions and our own solution

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,980
for that problem and to show us that and

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,870
demonstrate

54
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,540
we will show a couple of implementation

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,319
up regarding our solution that is been

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,099
conducted in Israel great so let's start

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,589
with an introduction today this is a

58
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,980
graph showing the US need of computing

59
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,340
jobs by 2020 there will be missing 1

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,929
million computing jobs in the US this

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:45,110
number globally is 85 million by 2030

62
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:47,310
and this is eight point five trillion

63
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,790
opportunity a trillion dollars

64
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,510
opportunity worth of unrealized annual

65
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,630
revenue if we look at the fast growing

66
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,090
need of cyber security jobs we can see

67
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,579
that the rate that cyber security

68
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,030
positions are growing is three times as

69
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:09,470
much

70
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:12,980
it's the IT 18 need for workers and

71
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:16,349
study conducted about frozen Salomon

72
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,819
forecasted that in 2015 there will be a

73
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:24,929
1.5 worker shortage this forecast

74
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:28,200
already been revised for 1.8 million by

75
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,280
2022 and other studies say that it will

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:36,510
be also 2 million by 2022 if we look at

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:41,250
the what the security workers think we

78
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:43,410
see that 60% globally think of security

79
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,810
workers think that darn aren't enough

80
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,170
cybersecurity workers in their

81
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,359
departments if you see the main reasons

82
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,730
for that most of them half of them say

83
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,889
that the main reason for that is that

84
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,888
qualified personnel is difficult to find

85
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,880
and there is not enough a qualified

86
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,109
personnel in their in their departments

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,700
now because we will speak up a little

88
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,000
bit about Israel in this talk will

89
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,190
demonstrate using examples from Israel

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,769
let me introduce a little bit about

91
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,310
Israel so Israel is the world's second

92
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,930
exporter of cybersecurity and tools its

93
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,660
leads the employer demand for

94
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,010
cybersecurity a so we have a big issue

95
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,099
in Israel we need to tackle this issue

96
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,039
find a security expert and evolve them

97
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,099
from nothing

98
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:33,409
mm if we look at the employer demand in

99
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:37,069
Israel we see that per million positions

100
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:41,090
occupied and unoccupied there is 5,000

101
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:43,970
occupied and unoccupied job demand for

102
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,560
cybersecurity talent so this is a big

103
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,289
figure it's a much bigger than any

104
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,599
country in the world more than the US

105
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:54,409
which is a the first largest exploit an

106
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:56,449
exporter of a cybersecurity if you look

107
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,330
at their main characteristics of cyber

108
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,960
security experts some of you also have

109
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:05,599
these characteristics it is composed of

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,849
three first if thinking outside of the

111
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:10,130
box thinking outside of the box means

112
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:13,789
innovation means thinking differently

113
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,759
then others then other people in your

114
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,289
company and outside of your company the

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,530
second one is adversarial thinking

116
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:24,020
which means no will predict how the

117
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,568
enemy will work how the enemy will

118
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,789
attack your systems basically what it

119
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,729
means is that you know or security

120
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:33,620
experts should know how a code can break

121
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:35,900
especially according their systems and

122
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,690
tools predict how they can tackle these

123
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,120
issues or potential issues the third one

124
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,050
is technical knowledge each good

125
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,969
security expert or an expert should have

126
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,820
broad technical knowledge in many fields

127
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:54,199
such as networking forensics and etc etc

128
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:56,750
and another very important role as you

129
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,710
can see here on the shorts we made for

130
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:05,509
this event that will give away later mmm

131
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:07,520
there is the 10,000 hours rule Gladwell

132
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,569
in his book outliers the story of

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,560
success said that the key to achieving

134
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:18,440
world-class expertise in any skill is

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,039
practicing and experiencing for a total

136
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,819
of around 10,000 hours this sentence has

137
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,800
two meanings for us first is that we

138
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:30,080
believe that each of each one of you and

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,509
that's one of the messages we want to

140
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,130
deliver in this talk each one of you and

141
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,510
each person in the world should practice

142
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,610
and experience as much as you can in

143
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,930
order to become an expert and every day

144
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,289
I learn something you will speak about

145
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,539
it also later

146
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:46,770
and the second one is that every

147
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,360
cybersecurity expert should experience

148
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,039
and learn a lot and have a lot of

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,199
experience in the industry before he

150
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,199
actually becomes an expert in something

151
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,818
okay so after we've talked a little bit

152
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,899
about the growing demand let's talk a

153
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,099
little bit about the current

154
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:08,309
cybersecurity education landscape here

155
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:11,699
you can see a templated educational

156
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:14,699
landscape I'm not going to detail it now

157
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,399
but please remember that we will go into

158
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,909
we are going to visit it again when we

159
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,819
will talk about the solution when

160
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:27,839
examining the computer science education

161
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:31,430
for teenagers it's mostly starting at

162
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,860
the high school and if you will look and

163
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,199
try to categorize what are the topics in

164
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,569
which those teenagers are learning you

165
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,349
can see programming algorithmic thinking

166
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:47,089
data structures state machines and more

167
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:53,370
but cybersecurity deep knowledge is

168
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:56,269
missing if you will try to cluster the

169
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,680
landscape of the cybersecurity education

170
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:01,169
we can find that there are three main

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,689
clusters that can be created the first

172
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,818
one academia the second one industry in

173
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:09,439
the third one cybersecurity in which we

174
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,439
are teaching our kids and teenagers

175
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,330
before we will show in examples I want

176
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,979
to give a little disclaimer we're not we

177
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,930
are going to talk about a couple of

178
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:24,058
examples but we are not saying that or

179
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:26,999
recommending each one of them at first

180
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:29,669
let's start with academia there is a

181
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:32,750
growing understanding in academia for

182
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:35,519
the need of cybersecurity capabilities

183
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,328
because of that we can see that there

184
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,209
are new cybersecurity master programs

185
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:45,930
that are being created for example you

186
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:48,869
can see different programs from from

187
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,120
Europe here you can see an example from

188
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,800
Israel and MSC program from the bank

189
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
Iranian visiting from the south you can

190
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,790
see another example

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,410
the screen is not flickering from Oxford

192
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,920
you can see another example from the

193
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,279
University of York and one of the

194
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,560
problem is that teenagers are not

195
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,360
relevant for those specific moments

196
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,709
because most of them don't have their

197
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,660
masters yet of course that understanding

198
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:17,939
academia is not relevant only for Europe

199
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,589
it's only relevant for other places you

200
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:24,770
can see a paper that was published on

201
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:29,790
2007 17 which shows 61 programs of

202
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,829
cybersecurity across the globe across 17

203
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:36,270
different countries and of course there

204
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:39,270
are many more if you are talking about

205
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,510
industry most of the education industry

206
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,250
is focused around certifications we have

207
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,930
certifications which are focused on

208
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,420
hands-on experience we have

209
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,859
certifications which are focused on

210
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:55,110
policy which are focused about knowledge

211
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,690
you can see another example of those

212
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,450
pair certification and of course it's

213
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,130
only a partial list of that again when

214
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,839
thinking about teenagers we can

215
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,329
understand that there are mainly two

216
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,430
limitations between them and those

217
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:11,489
certification first of all is the cost

218
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,010
second there are certifications in which

219
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:18,209
you need experience in the industry to

220
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,220
apply for them and another shift that is

221
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:23,939
being conducted as part of the education

222
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,370
landscape is the hybrid between academia

223
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,020
and industry here you see you can see an

224
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,240
example in which you can turn your

225
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:35,390
certification into a degree you can use

226
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,390
those certification and transfer credit

227
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:42,959
but when we are talking about teenagers

228
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:45,950
what we are teaching them mostly safe

229
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,099
Internet privacy controls awareness

230
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:52,440
password safety social media safety but

231
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,120
what about network threats

232
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,079
what about denial of service for example

233
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,400
what about IP spoofing what about code

234
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,400
vulnerabilities buffer overflows SQL

235
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,930
injection coated scripting and others if

236
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,250
you think about it a lot of teenagers

237
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,910
are developing today

238
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,680
applications for mobile web apps but

239
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,870
they don't have the basic understanding

240
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:26,520
of those specific threats and why

241
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:29,690
because we are not teaching them that so

242
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,300
now we will try to define the problem

243
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:36,000
the three main problems we see from this

244
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,780
perspective so let's start with the

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,330
unskilled workforce how can it be that

246
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,709
none of the top ten US computer science

247
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:49,710
programs even require a cybersecurity

248
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:54,240
course for graduation more than that

249
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,280
three of those top 10 u.s. computer

250
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,590
science programs which may be also some

251
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,770
of the best programs in the world

252
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,650
globally

253
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't even offer an elective course in

254
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:12,060
cybersecurity what does that mean if not

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,310
the ten USA universities don't think

256
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,790
that students should even learn

257
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:21,930
cybersecurity

258
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:25,709
the results of that we can see in what

259
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,709
cyber what security leaders around the

260
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,630
industry say they say is a 77 percent 77

261
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,670
percent of them think that the

262
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,410
educational system does not prepare

263
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,510
cyber secure enough does not fully

264
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,170
prepare cyber security professionals for

265
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,280
the industry

266
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,469
this results in that the fewer than one

267
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,699
in four candidates are found qualified

268
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:50,160
for cybersecurity position now if we

269
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,490
look at the limitation of the

270
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,140
educational system we can see that the

271
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,810
main things are that the lack of

272
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,230
experience in complex projects and real

273
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,630
world technologies are the main reason

274
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,550
why they are not found qualified later

275
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,490
on when they try to fight a find a

276
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,099
career how many of these students even

277
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,680
learn source control or cloud cloud

278
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,900
technologies or containers or

279
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,699
understanding the risks in every one of

280
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,250
these we are war technologies students

281
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,310
when they are not

282
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,720
getting the right education off

283
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,449
cybersecurity they're not understanding

284
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,560
later on when they apply for a real

285
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,060
world in the industry they're not

286
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,520
understanding the security risks behind

287
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,069
it and if we look at the characteristics

288
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,140
of the security expert we see that they

289
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,580
lack all of them technical knowledge

290
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,949
they don't have because they didn't get

291
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,180
the right course or right education

292
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,580
they're not thinking about the ball out

293
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,800
of the box because they don't know about

294
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,040
what to think they never they never even

295
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,660
been familiar with cybersecurity and

296
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,060
adversarial thinking is something that

297
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,589
they are they can't even think about

298
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:03,430
because they weren't ever exposed to the

299
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,860
topic another limitation of the

300
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,739
educational system is that the teenagers

301
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,900
and show me showed earlier teenagers

302
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,430
cybersecurity education is mostly

303
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,170
focused around Internet safety tinertia

304
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,199
it's not it's not uncommon to find in

305
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,790
Israel teenagers who are being taught in

306
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,930
school about it and safety about privacy

307
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,730
controls but we still don't control

308
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,560
their privacy not in facebook not in

309
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,720
Instagram they don't care about it and

310
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,780
they are not really understanding it the

311
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,990
real reason behind that even thought

312
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,180
they are taught about it is that they

313
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,830
are not really understanding the reason

314
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,439
why they need to afraid from these

315
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,300
threats why they need to be afraid from

316
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,130
these risks why they need to protect

317
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:53,319
themselves from the from these risks so

318
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:56,470
we need to language show Later the

319
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,500
solutions but kids and teenagers are not

320
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,830
exposed to real technical matters in the

321
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,820
cybersecurity education and another big

322
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:10,570
problem is women in tech so how can it

323
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,150
be again that 74 percent of girls in

324
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,010
middle school express interest in

325
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,730
science and technology in engineering

326
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:21,370
and in math but only a couple of years

327
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:26,589
later in high school ready to choose the

328
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:30,610
college major only 0.4% of them choose

329
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,860
computer science that's very evolved

330
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,740
numbers

331
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,960
okay another another thing is that even

332
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,100
with a increase it growth increase

333
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:46,180
growth of 15 to 20 percent in the past

334
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,640
today and in the upcoming years of

335
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,800
cybersecurity positions and jobs and

336
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,260
computer science in general still the

337
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,240
vast majority of computer science will

338
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:01,090
be pursued and feel fulfilled by men

339
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,980
okay you may say now this is the

340
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:07,000
situation but we're working on it and

341
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:10,600
soon many many women will be a learning

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,340
and getting the college degree or a

343
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,900
university degree on computer science

344
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:19,660
but as you can see or fully understand

345
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,720
this representation 37 percent of them

346
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:27,400
of the computer science graduates 30

347
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,400
years ago were women today in 2015 this

348
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:36,550
number has been decreased twice to 18

349
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,750
percent now if we look at the situation

350
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,180
in cybersecurity we can see that the

351
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,220
situation is a little bit better 20% of

352
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:46,449
the global cyber security workforce is

353
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:50,470
occupied by women but it still means

354
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:55,720
that only one out of five workers in

355
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:58,510
cyber security industry are women which

356
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,270
is again very bad if we try to

357
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,900
understand the reason behind that or if

358
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,069
we can see some something little bit a

359
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,670
negative from this perspective we see

360
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,319
that only 13% of the fortune 500 leaders

361
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,580
of cyber security if it's not twenty

362
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,919
percent of them working in the industry

363
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,919
are women yes but 13 percent of the

364
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,810
fortune 500 leaders are female now if we

365
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,850
try to understand the reasons why girls

366
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,040
are not choosing computer science okay

367
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,540
maybe under my can see that that when

368
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,859
they look at a industry when they look

369
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,600
at the leaders the people that leave the

370
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:32,740
community and the leader industry they

371
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,159
see no inspiration there they see is

372
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,690
that they cannot be there as them

373
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,690
because women are not a majority

374
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,669
so after talking about the problem in

375
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,799
the of course the growing need for cyber

376
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,070
security expert let's try to think about

377
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,809
the solution

378
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,990
recall that we saw this presentation

379
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:57,260
before what we are saying in our

380
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,840
proposed solution says the following in

381
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,669
order to improve the situation and

382
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,970
create the next generation of cyber

383
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:08,400
security experts we need to wrap each

384
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,799
one of the phrases in the joke in the

385
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,650
educational system with relevant

386
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,650
programs which are focused on cyber

387
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:21,960
security among teenagers here you can

388
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:25,289
see an implementation of such suggestion

389
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,390
and how its conducted in this way first

390
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:31,230
of all I would say each of one of those

391
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:33,059
programs is a great program it it will

392
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,309
take us more than one presentation to go

393
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,559
over each one of them because of that I

394
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:40,379
urge you first with the white paper in

395
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,750
which we did almo second also you can

396
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,789
serve to the website of each of one of

397
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,090
them with the leaks you have seen you I

398
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:50,780
will give only a slight example on it

399
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,039
one of them let's start with pixels a

400
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,129
program which is targeting the sixth

401
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,950
grade students and the goal is to give

402
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,559
introduction to technology why second

403
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,830
law what is technology connect the young

404
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,428
students with the new technologies which

405
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,820
are wising the second one star tech

406
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:15,210
which is focused on 17 and from 7th to

407
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,149
9th grade students and the core of that

408
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,970
program is to give an interaction

409
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,850
introduction to programming for example

410
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:27,960
the students there are developing

411
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:30,719
computer games the next step is a

412
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,880
program in Israel called maximum which

413
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,940
is the national cyber education program

414
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,190
Israel in that program students are

415
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,890
learning twice a week after school hours

416
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,860
by the way every session is about three

417
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,440
hours and the main goal is to create the

418
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,120
next generation of security personnel in

419
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,920
Israel in that specific program the

420
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,570
students are learning networking Oh

421
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,100
antek systems security threat and others

422
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,350
one of the biggest things that is being

423
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,659
conducted in that specific programs is

424
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,899
that the students are creating

425
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:12,400
real-world projects with tremendous from

426
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:15,040
the industry those 3 prod a programs are

427
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,730
operated by the cyber education center

428
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,260
in Israel and of course with a ladder

429
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,570
with a lot of partners again I encourage

430
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,400
you to go over and read more information

431
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,649
about those program the last program

432
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,960
that I want to talk about is the IOT

433
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,450
share program also known as the future

434
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,850
scientist program the program was

435
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,360
created based on the vision of the late

436
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,580
Prime Minister when President of Israel

437
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,639
mr. Shimon Peres the goal of the program

438
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:46,149
is to nature the next generation of

439
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,460
scientists in Israel one of the majors

440
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,820
in that specific program is

441
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,110
cybersecurity the goal is to connect

442
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,909
between formal education from academia

443
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,580
those specific kids are starting to

444
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:03,610
learn in university and as you can see

445
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:07,780
the program started the eighth grade

446
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:10,510
they are learning calculus district mock

447
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,480
discrete mathematics linear algebra and

448
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,160
in parallel they are also learning and

449
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,710
having hands-on experience in

450
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,930
cybersecurity because the combination

451
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,120
between them and all of those that learn

452
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,910
linear algebra the linear combination

453
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:29,290
between all of them is very important

454
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,600
and thus we get from one hand the

455
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,840
academia and from the second hand the

456
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,439
practical experience and of course with

457
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,419
the connection of the a of the industry

458
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,740
that specific program is operated by the

459
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:47,320
many this fund center for future

460
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:52,510
scientists again all of those programs

461
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:54,669
are being conducted between in our part

462
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,390
of a general initiative in Israel that

463
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:00,370
connects industry academia volunteers

464
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:04,150
and more to create the next generation

465
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:07,899
of cybersecurity experts and that's not

466
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,940
enough one of the problems that that one

467
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,340
stated before was the lack of women in

468
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,320
the industry because of that there are

469
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,059
too many initiatives in Israel which are

470
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,210
focused on that the first one is cyber

471
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,879
girls which is a community that focus on

472
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,330
technology computer and cyber and

473
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,570
connects between young girls and women

474
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:32,649
from the industry they have architects

475
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:36,399
together they have someone to talk with

476
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,870
about their inspirations also a project

477
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,540
that was started a couple of months ago

478
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,550
in Evo it's called correct my minute and

479
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,620
is in English while if I will try to

480
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:48,159
stand is that the project of you are

481
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:52,449
amazing and the goal is to create a

482
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,640
curriculum which is focused on girls to

483
00:22:52,450 --> 00:23:00,160
encourage them to select science and

484
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:02,800
technology as the course of study one of

485
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:13,330
the things that are also being conducted

486
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:15,850
is to find inspirations and to create so

487
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,678
and to create some kind of an

488
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,719
inspiration for excellence among youth

489
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,370
with Israel so that there are different

490
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,950
competitions in computer science

491
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,110
cybersecurity that are conducted here

492
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,760
you can see only a couple of example of

493
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,309
them again I encourage you to read the

494
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,500
wiper for more information and I will go

495
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:36,790
in to give a little example of part of

496
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:41,790
them the first one called kagu is a math

497
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:46,149
and computer competition the competition

498
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:49,090
was founded on - on 2000 until now there

499
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:51,460
was about 19 competitions and it's

500
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,040
mostly based on those questions here you

501
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:58,179
can see an image from one of the

502
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,490
contests code blue extreme which is

503
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:03,880
based on calls in which we have

504
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,040
survivors written in assembling one of

505
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,450
the goals of the competition is of the

506
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,830
competitions is not only to encourage

507
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:14,170
excellence is also to open the minds of

508
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,360
teenagers to information and curriculum

509
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,310
that didn't it fought before for example

510
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,820
most of teenagers are not learning

511
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,820
assembly

512
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,340
don't have been others are much more

513
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:30,460
easy and because of that there are

514
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:33,459
specific things that we are doing and

515
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,350
when I'm saying doing is not we it's the

516
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,900
community in Israel the industry in

517
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:45,699
Israel the government in Israel to

518
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:47,440
encourage those things since 2015 there

519
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,330
is a competition Israel called skills

520
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,049
coding you can think about it like the

521
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:55,299
Olympics of cybersecurity in Israel it

522
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:59,379
is based on country on gamification we

523
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:01,929
have code versus code the specific

524
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,830
competition is being managed and

525
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:08,799
operated by the Ministry of Education

526
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:10,840
each one of the teams has a mentor so

527
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,250
here we can see another collaboration

528
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,530
between the government the Minister of

529
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,650
Education and industry which delivers

530
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:20,710
those specific mentors to help the young

531
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:24,360
teams from high schools by the way to

532
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:30,400
understand how to develop code how to

533
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:35,500
express the skills among among a group

534
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:37,450
to develop soft skills here we can see a

535
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,190
couple of examples of the cubit of the

536
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:40,780
gamification one thing which is very

537
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,990
interesting in that program is that the

538
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,260
winners of a specific year are becoming

539
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:51,640
the development team of the competition

540
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,460
for the next year you can see that we

541
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:59,740
also want as a community in Israel to

542
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:04,120
develop and to help create role models

543
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:07,030
for other kids and all of those could be

544
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,239
also kids not only people from the

545
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,789
industry if you can see also the

546
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,870
supported language that all part of that

547
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:19,658
specific competition so if we will try

548
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:22,090
to sum up what are the basic building

549
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:25,990
blocks of our new educational approach

550
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:30,459
first of all teach technology don't stay

551
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,890
only in internet safety don't think that

552
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,260
those specific kids can get deeper

553
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,430
understandable of technologies

554
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,950
mentor them while they are doing

555
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,160
real-world projects and we will show

556
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:47,180
examples of those specific projects

557
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,800
encourage excellence it could be in the

558
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,340
course of mentoring it could be in the

559
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:55,610
course of competitions give them an

560
00:26:52,340 --> 00:27:02,059
internship in high-tech companies and

561
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:04,129
big corporations so with so we talked a

562
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,930
little bit about what we want the kids

563
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:10,220
to do so let's see a couple of examples

564
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:12,050
of course again it's only a short list

565
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,020
of examples of things that kids can do

566
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,730
here there is a project which is main

567
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,650
goal was to create a CFG

568
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,130
a code-wall flow graph in Linux from

569
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:25,550
binary files with no source code that

570
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:30,500
specific project was conducted by 14 and

571
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:32,210
15 years old kids I have to say have to

572
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,950
bring a lot of time in Italy not a lot

573
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,970
not a lot of people in this we can say

574
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:40,160
what is safe Jean and what is the elect

575
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,679
but if you think about it kids can do a

576
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,730
lot of things here they took the binary

577
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,210
file disassembled them identified basic

578
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:52,640
blocks like function query logs and

579
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:55,850
jumps and calls created a visualization

580
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:02,210
of the application and use that to

581
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:06,250
identify part of the application based

582
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:10,390
on previous analysis for example

583
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:14,360
encryption methods for example sorting

584
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:17,179
algorithm another example is the network

585
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,870
may a mapping application in which kids

586
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,230
again

587
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:24,169
for 14 and 15 years old created an

588
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,540
application that leveraged passive and

589
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:29,270
active fingerprints to identify

590
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,750
operating system and of course most of

591
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:35,360
the things that they did was to research

592
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,540
other things that I would that were

593
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,409
already done for example press a other

594
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,080
tax in Def Con black egg and others

595
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:47,210
based on that they create that specific

596
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,030
visualization and you can see that every

597
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:54,370
orange circle is lying

598
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:57,340
every blue circle is windows and that's

599
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,629
at all there are many more projects the

600
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,550
thing which is the most it will stay

601
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,450
here and not the name of the project

602
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:09,550
which probably have some something not

603
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:13,750
the description but the age and also we

604
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:18,270
we had specific groups which were girls

605
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:23,980
only and the connection by the way

606
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:27,070
between the age of the participants and

607
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:30,040
the goal of the projects at the

608
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,530
beginning we thought we can't achieve

609
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,909
that but if you think about it 15 and 16

610
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,760
years boys and girls

611
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:38,340
created applications for anomaly

612
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,820
detection based on machine learning

613
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,129
sandbox implementation syscall analysis

614
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:49,659
and others and of course there are many

615
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,610
more projects but the core job the goals

616
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,740
of the project is not only to do the

617
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,399
projects but honest all also to learn

618
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:02,620
new technology aspects but not only that

619
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:05,440
we also want to create a nurture the

620
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,000
soft skills and because of that you can

621
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,580
see that one of the things that that

622
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,470
those kids learn as part of doing the

623
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,210
Wilbert project was collaboration and of

624
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:18,520
course other technical aspect in which

625
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:21,300
you can read now mach TF 2070 as you can

626
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,710
see when we presented some of the

627
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,830
project that conducted by teenagers in

628
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,500
the formally informally educational

629
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,330
system but this is even more informal

630
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:35,350
than the informal educational system so

631
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,629
MUC TF 2017 was conducted was organized

632
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,719
a I think one year ago it was organized

633
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:44,410
by Knox al which is a security group I

634
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,510
am part of M it was a city of event

635
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,280
organized form achieving which is a

636
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:53,050
program that was presented a couple of

637
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:54,910
slides and before that for graduates of

638
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,120
the program of action and it was

639
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,650
organized by this by students that are

640
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,469
learning at the currently learning in

641
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,890
maximum both in the eleventh grade and

642
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,490
Bo

643
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,020
12 quid so what is interesting here is

644
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,460
not the event itself event itself had

645
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,050
challenges in many topics such as web

646
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,150
exploitation binary exploitation it was

647
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,100
a CTF yeah something that most of you

648
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,170
are familiar with but the thing that is

649
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,570
interesting here that in Israel and

650
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:23,080
specifically in this event we have a

651
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:27,310
great example of how the education

652
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,600
system give the opportunity to teenagers

653
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:32,429
who are currently learning in the same

654
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,659
educational system to give and challenge

655
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:39,460
graduates of the same educational system

656
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:40,840
so these young people in my team had to

657
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,910
learn a lot of topics a lot of

658
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,040
interesting attack surfaces and a lot of

659
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,570
different attack methods in order to

660
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,370
create interesting challenges that can

661
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,950
challenge people that are graduate of

662
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:56,320
the same program they didn't finish yet

663
00:31:49,950 --> 00:32:01,450
will present more about Excel later ok

664
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,220
so while doing and providing new

665
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,040
knowledge to the to those Pacific

666
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,960
teenager we saw that there is problem

667
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,720
regarding the mental model if you think

668
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,700
about what a decision making process is

669
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,380
composed of so we have the processing

670
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,110
power of a brain we have the amount of

671
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,490
time that we have to decide or to act we

672
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,399
have the information that we have our

673
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:26,410
knowledge but because cyber security is

674
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:29,250
so complex there are cases in which an

675
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:32,520
allele mental model is created and

676
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:37,840
because of that we thought how can we

677
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:43,650
create challenges and tools and pedagogy

678
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:47,169
a pedagogical aspects which enable us to

679
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:49,390
to find out specific cognitive conflicts

680
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:52,020
and one of the ways that we decided to

681
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,570
do that is to leverage what is called

682
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,270
conflict based learning in which we by

683
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,740
design create conflicts to enable

684
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,560
learning and let's show a couple of

685
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,940
examples for that first of all here you

686
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,270
can see a chance that we gave not

687
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,610
specific students in which we took the

688
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,470
section of e.l.f which is responsible

689
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,600
for describing what is the interpreter

690
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:16,000
or the loader which is which is needed

691
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,939
to load a specific file and we modify

692
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,460
that

693
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,780
while executing the program of course it

694
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:25,340
won't be executed as needed

695
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:29,180
we gave the specific file to the 12

696
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:32,480
participants and the goal was to build a

697
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,220
mental model how loading is being

698
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,320
conducting the operating system because

699
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,220
to fix that specific problem you can

700
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,409
guess you can't do a bootful problem and

701
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,930
they need to understand how the process

702
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,100
is operating the same we did in another

703
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:50,750
challenge in which as part of the Cisco

704
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,929
mechanism we replaced the Cisco lock

705
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,630
code with the Scituate opcode and of

706
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:59,090
course the Cisco wasn't called as needed

707
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:02,170
because we changed the opcode a small

708
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:07,490
change can make a big difference and

709
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:11,060
because of that we had the ability to

710
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,980
reshape their mental model after those

711
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:17,719
challenges and I only showed a couple of

712
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,610
example of them the students from the

713
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,449
ninth and tenth grade had a better

714
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:24,860
understanding of the LF file format what

715
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:28,879
the defend between segments and sections

716
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:31,010
how system codes really work how to use

717
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,170
a debugger how to use the disassembly

718
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,480
how to use supporting tools to analyze

719
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,310
these binary formats and we did the same

720
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,440
for networking and we did the cell phone

721
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,799
programming for and from others and we

722
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,790
saw that the config based learning is so

723
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,460
important to such a domain which is so

724
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:53,570
complex and has a lot of NIT admitted

725
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:56,150
details because the converter because

726
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,400
the conference is being held in there in

727
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,380
Europe and in the UK we wanted to give a

728
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,900
couple of example what is going on here

729
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,970
of course that also a lot of examples

730
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,130
which are from the US and other places

731
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,430
which are not being detailed here the

732
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,690
first one is teen tech which is focus on

733
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,990
science engineering and technology and

734
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,740
to give young teenagers and

735
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:18,709
understanding what are the opportunities

736
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:23,029
there they also have the same thing for

737
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:26,810
cybersecurity you can see a different

738
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:29,870
headlines on the screen which shows the

739
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:33,590
huge importance that the UK gives

740
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:37,549
- cool - educate those teenagers in

741
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:41,360
cybersecurity when the screen is not

742
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:43,550
flickering of course and another example

743
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,750
for that is that is a specific college

744
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,780
that is going to be open

745
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,450
probably in 2020 in the UK by the way in

746
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,570
Bletchley Park some kind of a good story

747
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:56,779
for that in which they are going to

748
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,730
nature the best of the best in

749
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:02,600
cybersecurity in the UK of course there

750
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:06,200
are also other progress especially in

751
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:09,230
the UK such as cyber first started saw a

752
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,569
discovery which we did a detail here the

753
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,910
main goal is not to give you a detailed

754
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:16,280
explanation of each one of them is to

755
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,049
give you an understanding that also

756
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,860
governments are understanding the

757
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:25,790
importance of that issue so now we'll

758
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:31,370
try to present a case study or an

759
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:33,410
example of how you can educate teenagers

760
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,850
or our education of teenagers can be

761
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,250
done not true

762
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,170
educational systems or not true formal

763
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,180
educational system the example would be

764
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,070
example of mine I am the founder of

765
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,770
topsail and I'm part of MOOCs are now

766
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:50,510
try to give you an example give you a

767
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:52,250
sense of why teenagers despite their

768
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,110
young age can do whatever they want and

769
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:58,010
they are not different in any way than

770
00:36:54,110 --> 00:37:00,500
adults so what is nukes on Knox al is a

771
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,170
teenager security group it's a local

772
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,750
Israeli group which composed only of

773
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:08,840
local Israeli teenagers it is composed

774
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:10,850
of only passionate teenagers in cyber

775
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,930
security and computer science and we are

776
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,360
engaged in the creation and

777
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,759
participation of CTFs and spreading of

778
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,970
cybersecurity knowledge among our

779
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,820
community we do it by many ways by

780
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:27,020
corporate sales by volunteering lack

781
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:29,540
lectures and by other means so if we try

782
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,460
to ID or give a give a sense of what

783
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,560
Knox alleys and how many people are

784
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:37,880
there and and such so it was founded by

785
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,070
in 2016 two years ago by me and another

786
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,790
colleague which was also my teacher at

787
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,380
maximum

788
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,340
another great part of moksha meaning

789
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,180
that

790
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:49,340
graduates of the same program can teach

791
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:52,580
other students in the program so it was

792
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:54,980
my teacher and the number of members in

793
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:58,340
Excel are 15 in the global group and

794
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,250
another 35 in the city of group the age

795
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:03,200
range is mostly around 17 to 18 but

796
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,410
there are some that are 19 and also I

797
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,750
think already 20 some of us acti some of

798
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,450
our activities are blogs as I said city

799
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:14,210
of creations but the food the two things

800
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,980
that I want to mention here is community

801
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,790
education which is very important for us

802
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:23,030
and city of creation participation which

803
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,750
we are run currently around top 78 the

804
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:29,720
city of time will present later on

805
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:32,330
examples of community education so the

806
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:36,020
first event we organised was also the

807
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:38,630
first CTF ever organized by teenagers in

808
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,470
Israel it was a group of five or seven

809
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:46,130
see a very passionate and very very

810
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:48,319
passionate teenagers aged 16 to 17 years

811
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:51,550
old it was created with the support of

812
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,520
industry people helped us out a

813
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:57,740
community many communities that are

814
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,080
operating in Israel mostly adult

815
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,189
communities helped also and municipality

816
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,890
which sponsored the event and gave

817
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:08,120
prizes we had their challenges in many

818
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:10,279
topics again web a rating systems a

819
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,799
little bit of porn and this was our

820
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:17,090
first event I think a 50 people or 40

821
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,910
people participated in that event later

822
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:22,280
on we had the Knox cone which was our

823
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,690
first conference it was the ideal guy in

824
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,160
the conference it wasn't big or

825
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,040
something yes it's not like placket or

826
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:33,500
something but the idea behind it is that

827
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:36,200
teenagers are the speakers and the the

828
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:39,410
crowd that listened to these lectures

829
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:43,189
are also teenagers this conference said

830
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:44,810
30 people live and online we also

831
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,820
brought us at it on YouTube and I think

832
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:49,880
around 1,000 people from Israel

833
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,600
teenagers from Israel watched the

834
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,280
conference we had many talks 5 5 talks I

835
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,200
think about different topics such as our

836
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,359
say and they will never be

837
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,640
and even bioinformatics and machine

838
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:07,098
learning and it was very very successful

839
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,558
so the next example is community

840
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,150
education so as I said one of the main

841
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,819
goals one of the main things we think

842
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:17,059
very important is community education I

843
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:21,920
think that it's not enough to just have

844
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:24,230
knowledge or just to be experiencing in

845
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,930
projects or a wheel more technology it's

846
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:30,260
not enough you have to also spread the

847
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:33,319
knowledge you have among the the your

848
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,510
colleagues your community especially I

849
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:38,150
am that I was 16 when I founded a group

850
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,579
and now I'm 18 and I think that many of

851
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:44,119
my friends who learn with me in school

852
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:45,920
or a or in other programs are world even

853
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,250
familiar with the cybersecurity and what

854
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,829
is it so we conducted many many events

855
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:54,530
in order to teach and spread it to the

856
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:57,950
community we we created more than 30

857
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,420
programs across all Israel including

858
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,660
through the texture of our juniors event

859
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,569
a tech-savvy juniors organization which

860
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:10,520
helped us out we had more than 100

861
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:13,759
lectures and events which was with the

862
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,759
speaker war teenagers 16 years old 15

863
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,920
years old is amazing

864
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,599
three thousand teenagers been exposed to

865
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,380
these talks and learn about

866
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:27,849
cybersecurity through them I am myself

867
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:29,329
an example of this valley cybersecurity

868
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:31,819
educational program

869
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:34,180
I am the graduate of maximum I'm the

870
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:36,829
graduate of the great effort in Israel

871
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,770
the greater for doing in Israel in order

872
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:41,119
to evolve these security experts I've

873
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,299
started to work in the industry at

874
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,339
PayPal at 16 years old during my high

875
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:48,799
school time I found an ox are doing my

876
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:51,950
school time and I'm the proof that

877
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:53,630
everything is possible it's possible if

878
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,040
you really want and if you really want

879
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,040
to innovate if you really want to create

880
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,020
something from scrap you can do it and

881
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,970
it doesn't matter how many what is your

882
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,960
age if you are 15 years or 16 years old

883
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:08,000
or if you are 26 or 40 for some of you

884
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,609
are parents I think this is a message

885
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,599
that can be a very

886
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:16,910
important for any photo kids so another

887
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,150
event that we have created is Knox ETF

888
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,519
which was our first online CTF it was

889
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:25,150
conducted three months ago exactly it

890
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:28,399
was online CTF with many different

891
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,319
challenges many different topics and we

892
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,569
had nine hundred teams from all around

893
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,700
the world our first on a CTF of first

894
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:37,700
the first Israeli team we which ever

895
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,180
organized the city of non-additive four

896
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:44,629
thousand people took part and this only

897
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,489
proves that in one year change you can

898
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:50,059
go from 50 participants in an event that

899
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:57,079
is just an idea to a global event which

900
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:59,930
is a success so now we'll try to show

901
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:02,210
you how you can participate and help the

902
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,970
industry the community to solve these

903
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,220
problems we showed you here and on the

904
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:10,038
presentation it's about our future

905
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:13,368
thinking or how we can see you take part

906
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:16,940
in that so first of all organize

907
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:19,309
practical learning events do CTF

908
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,849
strainings competition and any other

909
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:24,619
idea you have for the community in order

910
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:27,140
to expose those computer science

911
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:29,299
graduates and those teenagers to cyber

912
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,828
security give them the practical

913
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:37,309
experience they need in order to become

914
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:39,259
cyber security experts and another

915
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:42,680
another great thing is you need to

916
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:44,630
mentor teenagers you all are experts you

917
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,288
understand in cybersecurity you work in

918
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,730
the industry but it's not enough

919
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:52,130
try to maybe talk with your school to

920
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,349
have a one lesson with the ninth graders

921
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,759
tenth graders give them a talk about

922
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:59,329
cybersecurity about the industry what

923
00:43:55,759 --> 00:44:01,940
you do how do you influence the world

924
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:05,210
how you change it for the better and how

925
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:07,430
can they also be part of that the third

926
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,499
one the same thing is help teenagers

927
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:13,009
teenagers security groups in your

928
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:15,558
community sponsor them not with money

929
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:18,739
give them the place to see it together

930
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:22,640
learn together participate in second

931
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:24,230
city apps together and create stuff by

932
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,700
themselves

933
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,190
and the fourth and most important thing

934
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,549
is collaborate collaborate with the

935
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,740
educational system to do two things

936
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:36,079
first is exposed teenagers to in the

937
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,060
industry and the industry to teenagers

938
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,060
one of the biggest problem we found and

939
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:44,119
I felt it myself is that teenagers are

940
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,299
not aware what is going on out there in

941
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,040
the industry they have their educational

942
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,650
system they go to school that's the only

943
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,779
thing they know but later on when they

944
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,290
finish college they know there is a wall

945
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:00,260
there is companies on Facebook and one

946
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:02,540
of the important thing is to expose them

947
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:05,150
and show them what is the real world and

948
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:09,109
that it is not so different from what

949
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,430
they think now in their life the second

950
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,578
thing is exposed to industry to

951
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:15,470
teenagers give them the opportunity to

952
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:16,730
internship in your companies give them

953
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,848
the opportunity to work in your

954
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:21,349
companies to learn from you to get the

955
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,560
right experience that will help them

956
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:33,710
also in 80 18 or 16 years old to work in

957
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:35,328
the industry so so basically you can see

958
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,390
a couple of example how can we upgrade

959
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:41,000
our chronic Alcorn approach how can we

960
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:43,069
expose more teenagers maybe we will

961
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,710
start at first grade and I and not and

962
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:48,710
not fight a fifth grade or sixth way we

963
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:51,050
extol let's expose more middle school

964
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,819
girls to cybersecurity leaders let's

965
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:55,450
teach Kyle cutting-edge technology and

966
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:58,420
of course let's invest more in the

967
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:01,848
concept in which we teach our children

968
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:04,520
so let me summarize the presentation

969
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:07,099
with the black head sound bytes so the

970
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,170
first one is remember the DOS yes this

971
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:11,869
is very important first one is you stage

972
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:15,319
is the most suitable for education in

973
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:17,140
cyber security as you as we showed you

974
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:19,160
earlier in Israel it's working great

975
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,118
people are starting to work in the

976
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,609
industry are getting the right

977
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,650
experience and are getting the right

978
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:28,279
expertise they need in order to work in

979
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:31,880
the industry and to be real experts the

980
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,730
second thing is a full package education

981
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:38,090
system in cybersecurity for teenagers is

982
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,920
the only way and we can aid but

983
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:42,440
is the only way for from our perspective

984
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:47,060
to solving the workforce shortage we

985
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,190
have to give them the tools even when

986
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,060
they are teenagers and the third thing

987
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:55,010
is cooperation cooperation and

988
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,320
cooperation cooperation between

989
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,360
community and industry is the only key

990
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:03,130
to achieving this goal and close this

991
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:09,710
shortage remember 85 million people

992
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:11,150
shortage in 2013 and where we will sum

993
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,460
up with a couple of things which are not

994
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,440
only for teenagers most of the talk we

think about it a day that you didn't

1000
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:32,359
