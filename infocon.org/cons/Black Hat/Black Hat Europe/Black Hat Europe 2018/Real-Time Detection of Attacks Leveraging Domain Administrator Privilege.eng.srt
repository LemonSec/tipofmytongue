1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,450
hey everyone good afternoon I'm impact

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,950
at home its Naga I'm really lucky to be

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:14,370
here because my two days ago my fright

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:17,520
Narita to here was the shelter then I

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,609
got reassigned flight to yesterday but

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,698
it was delayed so I'm not sure I think

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,510
I'm here but finally I'm here so I'm

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,420
glad to see you all thank you our title

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,030
is a real-time detection of attack

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,649
Rivers degree domain administrator

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,840
pre-baked knew our talk focuses on

12
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:44,250
Active Directory and the machine

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,149
learning we are from University of Tokyo

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,670
and back home it's Naga and Vitaly

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:57,360
Matsuda and America Yugi moto

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:01:00,960
we will search in the talk so University

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,379
we're doing a research on cyber security

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,119
or a security FinTech security and we

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,549
are also providing cyber security

20
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,040
training not only for students but also

21
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,490
industrial people or government the

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,189
people we sometimes published book or

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,240
research papers and our new books will

24
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,419
be published next to you so this is

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,280
agenda of our talk first

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:33,150
we explain purpose and background as an

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,090
introduction and then we talk about

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,900
previous research and proposed method

29
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,229
which is combining sugar based detection

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,140
and the machine running then we'll show

31
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:51,360
you the demonstration our method and the

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,890
tourists then concludes so other

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,740
introduction in the targeted attack

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:03,119
Active Directory tend to be a target but

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,969
occurs because if they get the mini

36
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,770
administrator account Xing can control

37
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,950
everything inside Eddy environment

38
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,720
and the after they obtained

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,839
administrator account

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:22,340
sometimes they create backdoor called

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,480
wouldn't get it is not so easy to detect

42
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,180
the golden ticket obvious because they

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,359
use golden ticket they can disguise

44
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:37,910
themselves as a resonate domain

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:41,060
administrator so in this talk we will

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,640
explain the tools and the detection

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,200
method which is combining a signature

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,899
base and massive running detection using

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,630
analyzing the event of route to detect

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:59,780
attacker activities including golden

51
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:01,760
ticket so once Active Directory active

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,340
directory is a centralized management

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:11,840
system or Windows computers and accounts

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:15,820
if you use any environment it is so easy

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:20,600
and effective to control machine and

56
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:25,519
accounts so many companies use the

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:29,720
domain environment but on the other hand

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:33,110
if attacker get a dooming account in

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:39,100
domain they can control everything

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:44,000
so ad tend to be a target for attackers

61
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:49,010
so this is example flow of attacking

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,200
Eddy after attacker interviewed inside

63
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:58,220
network there they try to get try to

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,880
obtain the ad environment this is number

65
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,000
three under after they can get any

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,960
account idea Demi account they try to

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,680
move different servers rack file server

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,260
this is number four because after they

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,450
get at me account they can move to

70
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:22,500
everywhere inside ad domain

71
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,849
in our presentation we focuses on the

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:34,530
phase 3 and phase 4 which is attacking

73
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:38,730
ad domain controllers so Gordon's get is

74
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:45,390
the backdoor against the ad which is

75
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:48,710
introduced Blackwater USA 2014 if they

76
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:52,530
create this guerrilla to get back door

77
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:56,130
they can use golden ticket for wrong

78
00:04:52,530 --> 00:05:02,789
time like 10 years and they can pretend

79
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:08,340
as rhythmic admin account so it isn't so

80
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:13,460
easy to find what is it to detect the

81
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:17,280
attackers activity this is the image of

82
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:21,630
how to explain the difficulty of a

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,049
dedicated orange get the roofed one the

84
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:29,940
green a low means their usual operation

85
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:32,220
by limited me account they use the

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,210
account to domain controller and the

87
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:40,710
account name is DC Adam II and the left

88
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:43,109
one is attack activities after you they

89
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:46,099
interviewed the network they can get the

90
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,370
compromised account to write to user 101

91
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:53,640
and then they use if they use govern

92
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:58,470
hCAP they can pretend this girl's

93
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:03,270
account with a privilege like a DC Adam

94
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:06,510
E and then they use their this guy's

95
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:10,020
account with domain controller so in

96
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,289
terms of domain controller monitoring it

97
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,070
is not easy to tell the difference

98
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,850
between usual operation and the Ithaca

99
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,849
activities

100
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:34,490
that means the windows commands in

101
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,530
addition to attack tours for instance in

102
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,039
this case an attacker impersonates

103
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,559
himself as a domain administrator DC at

104
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,889
me and then removed access to the domain

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,699
controller and execute some windows

106
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:52,400
commands such as IP config and these

107
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:56,150
activities are recorded in a domain

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,460
controllers event logs but if the

109
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,520
teammate domain administrator also use

110
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,620
the same command so it is difficult to

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,609
differentiate attackers acquit

112
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:11,360
activities from normal operations from

113
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:15,440
event logs so this is our proposal

114
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:20,060
mossad so we implemented a real-time

115
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,099
detection tool for attack activities by

116
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,430
virtue domain administrator privilege

117
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,800
including golden ticket and our tools

118
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,130
yun use full signature based detection

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,400
and machine learning but because and

120
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:38,090
they have advantages and disadvantages

121
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,630
and the signature breadth detection can

122
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,388
eard

123
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:45,199
high recall rate by using several

124
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,840
signatures but on the other hand a first

125
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,139
positive can occur depending on the

126
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,198
developer ations then so our to

127
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,779
reanalyze the rocks by using machine

128
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,199
running in order to reduce a false

129
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:05,000
positive rate by comparing rocks with

130
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:08,690
daily operations so this is a problems

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,330
of the signature base infections so we

132
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:15,830
have a bra creased over some windows

133
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,990
command but for instance IP config is a

134
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,960
one-off command into progressed

135
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,690
so if rich tomato domain administrator

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,930
use IP config in their operations

137
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:31,339
signature based detection as detects it

138
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,690
is attacks because IP config is included

139
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,269
in the forest

140
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,839
on the other hand a machine-learning can

141
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:43,099
detect it is normal because

142
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:45,769
ipconfig is used in daily operations so

143
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,399
this is a structure of our proposal

144
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:52,370
method so when someone access to the

145
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,100
domain controller the activities are

146
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,779
recorded in the event log on the domain

147
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,490
controller and blogs are sent to the

148
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:05,300
absorber in real-time

149
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:09,079
and at first a looks is analyzed by the

150
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,649
signature based detection and then next

151
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:16,089
Android's by the machine running and if

152
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:19,370
any attack activities are detected our

153
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:24,170
system center of words to system

154
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:28,720
administrator so we used only domain

155
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:32,149
controllers event logs for input data so

156
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,410
activities occurred in Windows systems

157
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:39,980
are recorded in event works on each

158
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:43,360
computers but it is not realistic to

159
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:48,110
investigate event rocks of all computers

160
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,839
so the reason why we focused on the

161
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,329
domain controllers event log is a to

162
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:57,009
pretend to access the domain controller

163
00:09:53,329 --> 00:10:01,699
in order to create golden ticket and

164
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:04,550
there are a lot of event IDs but we only

165
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:07,189
used a specific events so which

166
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:12,889
attackers activities which golden ticket

167
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:16,399
are recorded so we extract and this

168
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:22,160
following the data items and used for

169
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:27,370
input at first we explain about

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:31,279
signature based detection and severe

171
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:35,029
existing approaches have been proposed

172
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,899
but we found that a several approaches

173
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,639
are needed in order to detect a

174
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:44,360
sophisticated attack such as golden

175
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,630
ticket so we pick up a severe use for

176
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,270
existing message

177
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:53,189
and organize a specific detection

178
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:56,220
signatures like this at first a

179
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,580
signature is monitors are expected

180
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,560
administrative privileges it is useful

181
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,490
food and detecting a privilege

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,650
escalation by an activities so there is

183
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:12,180
a very famous vulnerabilities or

184
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:16,079
privilege escalation so Amazon 14 + 6 8

185
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:20,069
so it is used in many targeted attacks

186
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,790
and this signature is relatively easy to

187
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:28,680
detect so it is useful for detect attack

188
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:31,500
activities in every stage and a civil

189
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,229
service monitors execution of the see

190
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,860
arrow I tools which attack or tend to

191
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:41,670
use so at occurs sometime use a Windows

192
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,460
command such as net or 80 etc so in

193
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:49,290
order to expand infections or steal

194
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:52,560
informations so we register this command

195
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:56,280
and in the practice because this command

196
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,069
are tend to be used by attackers but

197
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,310
these are a burrito in Windows command

198
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,340
so legitimate administrator also use

199
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,819
these commands so in these situations of

200
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:14,280
course forces can occur so that's why we

201
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:17,250
utilize machine running so signature see

202
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,209
use the monitors the use of

203
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,620
administrative shell resource

204
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,800
administrative share resource is a

205
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,740
special hidden and network services and

206
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,800
attacker often use administrative shell

207
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:37,640
in order to touch at actors or steal

208
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,319
information and to nature these monitors

209
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,420
suspicious caravels

210
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,320
authentication of which is suspected to

211
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,170
accordion to get attacks then attacker

212
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,690
use a golden ticket

213
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:55,790
TCT requests events are not to record it

214
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,790
before the service request

215
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:05,729
so from here water we've explained about

216
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,880
machine running oh I'll see mentioned

217
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,160
the using using breast lead to false

218
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,350
positive so we compare robust with the

219
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,939
daily operations to reduce false

220
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,290
positive but it's difficult to create or

221
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,290
men maintained of white restore

222
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:25,019
characteristic manually so app reporter

223
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:28,439
method it learning a daily operations

224
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:31,019
using unsupervised machine learning our

225
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,130
system not only daily operation works

226
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:37,949
we don't need attack rogues if our

227
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:42,540
system detect unusual behavior it can be

228
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:45,750
attack you behavior this red shows over

229
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,449
V of detection after all supported me so

230
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,269
to learn only domain controller event

231
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:54,930
rocks related to the process because at

232
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:58,350
akkad activity is recorded as the event

233
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:02,699
related to the process so we've we focus

234
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:05,490
on process almond so to use unsupervised

235
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:08,880
learning to to detect on user command

236
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,000
execution on this assist should be the

237
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,399
inventor was only of the normal state

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,269
she do not containers of an attack this

239
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,550
is premise and we use eventuaiiy domain

240
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:24,269
controllers even drops ID four six eight

241
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,430
eight and four six seven four four six

242
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:29,699
eight eight has or executed cannot

243
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,729
information on the other hand four seven

244
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:35,609
four husband specific command

245
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:38,519
information but it has detail

246
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:43,800
information so we use both event ID for

247
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:46,170
both data set we need pre process we

248
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,729
discovered some data commonly included

249
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,699
in if every raagas

250
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,040
vigorous of environment because they are

251
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:56,760
user s they had no future for detection

252
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,149
of example addresses and services dot X

253
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,699
they are discarded and we combat from

254
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:08,069
character to numbers using one hot

255
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:11,800
encoding but we know with one cross s um

256
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:14,618
it is an unsupervised algorithm

257
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,829
it optimizes decision function for

258
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:20,050
mobility detection with only one level

259
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:23,109
and we we've already adjusted hyper

260
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:28,779
parameter to get best to result in real

261
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:31,449
and gamma are hyper parameters and we

262
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:36,279
evaluate using this metric precision and

263
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:38,649
recall so this is a result of detection

264
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,269
rate but you can see machine learning

265
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,509
reduce false positive

266
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:48,519
so only signature-based the number of

267
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:51,489
cores per chip is 17 but combination of

268
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:56,799
signature and machine learning so for

269
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:59,709
specific only six as a result we

270
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:03,910
achieved the prison rate its husband

271
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:09,699
improved we achieved the modern 90% to

272
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:12,879
the core and prison rate we implement

273
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:15,790
our proposal method using elastic stock

308
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,330
80 per month in daily operations and

309
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,949
destroy Isis attack outside attack hub

310
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,669

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,420
the domain controller the signature

322
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,580
based detection can detect on 84 mod

323
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,760
successfully because it's on the brach

324
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,220
forest machine gun also detect 80

325
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,490
command because it's not it's not the

326
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:03,460

system send email to security operators

328
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,580
okay now you will see at this moment

329
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:20,720
first no I'll show the a socket activity

330
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:25,550
attack outside so now you are watching

331
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,500
the current OPC and I can to them it

332
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,950
becomes a tea this is the row car user

333
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,460

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:55,639
ticket attacker in tech - Gordon

339
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:58,760
staccato into the memory no so if this

340
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,490
is a golden ticket information here the

341
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,500
trying to name it to DC Auto me using

342
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:07,659
this domain using this golden ticket

343
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:11,480
attacker can impersonate as DC attorney

344
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:14,270
and here the expiration year date is

345
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:22,070
very wrong almost 10 years is the

346
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:24,320
characteristic of the cordon ticket and

347
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,950
the attacker access the domain

348
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,330
controller using PSD common TSM

349
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:36,890
decreased demote access to attack access

350
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:39,710
to domain controller successfully if the

351
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,169
desert of who Amari attacker in count

352
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:46,450
this impersonator at DC Adam

353
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:49,250
successfully in this situation attack

354
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,820
attack attack attack attack tivity is

355
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,549
recorded as DC Ottomans activity an

356
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,700
attacker can execute any commando one

357
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:03,080
attacker want to do but in this

358
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:06,230
demonstration attack I use 80 command 80

359
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:11,030
command is used for used for tasks

360
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:15,710
schedule management attacker executive

361
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:18,200
cannot for investigation okay next let's

362
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:22,100
take a look at defend outside Security

363
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,039
administrative display here this given

364
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,350
key panel shows Windows Event office and

365
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,860
you can insult attack crooks easily

366
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:35,539
using filtering function now we filter

367
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:37,490
and the keyboard attack here you can

368
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,070
easily find out what was going on on the

369
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,640
domain controller 80 commando is

370
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:46,490
executed but it's very difficult to keep

371
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,200
watching keep on a display so our system

372
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:53,090
send email

373
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:57,060
for notification you receive the email

374
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,919
uncivil Judas with several emails Adil

375
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,700
cancel you can see several signatures a

376
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:06,750
lot and this is the last email this

377
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,570
e-mail tell you the executed executed

378
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,180
process name and compromised IP address

379
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:15,570
and account this information very is

380
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:17,160
very important very beautiful to respond

381
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,370
against computer security incident

382
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:27,540
quickly our demonstration is all thank

383
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:30,780
you so this our consideration of force

384
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,480
detections at first a first- can occur

385
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,030
if the offering and conditions are

386
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,340
satisfied at the same time at first

387
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,920
attacker use the same command with

388
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,320
legitimate administrator and second

389
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,150
attacker compromised resume to me

390
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,270
administrator accounts and their

391
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:51,120
computers because in these situations

392
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,639
there is no difference between autocracy

393
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,969
activities and resubmit administrators

394
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,370
activities in event rocks and avert or

395
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,340
cannot detect the Windows command which

396
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:05,010
are not included in the perk rest but in

397
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,530
these difficult situations there is a

398
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:10,050
possibility that our Mossad can detect

399
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,800
attack because etapa uses a similar

400
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:18,180
command not only single command and we

401
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,360
prepare several signatures and next the

402
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:24,120
first footstep can occur if commands

403
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,969
that are not frequently used in daily

404
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,580
operations are used by attackers so

405
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:33,210
avert sir need a certain period for

406
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,639
running normal operations so this is a

407
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,070
conclusions the abuse of a domain

408
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,200
administrator private means a pocket of

409
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,270
Directory environment is a flow control

410
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,850
of attackers so we need immediate

411
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:48,240
actions but a detection is very

412
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:50,699
difficult if a legitimate account and

413
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,330
windows command are abused like a

414
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,850
coordinated attacks and our message can

415
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,090
detect attacks even if the difficult

416
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,740
situation in timely manner so our tour

417
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,730
here

418
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,620
our immediate in incident response and

419
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,169
for future works we are planning to

420
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,020
analyze the appendix of a client

421
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:18,590
computers for further investigation and

422
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:21,470
we published our detection tools on on

423
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:25,129
our github it's free to use for

424
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,929
reference and if you have any questions

425
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:32,919
please contact this email and we are

426
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:37,070
going to introduce our detection tools

427
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:40,730
in an Arsenal section tomorrow so if you

428
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:43,789
have interested in our missile so please

429
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:46,360
visit our pers so thank you for about

430
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,360
tensions

431
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,809
