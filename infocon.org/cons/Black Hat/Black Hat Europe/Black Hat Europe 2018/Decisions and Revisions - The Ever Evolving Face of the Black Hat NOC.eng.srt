1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,299
hi who are we

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:11,820
so I'm grifter I have been involved with

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,009
blackhat or taking care of the technical

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,809
operations for blackhat for all the

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,609
shows around the world for the last 16

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,650
years

7
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,300
I'm Bart or stump her some call me and I

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,939
have been around 11 years writing this

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,269
guy's coattails so so yeah so we we got

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,750
involved long long ago when when

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,379
honestly the let's see this show was 250

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,090
people

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,070
this show was that's that's about the

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,660
size for any regional show it was one we

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,450
used to be an Amsterdam which I miss

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:49,500
greatly nothing against London but you

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:53,570
know Amsterdam so the u.s. show at the

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,539
time was also about 1000 to 1200 people

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,870
now the u.s. show is about 20,000 so the

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,780
network has morphed and changed to adapt

21
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:08,759
to those things and we're the guys who

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:13,409
do that we don't do it alone though so

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,659
in the early days of blackhat we used to

24
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,439
roll everything our own alright so we

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,110
just bought consumer equipment and we

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,758
tried to make things work the first

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,189
blackout shows that I was involved in we

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,680
had like a Cisco 2600 and then some

29
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,529
Cisco APs with the external antennas you

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,600
would tape on the walls so we we had

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,119
that going for us and then we had to

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,949
keep scaling things at one point we were

33
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,380
shipping 65 so Chris boxes to whatever

34
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,500
show we were going to running OpenBSD

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,970
and PF and writing custom scripts for

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,649
them to call home and tell us they were

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,060
alive or what was going on on the

38
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,420
network that didn't work after a certain

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,579
amount of time and so a few years ago

40
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,920
barton myself said man we really need

41
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,929
like enterprise-grade gear I get this

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,180
network it's just you know it's too hard

43
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,700
to keep it from tipping over maybe we

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,530
should go down the expo hall and ask a

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,239
vendor down

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,790
if they would be willing to like give us

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,140
some gear right so that's what we did we

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,790
went down the expo hall and we talked to

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,070
the first vendor and we were like so hi

50
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,900
we run the blackhat knock and we were

51
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,690
wondering if you would be interested in

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,600
helping us with and they were like yes

53
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,000
you know and so we're like cool all

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,739
right cool this is gonna be fun right so

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,230
then we were like let's go shoppin and

56
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,330
we like wandered the expo hall and talk

57
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,060
to the different folks who we wanted to

58
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,590
work with and everybody said yes they

59
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,300
wanted to be involved so it's been great

60
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,640
so they are partners they're not

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,110
sponsors they may be sponsors a show but

62
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,160
they're not sponsors of the NOC they

63
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,260
actually no one can pay to have their

64
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,510
equipment be part of the not that as a

65
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,609
decision we make us a NOC team and

66
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,350
decide what we're gonna bring in and

67
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,470
that has changed over the years there

68
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,079
are vendors where the technology didn't

69
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,970
do what we hoped it would do or it

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,850
didn't scale to what we needed to scale

71
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,970
to or in some cases they just had over

72
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,739
excited marketing teams who wanted to

73
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,269
say that they ran the NOC at blackhat

74
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,299
and then now they're not involved at all

75
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:19,190
so I'm gonna have a nice thing yeah so

76
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:23,060
it's like get your marketing teams in

77
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:26,540
check why they will spoil your technical

78
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,060
relationships so we like I said we had

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,739
to scale these are the folks that we're

80
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,049
working with today and have been working

81
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:38,180
with I think it's this this crew for the

82
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,400
last two two-and-a-half years we get

83
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,140
some of their a list players their top

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,769
folks come out and help us out in the

85
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,380
NOC so we actually do work side-by-side

86
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,579
with their their folks to make

87
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,760
everything happen it's been pretty

88
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,760
awesome

89
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,280
that's us

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,720
oh my gosh we are so good-looking so

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,580
that's it that's the entire knock team

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,660
for this show we took this picture

93
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,580
yesterday again filling all of those not

94
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,069
partners as well as some of just the

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:17,220
core blackhat team that comes out and

96
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:18,719
does it so we told you guys we're gonna

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,570
talk about architecture came to any of

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,040
our smaller ones as well and there it is

99
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,510
you guys I think that's what holds it

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,490
together for him he never does an

101
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,190
architect like he like he does like

102
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,740
these really elaborate beautiful designs

103
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,790
for the u.s. show be thank so much stuff

104
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,979
thanks for covering for me

105
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,900
it's it looks but you know like you have

106
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,120
to have that and then for the regional

107
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,010
shows you like draws it on a napkin so I

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,900
just started putting this in and just

109
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:48,060
this show he was like alright I'll start

110
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,560
doing so to that extent and we'll cover

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
it a bit I mean everything's pretty

112
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,150
fluid and there's a lot of things that

113
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,040
change whether we get on site and

114
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,020
something breaks or doesn't break or it

115
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,729
was expected or unexpected when we were

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,280
on a new version one place and not

117
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,099
another then there's certainly issues

118
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,409
that we run into so I'd be rewriting

119
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,940
that diagram 22 different times and it

120
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,400
you know we kind of understand and it's

121
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,340
it's fluid Moore's but but obviously the

122
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,310
the complexities of the the us show with

123
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,169
that it gets a lot more in-depth but to

124
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,140
that point here's the architecture

125
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,190
basically that we have at this show so

126
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,960
basically what everybody does and we

127
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,630
showed the partners here Palo Alto runs

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,500
our core we have to PA 30 to 50 s in an

129
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,280
active/passive

130
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,820
h a pair Cisco provides us with umbrella

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,460
the OpenDNS acquisition as well as

132
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,990
threat grid that will detonate any of

133
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,430
the malware or anything else that we

134
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,889
need to and can interact in those sand

135
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,020
boxes with that malware to kind of

136
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,460
determine that good bad versus bad bad

137
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,530
as we'll talk about here in a little bit

138
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,859
ruckus provides all of our Wireless

139
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,679
throughout the venue's this we have 28

140
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,970
ApS from them with two controllers

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,150
running that RSA brings plenty of gear

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,950
to basically they provide all of our

143
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,039
forensics as we run the net witness

144
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,469
suite they provide our forensics

145
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,759
as well as endpoint on the registration

146
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,669
machines and a few other things that

147
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,210
we'll get into tons of gear that they

148
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,248
bring to capture all the packets that

149
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,568
traverse the network while on site will

150
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:22,369
also dig into that and I'll explain a

151
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:25,430
bit to you on that and then gigamon

152
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:27,649
provides our tapping solution to provide

153
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,960
those feeds Internet witness as well as

154
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,149
other open source tools that we have and

155
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,159
we'll show you some of that

156
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,960
what is um what's cool about this gear

157
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:39,680
again is like you know all these folks

158
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,539
bring it and we don't have like a real

159
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,419
it's and it's not like the best looking

160
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:47,990
set up back there hiding behind the

161
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:51,229
dividers we have literally put the gear

162
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,879
on luggage carts in the past I think the

163
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,308
RSA gear is it's sitting on a pallet

164
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,580
like a wooden pallet on the floor right

165
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:57,680
now

166
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,258
so we're talking about probably when

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,819
we're all all said and done you know a

168
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:06,020
million plus dollars worth of equipment

169
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:08,270
and and it's sitting on the floor or and

170
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,899
there's likelyhood oscillating fan is

171
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:15,878
leave it this blow to keep it cool but

172
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:18,620
you know so we're you know yeah and then

173
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,419
we have things happen like you know we

174
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,550
plug all this equipment in now we asked

175
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,899
for a certain number of amps you know

176
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,979
from the venue or like this is what

177
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:28,809
we're gonna need we're gonna be running

178
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:31,758
a lot of equipment but on setup day pop

179
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:34,219
we blow the circuit and everything it

180
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,949
got real quiet in the NOC right all the

181
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:39,319
fans turned off all the beeping stop

182
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,569
and we were like whoopsie so we needed

183
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,680
more power they came and gave us that so

184
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,110
now we're up and running and everything

185
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,740
seems great right then the ceiling

186
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,139
starts to drip this isn't on to the gear

187
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,759
like literally waterless if you if you

188
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,189
stopped by the NOC it's a relatively

189
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,339
large room right the water was dripping

190
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:00,349
directly above the equipment right so

191
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,639
you don't make it yeah you can't plan

192
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:07,490
for these things you just kind of have

193
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:10,669
to adapt so we got a bucket we got a

194
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,439
bucket yeah clearly we we move the

195
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,139
equipment over about a foot with a

196
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,159
bucket and put a bucket well what do you

197
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,279
do

198
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,080
I was like I didn't pay for this I'm

199
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,110
teasing somebody please bring your stuff

200
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,318
back guys I swear we take good care of

201
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,319
it

202
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:32,690
so you may have seen if you poked your

203
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,189
head in there we like shiny things we

204
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,800
have a lot of different dashboards and

205
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:40,069
stuff going on these particular

206
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,359
dashboards were set up on screens that

207
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:43,309
you could come into the NOC and look at

208
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,430
throughout the show and the data was

209
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:49,189
updated in real time to show what was

210
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,839
taking place on the network what you saw

211
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:55,009
in the middle they're going pew pew

212
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,910
everybody likes the pew pew right what

213
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:02,029
it is is here oh let me start it again

214
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:05,089
the green I'm gonna break it now there

215
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,430
we go the green data this is just the

216
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,529
active host on the network so there

217
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,969
these guys are awful chatty all right so

218
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,060
we're taking a look at that the green is

219
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,240
TCP the red is UDP icmp will be

220
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,540
reflected in white and what we use this

221
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,079
for is just watching if something lights

222
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,699
up like this or it gets wider the size

223
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,649
of the dot also represents the size of

224
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,660
the packet sorry so the amount of data

225
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,899
that we're seeing so if we're seeing a

226
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,149
somebody trying to das something or or

227
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,089
somebody just super abusing the

228
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:41,839
bandwidth then is waiting the network it

229
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:44,180
will light up really significantly and

230
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,310
so we know like hey we should maybe take

231
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,138
a look at what they're doing or when we

232
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,089
see scans what it actually looks like is

233
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,769
a starburst right because hitting a

234
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,949
bunch of different hosts and so one host

235
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:56,410
is just one so we just say look there's

236
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:59,269
somebody looking for something to do

237
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,040
quick visual feedback obviously whether

238
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,600
or not we needed to dig in more well I

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,949
should also say so the format of this is

240
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,759
we're gonna try to run through these

241
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:09,290
slides relatively quickly and then we we

242
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,730
try to give most people you 5 to 10

243
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,860
minutes for questions we try to do like

244
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:17,870
half the time oh well so these are some

245
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,569
other dashboards that ruckus provides

246
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,889
basically this is a spectrum analysis

247
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:25,130
between the two point four and five

248
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:26,209
gigahertz again you can not necessary

249
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,649
it's not necessarily anything that's

250
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,219
gonna tell us how somebody's hacking

251
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,649
somebody else or

252
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,269
to that extent it's it's quick visual

253
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,610
information that we can glance at as far

254
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,319
as a dashboard goes and then look in

255
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,850
further if we need to if there's any

256
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,670
issues and obviously digging with our

257
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:47,069
other tools and and forensics and get to

258
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:49,410
there but speaking of Wi-Fi here's

259
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,660
basically all the the quick stats that

260
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:58,050
we got from rockets and things that we

261
00:10:51,660 --> 00:11:01,290
saw so basically again we had Rincon

262
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,000
live in 1100 plus unique devices again

263
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,329
all of this depends you guys jump on the

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,689
Wi-Fi whether it's laptops and trainings

265
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:14,099
phones tablets on the general Wi-Fi

266
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:15,750
everything is on the wireless at that

267
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,120
point we don't have wired connections

268
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,970
here in these shows busiest device hit

269
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,720
about 50 gigs which is kind of small in

270
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,269
some extent busiest room it's always Sid

271
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,069
advanced infrastructure hacking they

272
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,720
were doing some fun stuff and we can dig

273
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:33,000
in you can see other clients the amounts

274
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,399
on each SSID etcetera and basically the

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,629
information we saw there so a healthy

276
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,259
amount of stats I wouldn't say that

277
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:44,160
anything abnormal that we saw more iOS

278
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:48,899
and Android more windows than Mac and a

279
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:53,250
whole bunch of Linux mixed in all right

280
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:55,170
so these are is our DNS stats so again

281
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,500
Cisco with umbrella we're getting all

282
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,540
kinds of good DNS data what we see and I

283
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,639
know it's hard because this projectors

284
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,809
bulb is going out but it's seven million

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:10,620
DNS requests for 2018 so that's up from

286
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:12,870
five point six and 2017 so more traffic

287
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,279
more going on there and what we see up

288
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,290
here is the stuff that we essentially

289
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,220
allowed right those are things that we

290
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,540
would go huh

291
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,569
like in a normal environment you

292
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,000
probably wouldn't care to allow that but

293
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:26,250
once again this is black hat so hashtag

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,710
Yolo sec

295
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,960
and then and we haven't really blocked

296
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,890
that but we've we blocked nothing

297
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,970
outbound of this network because of the

298
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,590
types of traffic that you're gonna see

299
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,420
flowing from labs and everything that

300
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,270
happens in trainings etc if we were to

301
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,069
block normal mal well or malware or

302
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,180
potentially harmful traffic that

303
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,030
everybody else would see in a normal

304
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,380
environment and block we don't because

305
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,910
we'd ruin a training or we'd ruin

306
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,410
someone's lab down at Arsenal or

307
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,880
whatever the case may be at that point

308
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:59,760
we we allow it to go unless otherwise

309
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,580
needed yeah and I mean sometimes we do

310
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,790
have to do that and we'll get into that

311
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,460
a little bit later um I actually I like

312
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,160
this gif I'm gonna talk about the gift I

313
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,020
like it because it's like oh it's gonna

314
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,760
evolve and then it doesn't like it makes

315
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,370
it like you're like come on like you

316
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,230
know there's no payoff it's just I got

317
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,940
your magic herb just a flop yeah just

318
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,190
piss me off

319
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,300
put it in there but yeah that says

320
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:33,060
ever-changing goals so when we initially

321
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,859
start or started doing the network the

322
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,939
thing that we really wanted to do was

323
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,260
just get it stable so when the Jeff Moss

324
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,180
who at the time was the owner of

325
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,760
blackhat called me up I had volunteered

326
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,969
at a single blackhat show prior to that

327
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,560
and he said hey we liked you we want you

328
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,860
to come and run the network you know you

329
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,660
can bring a team of people or whatever I

330
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,880
brought two guys which was a mistake and

331
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,550
there are three too many on the entire

332
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,260
network but the big thing was like

333
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,050
trying to keep the network up and that

334
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,730
first year the us show I had a 15 minute

335
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,109
outage over the entire length of the

336
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,089
show which I guess is pretty good for a

337
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,270
conference and then especially that

338
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:14,280
conference that 15-minute outage was one

339
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,620
of the trainers I was showing off a

340
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,939
zero-day in his class and when I happen

341
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,680
to check on the class at one point he

342
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,510
was like hey did the network go down and

343
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,930
I was like I hate you and your mom

344
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:29,120
so so stability is huge we want to make

345
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,510
sure you guys can actually use it from a

346
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,730
security standpoint our crown jewels to

347
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,189
us is the registration system right we

348
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,670
don't want your information getting out

349
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:43,160
there if somebody pops reg and now all

350
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,620
of the private information of you know

351
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,410
the foremost information security people

352
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,699
in the world is now out there I guess

353
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,029
you know black hat has to close its

354
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:55,430
doors right so it's a bit of high on our

355
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,350
faces so you know that that's important

356
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,638
to us then we started rolling into

357
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,660
things like segmentation you know

358
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,660
initially the network was flat which was

359
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:09,469
funny in the early years of black hat

360
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:13,430
and and it was definitely only the

361
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,410
strongest classes - right yeah it was

362
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,410
like are you brave enough and strong

363
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,579
enough to survive the black hat Network

364
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,730
but at a certain point some of the

365
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:24,949
classes were like genuinely like okay

366
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,769
here's this thing that we did let's try

367
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:30,560
that out on the class next door and so

368
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,870
we're like damn it you know like okay so

369
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,569
we you know we split up every training

370
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,790
class now so everybody gets their own

371
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:40,399
and then we do hosts isolation as well

372
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,949
we try to keep you guys from from

373
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,079
messing with each other but again if you

374
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:48,859
do and you're successful for the most

375
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:53,599
part we'll let it go we'll be like haha

376
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,370
very good so then we were we were

377
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,079
interested in and what was actually

378
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,430
taking place on the network what were

379
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,719
the things that maybe were missing that

380
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,750
we wanted to get eyes on we're like

381
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,839
what's what's actually happening how can

382
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,120
we get more intelligence into this

383
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,800
environment and so that's where we

384
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,240
started to look for a way to do threat

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,420
hunting in the environment and that's

386
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,880
where we brought in net witness so we

387
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,579
write all of the packets that traverse

388
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,100
the network to disks so I know there's a

389
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,649
gasp right it's not big brother II at

390
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,329
all it the reason that we do that is so

391
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,550
that if we see an anomaly we see

392
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:32,959
something that looks like we should

393
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,640
actually care the bad bad then we can

394
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,660
roll back the clock and say well what

395
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,579
has that person done

396
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,029
over the last 24 hours so what have they

397
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:44,969
done over the last three days so that

398
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:50,879
data is all wiped at the end of the show

399
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:54,449
it is a wipe not just a delete so so

400
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,610
yeah we we don't keep that we like our

401
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:58,889
privacy as well again we're not trying

402
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,689
to watch what you guys are doing it's

403
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,870
just more about finding people who are

404
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:08,039
coming after us and then taking care of

405
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:11,130
that then the malware sandboxing part

406
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,720
that's where Cisco comes in so we we had

407
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,400
some interesting information about

408
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,230
malware that was being passed over the

409
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,789
wire but we weren't sandboxing it and

410
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,829
seeing what it would do now we can do

411
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,929
that we see something interesting we can

412
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,520
pull the file out of the stream with net

413
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,650
witness throw it into threat grid

414
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,780
detonate it and actually interact with

415
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,610
it in like a glove box environment where

416
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,710
we can click on things and you know if

417
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,479
the malware wants us to like tell it

418
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,400
something we can we can actually do that

419
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,740
which is really nice and we've seen some

420
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,059
some cool malware strains because we

421
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,429
have that ability the endpoint side was

422
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,678
something where we were like okay

423
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:50,370
clearly you guys aren't gonna install

424
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,720
anything we give you that hey are you on

425
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,260
the blackhead Network install this

426
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,200
executable wouldn't go over well but we

427
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,270
do control the machines that we get for

428
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,669
registrations so those are rented by a

429
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,379
third party and we didn't like that it

430
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:07,830
was some who knows what happened those

431
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,840
machines prior so we provide a golden

432
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:13,439
image with the endpoint agents and stuff

433
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,500
on it they put that onto those laptops

434
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,240
which now we can monitor from the NOC so

435
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,940
we see anything that's happening on that

436
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,350
device that's not just registration we

437
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,059
kill it

438
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,000
there's a couple question marks there

439
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,350
I'll get into what that next piece was

440
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,360
and then we're also going to talk about

441
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,689
we wanted to do some automation what's

442
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,949
ways that we could take care of some

443
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,320
pass that we wanted to do but just

444
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,260
didn't have the bandwidth to do so I'll

445
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,570
talk about that so here's those question

446
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,090
marks if you stopped by the NOC you can

447
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,590
see this guy one of our Tier three

448
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,709
analysts

449
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,379
[Applause]

450
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,060
taking a look at after watch he's just

451
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,880
waiting right he's waiting and the

452
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,700
reason he's waiting is because starting

453
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,590
the us show this year we decided to put

454
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,510
some honey pots out onto the network to

455
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,490
see whether or not something was taking

456
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,490
place that we needed to be concerned

457
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:10,620
about more of a canary I guess really

458
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:15,510
than than a honey pot but that canary

459
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:19,540
lets us know in a very specific way that

460
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:22,540
somebody has poked the bear so that's

461
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,570
the escalation yeah so cookie monster

462
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,280
loses his freaking mind and we know okay

463
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,929
somebody's touched something that they

464
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,410
should they shouldn't even be in that

465
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:35,440
part of the network when it comes to

466
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,150
automation again there are things that

467
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,800
we wanted to do we'd see clear text

468
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,560
account credentials coming across the

469
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,860
wire so things you know FTP or email

470
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,480
accounts IMAP or pop 3 stuff and we're

471
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,909
like it would be nice to be able to like

472
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,590
inform people that this was taking place

473
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,630
but we just don't have the bandwidth to

474
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,520
do that we have in the past briefly

475
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,050
walking into classrooms yeah saying hey

476
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,629
there's an incredible ease being done

477
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,820
Rob but it was it was a very manual and

478
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,080
and obviously dilapidated process for

479
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,810
what we're trying to do and I'm getting

480
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,240
the evolution of where we've come so so

481
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,159
we didn't have with the amount of stuff

482
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,050
that we were saying going in and trying

483
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,400
to find someone especially through it's

484
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,139
easier to do in the trainings because we

485
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,700
know where that individual is they're in

486
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,760
this room right so we can go into the

487
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,440
room and say hey so-and-so you know can

488
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,550
we talk to whoever and then they could

489
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,020
we talked to you in the back and then

490
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,320
we're like oh man you're passing your

491
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,520
stuff or you're totally owned and then

492
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,200
they didn't believe us and we tell them

493
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,090
they're in there like ok yeah they're

494
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,160
like no no I'm fine I'm fine that's like

495
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,959
you know your your password is I love

496
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,790
kitties so indeed you have confirmed

497
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,350
malware so stuff where we saw it but

498
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,290
again we don't know who the user is

499
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,120
or we see crypto mining traffic these

500
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,000
are the notifications that now we're

501
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,939
sending using RSA has got an

502
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,280
orchestration piece that we have started

503
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,800
to use that allows us to send

504
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,149
essentially a pop-up like a captive

505
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,639
portal that says hey I see your stuff

506
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:05,349
right so in this case this is what it

507
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,758
looks like on a mobile device this is

508
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:10,029
what it would look like on you know on a

509
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,309
PC or laptop whatever here and it's just

510
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:13,690
saying at this point it said email which

511
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,700
were like oh because we were gonna email

512
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,559
it and then we decided to do a captive

513
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,619
portal so we edited that later in the

514
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:22,299
week but yeah and then they have to

515
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,859
basically click through it just says its

516
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:25,450
this is informational if you're aware

517
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,399
that there's crypto mining going on on

518
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,589
your machine then carry on like that's

519
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:33,728
the best use of your you know employers

520
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,839
resources I can think of and so they

521
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,460
just say okay great

522
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,408
but then they can reach out to us and

523
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,179
say can you give us more data we pull

524
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,399
you know packet captures and screenshots

525
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,169
and stuff and then send it back in an

526
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:47,709
email and say here's here's what we were

527
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:49,509
looking at so the automation and

528
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,129
basically collaboration of all that so

529
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:54,159
so net witness gives us that information

530
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,259
when we see that so if we see clear text

531
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,889
passwords or we see the crypto mining or

532
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:01,839
we see the malware see - traffic that we

533
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:03,399
can confirm this is where the automation

534
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,928
and basically collaboration between

535
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:06,518
those partners comes in and what we've

536
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,019
been building for show after show after

537
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:12,999
show that is finally getting to the

538
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:14,289
point that it's it's very useful it's

539
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,029
basically getting to the point that we

540
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,489
want but again that that is continually

541
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:20,559
evolving and not necessarily and state

542
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:22,899
by any means so at this point basically

543
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,299
net witness provides that information

544
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:27,998
they've seen that and we send that

545
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,099
information over to Palo Alto who then

546
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:32,499
adds that user machine into a dynamic

547
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,599
user group that dynamic user group is

548
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:37,089
then put into a policy that provides

549
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,729
that captive portal you will see that

550
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,379
again click-through provides a cookie so

551
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:43,119
that you don't keep seeing that you can

552
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:45,248
clear that if you need but again that's

553
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,529
why you may or may not see it and then

554
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:49,629
basically we're trying to automate these

555
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,429
things to give you guys the information

556
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,738
that you need keep you safe because

557
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,479
again and I'm sure you know as security

558
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,999
practitioners we can do so much on our

559
00:22:55,479 --> 00:23:00,609
side but if you're not aware of what's

560
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:03,219
happening or even aware that your own

561
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:05,978
door or mining cryptocurrency for

562
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:08,259
somebody else in some random country

563
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,789
then we're trying to provide you that

564
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,899
information because again any other day

565
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,499
we're on the other side of the fence

566
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:15,189
just like you so we're we're just as

567
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:16,750
curious about those type

568
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,250
things as well we actually didn't say

569
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,050
that we didn't say what our day job all

570
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,170
right so I'm a full-time threat hunter

571
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:26,139
for RSA he works for Palo Alto it didn't

572
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,060
go down the way you think it did it's

573
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,500
the other way like we started working

574
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,639
with these teams in the NOC and they

575
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,410
were like we want to hang out with you

576
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,030
all year long because you guys are so

577
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,550
cool and we'll give you money to hang

578
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,730
out with you and so now we work there so

579
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:43,659
that's how cool we are

580
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,730
see ya after and bring your wallets so

581
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,800
so again this is this is going to be

582
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,570
ever-evolving the the samples that we

583
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,340
can get from net witness on those packet

584
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,929
captures are then forwarded over to

585
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,760
threat grid and everything's detonated

586
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,980
that way so we can see those samples see

587
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,900
the bad bad versus the good bad and any

588
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,750
other information here that basically we

589
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:05,190
can use we are actively trying to

590
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,900
automate as much as possible to add more

591
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,400
security and stability to both the

592
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,610
environment as well as just informative

593
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,410
to to the users so again huge deal and

594
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,060
we appreciate all the partners and the

595
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,460
teams that do this and it's it's

596
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,290
becoming a very well oiled machine at

597
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,640
this point but we'll we'll keep chugging

598
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,260
and there's certainly more to keep going

599
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,150
on that front that it really is like

600
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,920
it's a team effort like collaborating on

601
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,720
not only just what we what our

602
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,340
expectations are for the NOC which is

603
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,940
all these teams delivering information

604
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,290
and it's it's been great to watch the

605
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,660
relationships between those teams

606
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,460
develop as well so you know they're like

607
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,930
oh your product doesn't interface with

608
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,780
our product in this way but that would

609
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,210
be useful and then like by the time like

610
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,010
a you know another blackhat show rolls

611
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,080
around they're like hey we you know

612
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,000
added that feature so now we work better

613
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,710
with your gear so to see things like

614
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,810
that happen is pretty cool but that

615
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,610
collaboration all goes also goes just as

616
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,629
again we're all security practitioners

617
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:05,590
right so so we had an interesting issue

618
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:08,430
where there was a trainer who was they

619
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,110
were just like I can't VPN to anything

620
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:16,600
actually the initial statement was the

621
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:19,030
blackhat NOC is blanking me and so

622
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,209
building the book thought we were we

623
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,649
were blocking VPN you know access or

624
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,650
whatever outside of the network which

625
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,809
wasn't the case and what ended up I mean

626
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,129
we worked through

627
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,990
like troubleshooting as a team we're

628
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:33,969
like okay well what what is happening

629
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,840
there because if we were plugged in it

630
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,249
worked if we were the VPN would

631
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,678
establish you could ping there's DNS

632
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:42,580
resolution but large web pages wouldn't

633
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,980
load so it was one of the most

634
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,539
frustrating annoying things but to the

635
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,700
the collaboration of those teams long

636
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,919
story short consumer-grade VPNs if you

637
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,450
were on UDP and if anybody seen this

638
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,889
like private Internet access or anything

639
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,240
like that you couldn't load a web page

640
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:57,100
while you had your VPN established

641
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,480
change it to TCP so there are some

642
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,070
things that we added basically there's

643
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,379
more overhead from the tunneling to the

644
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,289
APS back so the overhead of the

645
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:07,360
tunneling there the overhead of your VPN

646
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:10,240
and then your normal packets basically

647
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,070
large packets were not being fragmented

648
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,960
across UDP so if you saw that problem

649
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,029
and you change your VPN to TCP and you

650
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,029
can then fragment you'll be good but to

651
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:20,649
that point of collaboration everybody in

652
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,600
the NOC was working together to work on

653
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:24,580
this I had nothing to necessarily do

654
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,080
with the configuration issue on any of

655
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,189
our sides if that's the case but it was

656
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,699
a problem that we need to do at least

657
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,619
dig down into and solve we had we went

658
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,360
full tech support full-blown full tech

659
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:35,769
support well yeah it was ridiculous

660
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,229
I usually went to the trainer's

661
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:40,389
classroom and like showed him how to

662
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,649
configure things so that I was like okay

663
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:42,939
you got to get this config file from

664
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:45,129
here we're gonna do it like full tech

665
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,090
support that's the level of service we

666
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:48,090
provide here at Lac

667
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,229
so I guess I guess we should start out

668
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,809
with a yeah it's a Bravo for sure so

669
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:02,850
you're gonna see some laughs yeah you

670
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:07,480
guys feast like seriously in past shows

671
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:09,009
we what we would see was one in three

672
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,509
emails was in the clear

673
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:15,490
this is here this is the US Asia figured

674
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:18,639
it out a little while ago 90% of their

675
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:24,220
traffic is encrypted but this yeah that

676
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:26,769
was hawawa doing it for you can see

677
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,679
black out USA 30 percent and secure

678
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:32,830
protocols but what we saw this show was

679
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,389
actually only 14 unique users we're

680
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,980
sending their account credentials for

681
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:38,080
email across the wire and the clear

682
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,629
again because of the automation piece we

683
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,720
let those 14 know so here's hoping for a

684
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:48,039
hundred percent next year

685
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,960
but I called arms em yeah I like like we

686
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,700
every show when we talked about this

687
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,649
stuff when we do this like debrief

688
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,809
we're like we'd love to see everything

689
00:27:53,649 --> 00:28:00,370
encrypted and we're almost there at

690
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:01,840
least four on the email side gdpr for

691
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,518
the wind so this is the interesting

692
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,220
thing because last year what did we say

693
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:11,320
it was mid 50s the 60% I want to say was

694
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:13,870
encrypted 55% encrypted last year so if

695
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,760
we can legislate accepting cookies and

696
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,768
that means that that much traffic is

697
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,389
encrypted whether it's through Gd P R or

698
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:22,000
whatever else we need to if you guys are

699
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:23,139
really just launching VPNs which I don't

700
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,519
know with what we just talked about if

701
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,570
that was necessarily the case but if

702
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,210
that's what it takes

703
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,070
we as security practitioners in this

704
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,750
room and this can't this conference

705
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,870
needs to be the ones that are protecting

706
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:37,330
ourselves before we can go back to our

707
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:41,559
Sox or NOx and to work and and protect

708
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:43,149
our environment there so we are various

709
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,039
product ear to our eyes to see it we

710
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:46,149
literally can't tell you that we were

711
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,769
sitting in that chair and didn't believe

712
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:50,320
the staff that he was giving us

713
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:52,960
literally I'm like is this correct are

714
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,820
you sure this is right yes but to that

715
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,409
point again if that's what it takes then

716
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,450
maybe that's what we should do but again

717
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:00,880
a call to arms to you guys as well let's

718
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,139
the closer to 100 we get will be happy

719
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,419
and again we're not man in the middling

720
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,500
anything so we wouldn't see it but

721
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,090
that's not our job

722
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,250
we're not here to intercept your traffic

723
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,019
and look at the funny videos although

724
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,750
we'd love to get those that is not the

725
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:15,460
point so if you encrypt everything Bravo

726
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:21,010
thank you we don't want to see it let it

727
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:23,559
go so this one was was interesting so

728
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,899
again so we are trying to protect the

729
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,879
network from attack or protect you guys

730
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:32,590
from attack in this particular case we

731
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,899
had to protect the outside Internet yeah

732
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,189
from inside blackhat and what was

733
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,689
happening was there was a training class

734
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,279
going on and I don't know if it was just

735
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,049
somebody learned to do something new or

736
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,690
whatever they got excited and we're like

737
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:45,549
let me fire this off at the Internet but

738
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,200
somebody was like actively trying to do

739
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,789
sequel injections outside of the

740
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,860
blackout Network right so I had to go

741
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,860
into a classroom and I was like

742
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:58,899
I'm grifter knock it off

743
00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:00,879
like yeah but yeah so so when we see

744
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,800
this happen again there's our level

745
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,690
three analyst tells us what room it's in

746
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,460
all the automation of seeing that yeah

747
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,920
so that legitimately is part of the

748
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,960
automation this is a you know a map of

749
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,210
the conference space and then Cookie

750
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,370
Monster shows up in whatever room is

751
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,140
having the particular issue so he's down

752
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,239
here cooking works the spot

753
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,770
yeah cookie marks the spot and then but

754
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,260
yeah so we went in so sometimes we're

755
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:27,450
here to protect us and sometimes we're

756
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,450
here to protect you guys from yourselves

757
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,950
outbound web show so this is an

758
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,889
interesting one that basically we saw a

759
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:39,010
web shell so so quick story and again

760
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,720
trying to tie in collaboration Palo Alto

761
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,310
saw some stuff that basically provided

762
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,860
they walked over and talked to the RSA

763
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,500
guys to dig in and that witness a bit

764
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,419
basically we saw somebody that had a web

765
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:53,440
show to a wordpress site that could have

766
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:55,870
been a lab it you know it's that's to

767
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,400
each their own but basically there was a

768
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:01,209
web show that there was interactions

769
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,310
there was 600 ish commands connecting

770
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,770
and receiving back and forth to that web

771
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,179
shell and this was out on the open

772
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,530
Internet so again whether somebody

773
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,880
learned something or that's been a while

774
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,500
and they just needed to get the updated

775
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,140
stats from their back door then that

776
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,480
could have been that as well so

777
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,900
interesting things all right you're

778
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,250
gonna this is super frustrating and

779
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,960
you're gonna hear me get a little upset

780
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,670
here for a minute so big fix are big

781
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,160
broken so this is not the first time

782
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,570
that we have seen this and again this is

783
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,340
something where we as security

784
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,889
practitioners need to be diligent and

785
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,659
this is why we show it not to call out a

786
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:39,760
company although that's about to happen

787
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,000
big fix if you all know what that is an

788
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,940
IBM product that basically they provide

789
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,490
endpoint monitoring for asset management

790
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,840
right well they phone home to their

791
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,580
servers and they provide the information

792
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,070
for that asset management

793
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:58,679
well apparently within bigfix there is

794
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:01,600
an option to do that unencrypted so

795
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,610
there's no recon that has to happen

796
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,320
because if you just start watching the

797
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,959
network you

798
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,030
see every version of every software

799
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,730
every piece of software on that machine

800
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,460
and have your full recon done on that

801
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,700
machine so the problem is that it's an

802
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,740
option to do that so if you have big fix

803
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,720
go back and double check first of all

804
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,730
and I will say I won't throw them to the

805
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,760
company under the bus that this was but

806
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:29,880
this was a security company who is using

807
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,550
big fix and their person their laptops

808
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,040
their corporate machines are phoning

809
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:38,909
home and providing every piece of

810
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:43,080
information in the clear on those

811
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:45,750
security companies laptops this

812
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,149
shouldn't be an option but again to the

813
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,570
extent that will call out IBM and bigfix

814
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,250
we also will call out you as security

815
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,830
practitioners that don't just believe

816
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,950
what you see or don't assume when you

817
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:01,230
are sending back all of the information

818
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,540
from your corporate machines that it's

819
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,960
encrypted Trust is one thing and we talk

820
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,889
about trust a lot in the types of

821
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,400
protocols and other things that we do

822
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,140
whether SSL TLS certificates etc do not

823
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,440
trust another company to protect you

824
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,850
you're there to protect your company

825
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,290
double-check it take a pee cap look at

826
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,449
some things and make sure that you're

827
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,180
not sending every piece of information

828
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:27,840
that a hacker would ever want about

829
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,000
those machines so yeah hopefully they're

830
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,949
listening because this should not even

831
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,280
be an option it should not be a feature

832
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,940
to send things unencrypted over the

833
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,610
interwebs

834
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:48,120
I checked it doesn't say fireEye on

835
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:51,120
there anywhere all right so this these

836
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,360
are so from angry to light this is our

837
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,350
yeah man you guys are is it man there's

838
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:01,139
a lot of adult content on this network

839
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,480
it's super weird every show like we

840
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,610
don't like I'm I don't know why I'm just

841
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,610
I'm always surprised by the amount of it

842
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:11,449
but I don't know why we're surprised

843
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,990
yeah so there is there is a direct

844
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,449
correlation between the time of day

845
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:23,049
and when the most adult activity happens

846
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:25,418
and that is lunch I cool I guess

847
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,450
usually you are there technically that's

848
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:30,699
true they're doing exactly that and then

849
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,949
and then also toward the end of the day

850
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:34,529
so about 4:30 it's like oh I don't want

851
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,388
to pay for whatever the hotels are

852
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:40,659
download some stuff for my

853
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:42,730
extracurriculars later all right

854
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,440
we give you even the top C's man yeah

855
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,060
though these butts showed another

856
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,830
appearance this year but it fell off the

857
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,929
list it fall off the list it did that

858
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:56,710
was really popular in the US so the the

859
00:34:52,929 --> 00:35:02,050
longest porn streaming session seventeen

860
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:10,840
point six seven minutes that they you

861
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:13,150
know that's okay keep trying great what

862
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,610
was it at the u.s. show it was like 15

863
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:19,090
minutes we did well he gave a round of

864
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:21,250
applause what was it well we're a

865
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:26,760
hundred and twenty-one that's right two

866
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:34,780
hours two hours get up that slide and

867
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:38,050
then the shortest 18 second white chat

868
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,060
it wasn't glowing white didn't have the

869
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,800
us show was the sites that they went to

870
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,230
we didn't put that up there but then

871
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,940
like it was I think was 11 seconds was

872
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,670
the shortest session in the US show and

873
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:52,570
I was like what's that link because I it

874
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:56,859
must be amazing so we we figured we'd

875
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:58,450
share so you get weird like yeah we like

876
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:03,069
to keep it weird wait wait wait you

877
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:04,600
didn't what oh all right so so what we

878
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,520
had to run the numbers and crunch it a

879
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,680
bit so this is the longest that's the

880
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,080
shortest but overall all of the adult

881
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:15,118
sessions that took place over the course

882
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:21,220
of blackhat we have the MTT Oh anybody

883
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:26,500
mean time to orgasm right so so yeah so

884
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:30,259
that is 42 seconds solid work

885
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:33,110
so we will leave you on that that light

886
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:44,330
note and just start at asking us

887
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:45,740
questions what do you got there's got to

888
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:54,350
be questions after that that would start

889
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:56,660
going go ahead randomizing MAC addresses

890
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,520
whenever they connect mm-hmm what do you

891
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,089
think or how do how does that impact

892
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,400
your stuff stats I mean as stats go and

893
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,840
I as far as stats go that certainly will

894
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,460
if you're randomizing a Mac every time

895
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,630
that we will see it is a unique device

896
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,610
if you're connecting and reconnecting

897
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,280
over and over and over so I mean as far

898
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:15,020
as that goes it may be skewed but it

899
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,670
we're not doing it just by Mac we're

900
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:21,500
Dennis go I saw him up here alright just

901
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,650
by Mac we're not doing just Mac and you

902
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:28,160
can tell us device is its huh Mac and

903
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:30,530
hostname so in that that makes you my my

904
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:36,100
throw the numbers off but but mostly

905
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:38,210
just on the unique devices so yeah good

906
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,410
thanks I can't be the only one in here

907
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:46,310
no way oh there you go right there

908
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:47,750
did the honey pick up anything no so a

909
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,299
few things and that's an interesting

910
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,950
piece that which I mean honestly I don't

911
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,820
dare people we're not pushing anything

912
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:57,560
but but it will leave it alone you don't

913
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,630
go look we did not at this show there's

914
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,270
only a few hits in the US show and

915
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,890
that's again some evolution we won't dig

916
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,940
into too far what we're trying to do and

917
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,310
kind of where that goes obvious that

918
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,220
gives away some of the surprise but no

919
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,170
there were no hits here and I'm we're

920
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,910
curious or curious if other people are

921
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,750
curious and not digging in if that's the

922
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,830
case or if you're just being

923
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,480
professional because you're a black out

924
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,100
your company paid but again we're

925
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,200
certainly ok with that that's our job is

926
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:25,670
to provide stable secure network that's

927
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,060
the case didn't so be it no we're here

928
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,060
over there

929
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,250
- obviously you do a lot of stuff

930
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,629
internally on the network do you do sort

931
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,360
of any monitoring of things coming from

932
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:42,420
external to internal that wasn't kind of

933
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,720
triggered by anything internally so we

934
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,090
actually I won't begin too far we do not

935
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,700
allow basically anything in powell view

936
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,350
obviously is the that LAN gateway that

937
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,540
they're seeing anything their logs and

938
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,160
we have information around that for the

939
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,600
most part everything seems like standard

940
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,009
just something hanging out on the

941
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,080
internet you're just getting scanned and

942
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,200
banged up that way Powell obviously does

943
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,370
a great job of securing that and making

944
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,439
sure that there's no issues but they're

945
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,730
certain that we we don't we don't allow

946
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:19,770
anything that's not an established

947
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:23,360
session so cup that's you yeah have you

948
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:27,990
gotten any legal actions from an over

949
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:29,610
excited person from blackhat but so

950
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,580
expand on that and then when you say

951
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:37,500
legalizing from I mean if if if there

952
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:42,750
was some SQL injection done on some

953
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:45,600
external website have it go yeah so so

954
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,130
is there any legal action or I think

955
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,630
some people will also ask that question

956
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,690
and have the police ever gotten involved

957
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,820
or those type of things like so no no

958
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,710
legal action outside of what normally

959
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,690
like law enforcement would take care of

960
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:00,060
we have had in the past that not at this

961
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:05,490
show but other blackhat shows the u.s.

962
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:06,840
in particular and people from the show

963
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,359
we're doing things outside of our

964
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,860
network on hotel networks etc that

965
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,320
certainly police were involved but

966
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:17,610
obviously that or or in some cases you

967
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:20,220
know people were planning a attacks or

968
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:23,070
screwing around and trolling folks that

969
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,919
were in the casino area but planning

970
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,080
those things out in the clear on the

971
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,440
black hat network / IRC and that kind of

972
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,509
thing

973
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,420
where we let the security team know that

974
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,000
that you know hey somebody's had an over

975
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,200
the Luxor to mess with your stuff

976
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,329
because we have those relationships with

977
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,040
them the closest we ever got to so we we

978
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:45,990
have like you know the like it's like

979
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,609
what we can call we have a relationship

980
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,160
with the FBI so we could say hey like

981
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,740
there's an issue the closest we ever got

982
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,868
was this year at the us like we

983
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,930
legitimately thought somebody was like

984
00:40:53,869 --> 00:41:00,210
physically in danger and in the end like

985
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:03,509
we were like after after a bunch of

986
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,710
investigation it wasn't the case and the

987
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:10,770
guy probably would have deserved it

988
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:15,180
anyway so somebody else I'm here right

989
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:16,680
over there so my question was um kind of

990
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,750
already Alton but I'm just gonna ask

991
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,549
well let's do it again then it's the

992
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:25,880
most interesting babe instant response

993
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:28,109
events do like that and most interesting

994
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,089
as far as incident I wouldn't say that

995
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:33,598
we really do incident response outside

996
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:35,339
of again because incident response would

997
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,079
be deemed something completely different

998
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,849
outside of this environment so as far as

999
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,250
that goes the most interesting stuff is

1000
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:44,220
walking into a room and saying y'all are

1001
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:47,010
being dumb stop it or or the like you

1002
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,020
know if the let's hear one analyst type

1003
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,460
crap where you're right you are cc2

1004
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,829
coming from your machine like this

1005
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,040
that's not it's not that interesting

1006
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:58,200
because we don't see full-scale attacks

1007
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,150
like on this network there's no like

1008
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,270
it's not like oh the blackhat networks

1009
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,970
under attack from a PT's or like it's

1010
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:09,509
it's yeah well we what we do try to do

1011
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:11,520
is because the users do come infected or

1012
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,500
they are you know transmitting stuff in

1013
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,020
the clear it's just more about hoping

1014
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,790
that they we can provide feedback enough

1015
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,369
to where they leave black have actually

1016
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,660
more secure than when they came versus

1017
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,369
what most people think about the

1018
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,710
blackout network which is like gotta get

1019
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:27,750
a burner laptop and a burner phone and I

1020
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,880
got a like you know cut all ties with my

1021
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:33,239
family

1022
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,829
like that that kind of stuff we're

1023
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,349
actually trying to make it like the

1024
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:39,479
opposite like we're gonna change that

1025
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:55,979
stigma if you will and be yea willing to

1026
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:58,319
use it anybody else so showing the

1027
00:42:55,979 --> 00:43:00,538
partners you're saying if we can add any

1028
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,569
product to the black hat Network even if

1029
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:03,869
it doesn't exist what would it be oh

1030
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:09,959
snap

1031
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:12,059
these VC come with a good idea for the

1032
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:14,160
next so so I mean as far as you know

1033
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,829
your game so as far as that goes I would

1034
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,969
say that there's a few things that we're

1035
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:19,859
trying to get that we've played with

1036
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:22,019
some other things and we've added the

1037
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:24,328
way that we work with partners I guess

1038
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:26,098
to that extent that at the us show for

1039
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:28,289
example eka how if you've ever heard of

1040
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,910
Becca how brought their wireless

1041
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:31,499
spectrum analysis that they have some of

1042
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:35,239
the really cool tools to do that and

1043
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:39,419
basically help do RF scanning etc to

1044
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,680
verify that our air spaces is clean if

1045
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,479
you will so that we don't run any issues

1046
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,589
that way so there's some some things

1047
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:45,269
that way that we've worked with other

1048
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:47,038
tools I think as far as our core

1049
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:49,348
infrastructure and the main stuff that

1050
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,969
we have where I feel like we're pretty

1051
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:53,339
set right now and again we're getting

1052
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:54,359
kind of set in that stride and feel

1053
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,308
comfortable with where we're at but

1054
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,109
there's always different tools that that

1055
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:59,729
we'd love to use that may give us more

1056
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:01,199
insight more information and play with

1057
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:02,759
but I can't really say that there's

1058
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,259
anything specific that we're looking for

1059
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:05,789
but if there's something out there and

1060
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:06,959
somebody wants to you know see what it

1061
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:09,440
would look like there were certainly

1062
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:11,489
open to talk like how worked with

1063
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,019
absolutely yeah like we and we have

1064
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:14,910
brought stuff in that we had then

1065
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,410
haven't decided it's not what we thought

1066
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,078
it would be we've tried some different

1067
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,890
things around Wireless doing some

1068
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,150
triangulation for other things but I

1069
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,859
didn't seem to be as big of an issue so

1070
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,989
that again it's more around tools and

1071
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:27,150
just visualization and what can make our

1072
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:28,529
job easier if you will some automation

1073
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,449
platforms again with the evolution of

1074
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:31,769
things that we're getting to but again

1075
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:32,789
for the most part I wouldn't say that

1076
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,738
there's anything that we're necessarily

1077
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:36,719
searching for yet but but we're always

1078
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,999
open to looking at different things that

1079
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,650
may open our eyes a bit more all right

1080
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:41,339
well we don't want to keep you guys from

1081
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:47,970
your last

1082
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:49,650
Oh quick ahead so the that is the net

1083
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,450
witness plat what platforms are we using

1084
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,560
first seminal are you like an RSA plant

1085
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,689
or something he's like what are you

1086
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,820
thing for your you know your seem and

1087
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,130
your orchestration it's the net witness

1088
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,480
platform and then like where the RSA

1089
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,980
guys over here you can pay this guy when

1090
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,290
you're done

1091
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,610
so yeah that's what that's what we're

1092
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,610
using thanks so much guys
