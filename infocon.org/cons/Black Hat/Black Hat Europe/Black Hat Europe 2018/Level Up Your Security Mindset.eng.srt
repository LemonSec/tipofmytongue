1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,309
hello is my voice cut there we go hello

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:12,300
how's everybody doing today last talk of

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,379
the day I end up telling people like

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,389
when I talk to people about doing

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,340
presentations and stuff end up giving

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,050
them good advice and then I never follow

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,359
it myself and one of the best things you

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,310
can do is use a light background with

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,050
dark text so I'm going to warn you that

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,720
everything I have is a dark background

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,880
with light text instead so this screen

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,470
will constantly be washed out it was on

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,040
purpose just so I could break my own

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,440
rules so here we go let's get this thing

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,290
started so this has level up your

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,360
security mindset my name is Nathan

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,019
Hamill I am the head of cyber security

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,070
research for Caddell Sukie security some

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,440
of my colleagues are here you may have

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,300
seen JP talk earlier today I do quite a

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,579
bit of public speaking on various

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,739
security topics most of them are more on

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,260
the offensive side so this is a little

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,328
new for me to talk about something that

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
I kind of have conversations with other

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,369
security people about that our problems

27
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,280
yet we don't seem to be addressing too

28
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,490
well I'm also on the blackhat review

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,479
board so for this conference in for

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,220
blackhat USA

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,990
if you've ever submitted a talk it's

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,640
possible that I looked at it if it got

33
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,320
accepted it was because of me if it got

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,369
rejected it was because of somebody else

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,979
so just keep that in mind so enough

36
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,650
about me I'd like to thank everybody for

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,810
coming to this talk and I know it's

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,369
strange gotta thank everybody before the

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,740
talk even starts because you might walk

40
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,820
out of here saying that was terrible and

41
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,860
some people might but it's hard it's it

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,898
can be a hard sell to come to a security

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,570
conference and listen to somebody talk

44
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,960
more about mindset and less about you

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,389
know attacks or you know new new

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,949
technologies so thank you very much and

47
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:02,549
on that threat of optimism you know

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,619
there won't be any demos no days no

49
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,479
fireworks explosions or fires and I

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,129
promise that's the last time I use those

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,870
transitions it's just I'm using keynote

52
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:16,220
and

53
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,680
I never get to use those so in in our

54
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,569
lines of work these are the things that

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,819
we focus on a lot because these are the

56
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,890
fun parts of security focusing on Oh

57
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,619
days and new tools and new techniques

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,690
and stories that people come up with

59
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,819
that they did a hundred million

60
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,440
different ways and they were able to

61
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,079
gain access to some piece of sensitive

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,730
data but when we go back to work Monday

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,140
morning the thing that really eats us

64
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,480
alive are things that are simple from an

65
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,220
attack perspective but complex from a

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,380
protection perspective so things like

67
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,049
password reuse and password resets and

68
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,790
things like that so we have no shortage

69
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:58,280
of problems in our industry so I decided

70
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,540
to take a few of these things and carve

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,760
them up into a couple of different

72
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:06,679
sections so for each of these I'm going

73
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,399
to try to sprinkle in some things that I

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,230
think are recommendations for that some

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,299
of them all summarized at the end a

76
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,190
couple of the spots will get a little

77
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:17,870
bit ranty I'll try not to do that I have

78
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,120
a tendency tendency to go off on a

79
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,530
tangent so there's a nice lady up front

80
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,510
who's gonna hold cards up and let me

81
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,350
know that I need to speed it up I also

82
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,910
stay highly caffeinated when I travel so

83
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,608
if I start to really speed up you'll

84
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,840
know I need to use the restroom so where

85
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:38,109
are we at today so we have this view of

86
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,060
security that is kind of like a buffet

87
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,530
so we go down the line and we look at

88
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,370
all these different things and we say

89
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,980
hey firewall and hey antivirus and ooh

90
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,660
ADR I'll take one of those and we take

91
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,880
all of these different solutions because

92
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,910
it's seen that we have to have those so

93
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,430
if something bad happens and we get

94
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,769
owned we can say at least I took the

95
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,870
orange chicken so every single one of

96
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,269
these things we end up evaluating with

97
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,370
different criteria based not necessarily

98
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,230
on the effectiveness of it but just

99
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,769
having it in general and that causes us

100
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,569
a lot of problems I don't think I need

101
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,280
to tell the people in this room that

102
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,680
security is often an afterthought and

103
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,070
the products that we buy and the things

104
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,940
that we put inside of our organization's

105
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,450
we get left out of a lot of

106
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,240
conversations

107
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,219
important conversations because and many

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,470
organizations people see security as a

109
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,560
roadblock or we're difficult to deal

110
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,570
with if you've worked in the field for

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,220
quite a period of time you'll know that

112
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,230
even some of your peers are difficult to

113
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,820
deal with so if we have difficulty

114
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,290
dealing with each other then it's not a

115
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,700
far stretch to think that the people we

116
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,140
work with would also think that we're

117
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,270
difficult we tend to focus on

118
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,490
unrealistic threats unrealistic risks

119
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,130
things that may or may not happen in

120
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,100
possible scenarios because we feel

121
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,260
that's our job and the other thing is is

122
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,910
we're kind of rigid inflexible when

123
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,920
people bring us things that they want to

124
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,660
do we tell them we should they shouldn't

125
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,180
do that because the entire company could

126
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,240
go out of business so where do we need

127
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,730
to be we need to have security

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,400
engineered into the solutions that we

129
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,170
purchase or the things that we build if

130
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,580
we are part of a product company we want

131
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,880
to make sure that we're engineering

132
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,050
security and on top of that we need to

133
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,110
make sure that we have security by

134
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,940
default because additional security

135
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,800
steps that people have to take that they

136
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,290
don't know about or are complex to

137
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,420
configure they won't do it so quite

138
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,300
often the initial state is kind of how

139
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,670
it stays we need to be collaborating

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,680
with other business units we need to be

141
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,630
more focused on real risks and real

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,340
threats and we need to be agile and

143
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,340
flexible something we don't typically do

144
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,739
and one of the big things we need to do

145
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,429
or think about is the fact that all of

146
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,890
these problems security by default you

147
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,380
know engineer security into products

148
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,750
aren't technical challenges they're

149
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,310
social and political challenges so we

150
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,940
have the technology to solve these

151
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,820
problems

152
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,530
it's the adoption the engineering the

153
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,659
ease-of-use all of those things are what

154
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,880
causes us problems and that's what this

155
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,180
talk is about because there's really too

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,909
much at stake and I think when we think

157
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,780
of technology being dangerous to us we

158
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,630
think of Skynet and robots that want to

159
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,780
wipe out humanity but we don't need a

160
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,810
Skynet level event for the technology we

161
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,349
use on a daily basis to be dangerous to

162
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,990
us we already have surgical robots

163
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,910
and medical implants and autonomous cars

164
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,660
and drones and these things are only

165
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,250
going to increase in size and we need to

166
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,680
be part of the conversation making that

167
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,800
better whether it's in our organization

168
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,180
or whether it's external to us

169
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,850
and there's no shortage of things

170
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,010
actually working against us so some of

171
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,200
this talk is about us not doing the

172
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,750
right things or how we can change as

173
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,280
security professionals but we also have

174
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,970
things that are working against us as

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,679
well and I will try to cover that

176
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,500
because our jobs will only get harder

177
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,480
the size and scope of what we do will

178
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,180
get more difficult and the size and

179
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,500
scope of the data we collect and have to

180
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,500
protect we'll get will get much more

181
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,320
large so let's kick off the first

182
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,440
section of perspective and probably what

183
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,500
you're thinking is can't I just hack the

184
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,800
planet better if only it were that easy

185
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,770
then we would all be doing it so as

186
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,260
security professionals quite often we

187
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,349
run into some challenges where we kind

188
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,950
of fight against ourselves so when we do

189
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,670
a report or the output of our

190
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,469
assessments and the various activities

191
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,270
that we take quite often our

192
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,040
recommendations are unrealistic because

193
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,200
we haven't considered all the

194
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,300
implementation problems all of the

195
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,010
things that developers or the product

196
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,050
teams have to deal with our findings are

197
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,820
complicated we don't think about

198
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,050
end-users and how they consume our

199
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:15,090
output and in general we're difficult to

200
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,460
deal with that's also a theme too by the

201
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:21,630
way you'll see we mention that and when

202
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:24,840
people don't understand us right we like

203
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,969
to say they're idiots or they're just

204
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,270
too lazy to put in the work which just

205
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,400
which isn't the case so we have a lack

206
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,199
of empathy and the people we deal with

207
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,598
as well like we don't really understand

208
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,120
their situation we're just why can't

209
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,960
they understand we're only trying to

210
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,839
protect them from being owned and it can

211
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,850
be fun to think about a world run by

212
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,500
security professionals until you start

213
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,100
digging into the implementation of

214
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,310
that so if you think about it everybody

215
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,480
would run Linux of course with some

216
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,930
kernel that they compiled themselves

217
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,850
with only specific flags all software

218
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,229
would be open-source and of course

219
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,790
audited by yourself because you have

220
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,250
nothing but time to just sit down and

221
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,079
audit all this and why would we need

222
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,480
gooeys because everything is just a

223
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,670
command line tool waiting to be used and

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,250
what we don't really think about is that

225
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,400
security in most organizations unless

226
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,280
you're a security company isn't profit

227
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,949
center it's a cost center so that means

228
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,870
we need other business units to make

229
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:32,340
money for the company so that we can

230
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:36,330
continue to do our jobs if you've seen

231
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:39,300
any of Alex Stamos's talks over the past

232
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:43,020
couple of years he talks about security

233
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,540
nihilism so this fact that if if your

234
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,430
system isn't super secure against some

235
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,810
unrealistic attack then it shouldn't

236
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,910
exist

237
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,410
you know why put any solution in place

238
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,990
the users are just gonna make the wrong

239
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,150
decision anyway or why even do our jobs

240
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,450
because if the NSA wants access to the

241
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,459
data is they're going to have access to

242
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,190
the data but the fact of the matter is

243
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:09,270
is making things more difficult for

244
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,630
attackers has value if it costs somebody

245
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:15,510
money to send spam then it becomes an

246
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,790
ROI problem if we if we force attackers

247
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,460
to burn an o day to gain access to some

248
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,250
data there's value in that and I think

249
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,610
that this balancing of risk is something

250
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,020
that we need to take into account

251
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,390
another thing that we need to do is

252
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,910
think about our mission what are we

253
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,790
trying to accomplish in our security

254
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:39,390
teams and in our security community you

255
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:42,120
know our mission needs to align with the

256
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,710
people we serve so we need to align our

257
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,360
mission with the business units we need

258
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,460
to align our mission with the larger

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,560
community and we need to align our

260
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:54,000
mission with ourselves which can be

261
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,010
quite difficult let's talk about offense

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,770
because that's where we like to spend a

263
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,200
lot of our time we're here at a security

264
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,750
confident conference where a lot of

265
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,090
offensive things are being talked about

266
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,060
and this is the cool part of security

267
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,310
right we love a good story somebody says

268
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,410
hey I compromised these ten systems I

269
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,630
pivoted a bunch of different times and I

270
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,089
gained access to some sensitive data we

271
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,830
put a lot of emphasis on Oh days in

272
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,600
difficult scenarios and all of these

273
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,790
different things but they don't

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,520
necessarily and that stuff's important

275
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,969
right but they don't necessarily help us

276
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,060
on a daily basis so a thing to take away

277
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,830
is protecting an organization isn't a

278
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,410
matter of having better offensive

279
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,180
capabilities an entire stack of

280
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,079
vulnerabilities and bugs doesn't

281
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,120
necessarily make you more secure success

282
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,850
in a security program isn't measured

283
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,000
that way and I think we like the

284
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,990
offensive side of security because it's

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,840
much more of a technical problem and

286
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,300
it's very easy to measure right how many

287
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,080
bugs did you find how much time did you

288
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:08,550
spend you know what severity were they

289
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,680
very easy on the defensive side I think

290
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,829
we don't often think about the defenders

291
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,050
of the systems we're testing so we like

292
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,180
to applaud ourselves and pat ourselves

293
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,160
on the back whenever we compromise

294
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,410
something or look look how look how

295
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,630
stupid this system was configured these

296
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,939
guys can't secure anything but the fact

297
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,189
of the matter is is the people that

298
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,140
we're testing against so when we play

299
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,460
the offensive side of security and

300
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,590
somebody else is playing the defender

301
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,900
the defender is rarely set up for

302
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:40,140
success because they are measured quite

303
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,209
differently it's not as clean as the

304
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,220
technical side so how do you measure

305
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:48,990
defense right did nothing happen did you

306
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,430
stay within budget what is your budget

307
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,880
how much money did you spend this

308
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,859
quarter

309
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,310
it's a completely different set of

310
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,290
problems so you know offense is a

311
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,300
technical problem and defense is a

312
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,969
social and political problem and this is

313
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,920
a theme that probably runs through many

314
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,360
different keynote presentations at

315
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,670
security conferences that we just

316
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,380
haven't been able to digest in speaking

317
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,099
of these keynotes at these conferences

318
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,720
throughout the past couple of years

319
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
you'll see people stand up and they'll

320
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,880
say

321
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
who are the defenders in the room and

322
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,870
people raise their hands and everybody

323
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,220
claps their hands and everybody walks

324
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,580
out of the room when they're done saying

325
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,730
I'm glad I don't have that job mainly

326
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,110
because of the social and political

327
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:36,540
issues that they deal with as defenders

328
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:39,350
so understanding the defenders viewpoint

329
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,810
we have to understand that our solutions

330
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:46,560
can't be perfect we have to be ok with

331
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:49,650
imperfect solutions because better is

332
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,089
still better we may not be able to have

333
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:56,520
best but there's value in better and I

334
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,440
know what you're thinking so I know what

335
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,350
he's getting at he's getting at risk

336
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,530
reduction yes that's exactly what I'm

337
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,620
talking about and if we think about real

338
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,870
risk our job as security people is to

339
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,790
understand risk but we don't always take

340
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,840
in all the factors I believe in my

341
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,550
abstract for this talk I said that we

342
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,800
focus on a lot of worst-case scenarios

343
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,990
and I think we don't do it to be

344
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,839
malicious we just feel it's our job to

345
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,750
handle the worst-case scenarios and I

346
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,240
like to measure this in what I call the

347
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,680
burner phone at Def Con so before I go

348
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,670
into this does anybody bring a burner

349
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,260
phone to Def Con ok how many people are

350
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,599
lying about it put your hands up okay

351
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,220
just checking

352
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,720
so the burner phone at Def Con is

353
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,270
something I see a lot of people doing

354
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,920
and I tried to get them to quantify the

355
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,510
risk of doing that look what they're

356
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,550
trying to accomplish because they've

357
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,520
basically taken they're fully patched

358
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:56,430
and fully updated iOS device and grabbed

359
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,199
a very inexpensive Android device that's

360
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,260
running about three versions behind and

361
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,810
has probably never seen a patch so to me

362
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,810
that's not a good risk trade-off I would

363
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,939
just lower my profile and hope for the

364
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:13,319
best because not everybody in the world

365
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,000
is out to attack you personally I kind

366
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,710
of use that as my way of determining

367
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,720
risk and when I try to explain it to

368
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,520
people some people still tell me I'm an

369
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,870
idiot and my credentials and everything

370
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,380
are probably still out there and they

371
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:29,070
could be right but our relationship with

372
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,670
risk needs to change we can't go on this

373
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,460
tangent

374
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,579
of risk elimination all the time because

375
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:39,090
taking risks is necessary to be

376
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:42,240
successful and if you talk to developers

377
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:45,150
and product teams they take risks every

378
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,270
day and many of them are very successful

379
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:52,910
so I think that we need to take more

380
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:56,069
risks and add more innovation thinking

381
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,199
to our security programs and if we do it

382
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,630
right if we have the balance of what we

383
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,720
need to do then the people we serve will

384
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,760
see us as being more flexible and that

385
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,700
also means change which is another thing

386
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,290
that scares security people and once

387
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,080
again I don't think this comes from a

388
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,480
bad place right this really comes from

389
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,580
the fact that change introduces risk and

390
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:23,150
we feel that it's our job to eliminate

391
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:27,480
risk for a better part of my career I

392
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,670
was a consultant so I really liked the

393
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,500
perspective of being a consultant I got

394
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,420
to see how many different organizations

395
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,760
did things many different verticals

396
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,390
financial manufacturing and it really

397
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,020
gave me a good overview of what to do in

398
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,260
an even better view of what not to do

399
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:48,120
and one of the parts of doing this that

400
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,330
I heard one of the biggest excuses I've

401
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,420
heard is that won't work here so I

402
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,850
understand that's good some companies do

403
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,979
that but that won't work here and I

404
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,860
think that won't work here is an excuse

405
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,110
we use too much because how do we know

406
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,329
it won't work here I mean perspectives

407
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,270
change people change management changes

408
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:12,929
people get other jobs and move on it's

409
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:15,150
our job to convince people when there's

410
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,190
something valuable if it's a really

411
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,600
valuable thing we should be doing and I

412
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,240
realize I'm talking in abstract terms

413
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:26,520
here then it's our job to convince the

414
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:29,000
people that need to change to change so

415
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,139
we really need a perspective shift to

416
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,930
handle some of these issues and there's

417
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,520
this this section was a little ranty so

418
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,740
there's not a lot of takeaways other

419
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,420
than don't do that which is one of my

420
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,680
other rules that I always say you know

421
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,750
never should just say don't do that

422
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,590
because that's not a valid solution for

423
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,460
anything but

424
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,830
don't do that so we should be more of a

425
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,539
change agent focus on risk reduction

426
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,129
instead of elimination and increase

427
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,360
empathy and understanding which is

428
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,610
another topic of this talk so let's talk

429
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,600
about the fun part of security the

430
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:06,629
social aspect the future of security is

431
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,270
a social and political challenge not a

432
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:14,250
technical challenge which means we have

433
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:16,350
to increase our communication increase

434
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,750
our ability to empathize with the people

435
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:22,529
we're trying to change and be a part of

436
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:25,140
the larger conversation you know our our

437
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,330
mission needs to involve other people

438
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,419
and once again I know what you're

439
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:33,750
thinking we have to talk to people and

440
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,490
that is true we can't continue to tell

441
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,029
people that their problems aren't as

442
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,980
important as ours or if they did this

443
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:42,740
one thing then the entire company would

444
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,409
collapse

445
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,690
overall we just can't be difficult and

446
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:52,020
soft skills aren't optional anymore if

447
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,740
they ever were because we all know even

448
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,440
if you're a genius

449
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,179
if everybody hates your guts nobody's

450
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,110
gonna want to work with you you could be

451
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,399
the best X person in the world but if

452
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,289
you're difficult people would rather

453
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:07,709
work with people that they get along

454
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:09,390
with and that they like the the big

455
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,490
topic here is that you can't be

456
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,899
successful by yourself regardless of

457
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:20,789
your job position and that means we need

458
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:23,129
to think about this word know is the

459
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:25,679
default reaction that we get many times

460
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,799
when we're asked something and know can

461
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,220
be intoxicating right it feels good to

462
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,529
say at first and it feels good to say

463
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,110
from our perspective because we feel

464
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:40,409
that we're saying no from a place of

465
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:45,539
good intent so that kind of gives us an

466
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:47,669
excuse to say it but no is easy it's yes

467
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,029
that's hard it's yes that's a challenge

468
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:53,159
right so too many people that I talk to

469
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:55,049
that's why they got into security in the

470
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,420
first place is because of the challenge

471
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:01,050
it's a challenging job is very reward

472
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,900
job so yes is what we should be telling

473
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:08,000
people and we've kind of become a

474
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:11,430
roadblock at many organizations and

475
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,950
that's kind of sad because we all know

476
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,760
what happens when people don't like

477
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:20,670
doing something they don't do it

478
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,290
we're also slowing down the pace of

479
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,080
business when we say no or when we

480
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:28,110
become a roadblock and we don't set

481
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,710
other people up for success we kind of

482
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,419
have this us-versus-them mentality which

483
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,460
is funny because we all work at the same

484
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,550
company we're not in competition with

485
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,780
each other we're in competition to be

486
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:44,610
successful and I think we often feel to

487
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,990
that we are the smartest people in the

488
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,570
room like people can't possibly

489
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:51,780
understand what we go through we do this

490
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,909
and this and when in actuality it's the

491
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,490
other way around and we do make some

492
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:00,210
excuses for this and here are some terms

493
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,370
that you probably heard peb CAC does

494
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,480
everybody know what peb CAC means

495
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,090
problem exists between keyboard and

496
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,740
chair there's no patch for human

497
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,649
stupidity that's another one that I've

498
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,060
heard throughout the years you know

499
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,980
there's no cloud some just someone

500
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:18,179
else's computer this one still amazes me

501
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,460
in 2018 that I run into security people

502
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,110
who are anti cloud but they're not anti

503
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,330
cloud because of some technical

504
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,760
constraint or some privacy consideration

505
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,199
most of the time they do have this

506
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,879
attitude that it's somebody else's

507
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,440
computer and I'm like yes somebody

508
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,300
else's computer were they some other

509
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,950
company that has a vested interest in

510
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,570
your success and has a team of people

511
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,900
doing all this stuff that you don't want

512
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,490
to do great if you've ever ran your if

513
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,140
you've ever ran your own WordPress

514
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,640
implementation or your own mail server

515
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,210
you'll know what I'm talking about

516
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,010
however if you if you ever do want to

517
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,920
get into a situation where you want to

518
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,660
store your files and some random

519
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,900
strangers computer well there's a

520
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,570
blockchain for that so file coin will

521
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:05,450
allow you to store your files on some

522
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,450
random strangers computer cool

523
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:13,350
I like this picture because I've ran

524
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,360
into this situation before I've always

525
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:19,439
tried to be helpful even when it wasn't

526
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,939
my job to be helpful and I ran into

527
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,070
somebody before that couldn't figure out

528
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,260
why their computer wasn't turning on and

529
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,980
this was the problem and although it's

530
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,379
funny to look back on and it's funny to

531
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,540
think about it becomes very scary when

532
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,700
you realize that that person is on the

533
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,110
frontlines of protecting your

534
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,370
organization and then it becomes scary

535
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:46,500
because you can't be everywhere at once

536
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,750
if your security program requires you to

537
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,360
be everywhere at once then I can

538
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,040
guarantee you that it will fail and by

539
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,770
you I don't mean you personally I mean

540
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:01,020
you as in your security team we need the

541
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,490
users around us we need the teams around

542
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,650
us we need the groups around us to be an

543
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,940
extension of our security team and I'm

544
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,710
not just talking about security

545
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,330
champions right because security

546
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,430
champions are people we specifically

547
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,460
armed with knowledge that help us

548
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:17,160
perform a security function I'm talking

549
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,130
about the regular people that work at

550
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,260
our organizations you know are they

551
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,620
going to resist some you know nation

552
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,330
state level attack of course not but the

553
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,000
more people we have armed with basic

554
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,159
security knowledge the better because

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,130
the big secret is is people find

556
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,230
interesting ways to not do things they

557
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,910
don't want to do and if I were any good

558
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,680
at google image search I would have

559
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,020
found this image but many of you have

560
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,340
probably seen the image of this gate at

561
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,800
an apartment complex and there's no

562
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,240
fence around it and there's footprints

563
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,919
in the snow just walking around the gate

564
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,030
because people were too lazy to open the

565
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:57,590
gate and why would you open the gate

566
00:23:51,030 --> 00:24:00,120
there's no fence I think where our

567
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,570
problems stem from a lot of our problems

568
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,449
stem from is from our goals so our goals

569
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:10,379
are not aligned with the business units

570
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:13,650
many times so if if the development

571
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,080
team's goal is to move fast and our goal

572
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,520
is to move slow then you can see how we

573
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,570
will never be on the same page and I

574
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,509
realize that that was a little contrived

575
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:24,489
if the if the development team's goal is

576
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,220
to push code into production every four

577
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:28,749
hours and the security team says that

578
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,220
every single piece of code that goes

579
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:32,889
into production needs a manual code

580
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,619
review you can see how we would never be

581
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,918
on the same page they're aligning goals

582
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:40,749
is the first step to attaining them

583
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,359
because if there's ever if you've ever

584
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:46,570
worked at an organization where they had

585
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,699
waivers for things then you will know

586
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,879
how often that waiver system gets used

587
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,220
so one of my customers actually had a

588
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:55,928
waiver system so they could push code

589
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,570
into production that had high severity

590
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,330
vulnerabilities and every single time a

591
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,229
high severity vulnerability was find

592
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:07,090
found the team would just file file a

593
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:08,499
waiver and of course the code would go

594
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,668
into production anyway and they would

595
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:13,950
say yeah we'll put it in one of our

596
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:17,169
sprints I bet you it's still out there

597
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,599
information sharing is another area that

598
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:21,460
we struggle with a little bit and I

599
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,309
think it's the no patch for human

600
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,049
stupidity problem we feel quite often

601
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:28,269
that people will take the information

602
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,940
that we share and use it against us

603
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:33,039
so we're naturally kind of paranoid

604
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,849
about this stuff so we don't always

605
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,950
share information even with even with

606
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:41,649
the people internal to our organizations

607
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,690
so product teams development teams we

608
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:45,549
kind of guard information because we

609
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,590
feel that's our job and I think we

610
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:50,109
should find interesting ways to share

611
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,359
ideas and information in in forms like

612
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:54,489
this security conferences local security

613
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,009
meetups those are great opportunities to

614
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:58,479
talk to your peers because even if one

615
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,049
of your peers works at a competing

616
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:04,299
organization we all have the same goals

617
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:07,889
right we're all trying to secure our

618
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,889
organizations as best we can

619
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:15,580
silos are another this is kind of a pet

620
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:17,649
peeve of mine because multiple times in

621
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,590
my career I've been confronted with a

622
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:24,039
manager who is fresh off of reading the

623
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,779
newest management book and they would

624
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:29,279
try to implement the things in the book

625
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:31,989
without thinking about the intent right

626
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,310
the intent may be different than what

627
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:35,530
they're trying to do so

628
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,110
silo's between communication and

629
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:41,020
information sharing are bad I think we

630
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:45,520
can all agree but silos create expertise

631
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:46,600
so imagine this imagine you need an open

632
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,900
heart you need to have open heart

633
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,899
surgery you need a transplant so you go

634
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:56,050
to the hospital and to your horror you

635
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,540
see the proctologist scrubbing in to do

636
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,740
your heart transplant and they're doing

637
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:04,360
that because they're trying to break

638
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:07,600
down silos and get more exposure to the

639
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,979
proctologist with hearts it's probably

640
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,370
not something you want to do and this

641
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,650
image is perfect because that silos

642
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,669
falling in the wrong direction so I

643
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,860
didn't know that until I read the

644
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:22,510
description on the stock photo site that

645
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:27,429
I was using so cool we need to focus

646
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:29,830
more on enablement for our activities

647
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,570
and and what we do what we're trying to

648
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,439
do aligning goals we need to ask

649
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,570
ourselves what have what have we done to

650
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,110
enable the people and groups around us

651
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:44,770
what steps have we taken I'm willing to

652
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:47,919
bet that not many security teams have a

653
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:50,110
quality measurement for enablement maybe

654
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,290
it's getting a little bit more now but

655
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:56,290
we don't necessarily measure our success

656
00:27:53,290 --> 00:28:01,120
in enablement but maybe we should and we

657
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:03,670
can't say that our goal is to we've

658
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,399
enabled them basically by not letting

659
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,970
them get pwned because that's really not

660
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,590
a valid excuse and we can't also what

661
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,060
one of the things with enablement that I

662
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,889
should probably talk about is we don't

663
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,440
want to be the reason why an initiative

664
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,640
fails so if you're trying if your

665
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,990
company's trying to do something new

666
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,390
they're trying to launch a new product a

667
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,490
new service if they have an excuse to

668
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,650
point back at the security team for the

669
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:30,160
reason that initiative fails that's a

670
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,720
huge problem so if we focus on

671
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,060
enablement and the initiative fails then

672
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,740
they can't point back to us and say well

673
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,440
you know it was their fault

674
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,620
and if we look at disciplines that are

675
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:45,220
more human focused like case management

676
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,779
you come up with these phrases like this

677
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,599
in

678
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:51,629
and it may be a bit utopian to think

679
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:54,090
about security empowering people

680
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:56,129
although I guess it could if you're you

681
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,039
know if you're setting a higher level of

682
00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:01,769
security standards than we've basically

683
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:03,960
became an empowerment arm but for the

684
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:07,229
most part engage enable and enhance so

685
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,429
how how are we engaging the people we

686
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:15,389
serve how are we enabling them in their

687
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:17,429
mission and how in the end have we

688
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:21,389
enhanced the security posture of our

689
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:23,279
organization and one of the ways I think

690
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:26,099
we can begin that conversation is

691
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,710
through brainstorming brainstorming

692
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,080
sessions are great because they don't

693
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:34,589
cost you anything

694
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,349
you get free ideas for the span of an

695
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:40,469
hour or two or however long you're

696
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:42,450
brainstorming session lasts how many how

697
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:48,269
many people here in a security role do

698
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,769
regular brainstorming sessions few one

699
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:51,450
thing that you can do is bring people

700
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,979
into the conversation so if you do these

701
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,899
brainstorming sessions and you bring in

702
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:57,739
somebody from the product team or the

703
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:59,580
dev team it's a great way to increase

704
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:03,119
communication flow between the two

705
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,728
between the two groups you know removing

706
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,678
constraints and just saying let's throw

707
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:09,330
out some ideas and sometimes they get a

708
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,029
little ridiculous but sometimes in the

709
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,989
most ridiculous ideas there's a hint of

710
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:17,909
something that actually might work

711
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:22,019
another thing that you can do in this

712
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:23,729
area is prototypes if you're trying to

713
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,830
communicate something to one of the

714
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:27,210
teams if you're trying to say hey I want

715
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,330
to build this new dashboard and here's

716
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,919
all this information and and you're like

717
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,080
yeah that sounds good that sounds good

718
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,509
if you show them a prototype of it you

719
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,949
have a lot better chance of influencing

720
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:40,409
a decision in one way or the other

721
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,299
and I honestly don't know how anybody

722
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:44,429
does their job these days without

723
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,649
knowing how to at least program a little

724
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:48,509
bit but this isn't necessarily even

725
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:52,189
programming a solution this could be a

726
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:58,080
spreadsheet or a Word document

727
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:59,010
all right scale so scale causes us quite

728
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,560
a bit of problems

729
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,510
and if I'm going to be optimistic about

730
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,220
it it's going to cause us a whole lot

731
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,520
more problems over the next few years so

732
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,620
you have that to look forward to

733
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,620
everything is smart and if we measure if

734
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:17,340
a consumer measures right the definition

735
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:20,010
of the smartness of something it's

736
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,159
usually measured on its connectivity so

737
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,020
in the ancient days in the ancient times

738
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,570
you used to wear a fitness tracker for a

739
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,620
week a whole week before you'd plug it

740
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,550
into your computer and upload your

741
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:35,159
results nowadays your watch may have a

742
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,889
cellular connection and it may in real

743
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,610
time upload your results so we measure

744
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,900
this definition in our connections and

745
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,939
what this really does is it creates a

746
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,980
complex attack surface that's really

747
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,200
hard to wrap our minds around let's

748
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,030
think about something that everybody

749
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,150
that we always tell people they need to

750
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:56,070
do like patching this becomes infinitely

751
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,260
complex when you think of patching and

752
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,070
Product Lifecycle so for something like

753
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,960
your phone your watch a tablet it's easy

754
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,000
to see how over the next couple years

755
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,910
you're gonna replace that device anyway

756
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,070
cuz that's just what people do but what

757
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,260
happens when that phone becomes a

758
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,840
refrigerator or a car

759
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,840
these aren't normally things that we

760
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,100
replace every couple years that's going

761
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,020
to be a problem

762
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,060
because it's not realistic to think that

763
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,900
that product manufacturer is going to

764
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:30,510
support that device for infinitely as

765
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,300
long as the car lasts some cars are

766
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:34,950
twenty thirty years old and we could

767
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,020
just say well you know just disconnect

768
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:40,160
the car or disconnect the refrigerator

769
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,850
but it might not work you know if that

770
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,400
refrigerator doesn't have an internet

771
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:48,600
connection it may not regulate the

772
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:51,660
coolness and may just next thing you

773
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,370
know you have warm drinks so we need to

774
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,820
think about this because it's not a

775
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:58,649
matter of if it's when because these

776
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,600
devices are out there now and if you

777
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,610
think hey that smart refrigerator a

778
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,159
smart refrigerator is never going to

779
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:07,229
make it into my workplace I would urge

780
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,960
you to not think that way because many

781
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,690
people said that about the iPhone hey

782
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,860
that's cool and all but I just can't see

783
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:18,020
ever needing anything other than my

784
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:22,500
blackberry and look where we're at today

785
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:24,180
there's this modern reality to that even

786
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,860
the things that we purchase kind of work

787
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,870
against us the services we use work

788
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,490
against us and Bruce Schneier had this

789
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,260
quote that I liked it's like everyone

790
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,600
wants you to have security except from

791
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,100
them so Google wants you to have

792
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,810
security except they want to be able to

793
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,280
read all your email and serve you ads

794
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,230
Facebook wants you to have security

795
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,020
except they want to understand you so

796
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,270
intimately that they can target ads the

797
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,250
government wants you to have security

798
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,629
until they think you can committed a

799
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,770
crime and then they want to have access

800
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:54,870
to everything we can take this to supply

801
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,060
chain issues which have been a real

802
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:00,629
problem because the computers we use on

803
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:05,460
a daily basis we trust an amazing amount

804
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:07,170
of things that system was built in one

805
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,550
place the components are manufactured in

806
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:13,260
another and every single piece of

807
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:16,830
software we basically trust and on that

808
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,190
front machine learning why not let's

809
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:22,110
talk about let's throw buzzword in here

810
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,030
when we approach problems from a

811
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,590
security perspective quite often what

812
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,690
we're doing is we're thinking of

813
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,480
confidentiality when we think of a

814
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:33,300
breach we think of losing sensitive data

815
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,400
and I think in the future that is going

816
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,740
to be less of a problem than integrity

817
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,710
so from your favorite certification exam

818
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:43,139
the CIA triad confidentiality integrity

819
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,389
and availability confidentiality is

820
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,529
usually what we're worried about

821
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:50,639
availability is a business problem and

822
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:53,220
integrity who cares but we've run into

823
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,739
so many systems these days that are

824
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:59,160
autonomous that consume information

825
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:02,250
without human input and makes decisions

826
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,379
on our behalf so in the future integrity

827
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,630
is going to become much more important

828
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,310
and even availability won't necessarily

829
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:14,520
be a business problem what happens when

830
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:17,580
a surgical robot loses connectivity in

831
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,070
the middle of a surgery I'm asking I

832
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,779
don't know I haven't looked it up but

833
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,490
those are the questions that we need to

834
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,490
ask that's an availability problem

835
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:33,459
we can't solve problems of scale alone

836
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:35,790
that is just a fact so we aren't going

837
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,290
to solve these problems individually

838
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,779
especially think about patching think

839
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,160
about smart refrigerators how do you as

840
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,280
a security professional solve that

841
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,109
problem and one of the ways that we can

842
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,430
try to affect that change or secure by

843
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:50,078
default or any of these other things

844
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,669
we're trying to affect one of the ways

845
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,140
we can do that is by banding together

846
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:58,570
and forcing the vendor to provide us a

847
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,279
solution we shouldn't allow vendors to

848
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,690
just sell a stuff when they haven't

849
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,070
thought about the impacts of their

850
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,070
technology on our day to day business

851
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,589
fixing problems of scale we need to

852
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,630
think beyond patching we need to push

853
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:16,570
for security controls and baselines

854
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,460
armed people with the right tools so if

855
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,800
we give people tools to solve a security

856
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,349
problem it better work properly because

857
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,420
you won't get another chance we need to

858
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,579
look for options for self-service so

859
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,339
maybe that's what ever you can

860
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:32,470
self-service and that gets more time off

861
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:37,150
of your security team and leverage

862
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:39,160
automation velocity velocity is a

863
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:42,160
favorite topic of mine lately because

864
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:47,799
everything is fast so in the good old

865
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,450
days development had stages and at each

866
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,550
stage we could plug in a security

867
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,439
process and I think that that made us

868
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,790
feel good and then development teams are

869
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,490
like oh we don't do things that way

870
00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:00,160
anymore we just kind of wing it okay

871
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,319
it's they don't wing it they have agile

872
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,598
methods there the message have changed

873
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,670
the viewpoints have changed some some

874
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:09,490
organizations probably still do have a

875
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,569
release engineer whose developers can't

876
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,598
push code into production

877
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:16,210
that's something else's job but those

878
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,119
days are gone for the most part and

879
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:22,420
customers are used to fast so it's not

880
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,880
if we ask our businesses hey we should

881
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,069
probably slow down that's not going to

882
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:32,170
be a good day for us and on this front

883
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:34,450
and I really hate the term dev sack ops

884
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,970
not because I think the concepts are bad

885
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,770
is just that some vendors have latched

886
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,470
on to this

887
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,630
term and it's used in every single piece

888
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,209
of communication every single slide deck

889
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:48,030
every single everything so but that is

890
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,220
one way to solve the security problem

891
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,770
because we have an obligation to make

892
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,580
whatever solution we're putting in place

893
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:58,920
usable accessible and simple and

894
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,540
probably many of you have run into

895
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,580
somebody who never put a password on

896
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,650
their phone never put a passphrase

897
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,960
because it was too inconvenient and then

898
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,310
the use of biometrics became more of a

899
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,080
thing and then all of a sudden now

900
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,420
they're at least locking their phone so

901
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,100
is that the most perfect solution no but

902
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,850
is it better than not having anything

903
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:20,640
yes once again going back to solutions

904
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:23,640
that are imperfect but better than where

905
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,680
we were we also need to think about how

906
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,080
we incentivize the people in our

907
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,319
organizations because we like to say

908
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,759
complexity is the enemy of security but

909
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,300
every single day that people in our

910
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,180
organizations are ranked on adding

911
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,670
complexity and features so that type of

912
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,470
scenario really does work against us and

913
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,910
hal VAR had this quote that I really

914
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,129
liked it says nobody ever gets promoted

915
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:51,299
for saying I deleted 800 lines of code

916
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:53,070
and this is a tough problem and there

917
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,920
aren't a lot of really good solutions so

918
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:58,050
I would say you know let everybody have

919
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,610
a code removal sprint but I'm sure

920
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,760
everybody in the room would laugh me off

921
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:04,680
the stage so that is a tough problem and

922
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,080
and I think the word that starts is

923
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,520
having a conversation with the

924
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,310
management of the organization and

925
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,320
stressing the fact that there is code

926
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:16,170
today that you push to your customers

927
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,800
that is not used by them that is opening

928
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:23,010
your attack surface but what we can do

929
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,230
is leverage velocity so we can take the

930
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,840
thing that's working against us and use

931
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,600
it to our benefit so as velocity

932
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,950
increases so does responsibility so if

933
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,420
you're a developer and you're pushing

934
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,669
code into production every couple of

935
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,080
hours you probably won't last very long

936
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,380
if you keep breaking things every time

937
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,230
you push something into production so

938
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:45,120
the best way we can do this is to try

939
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,520
and convince the development teams that

940
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,319
code quality and security increase

941
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,370
reliability

942
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,200
the utilizing security champions is

943
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:57,890
another way to do this and I like

944
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,939
activities like threat modeling because

945
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,460
when you teach somebody how to threat

946
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,950
model they don't ever really turn that

947
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,080
off so the more people you teach the

948
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,430
threat model you you you come to find

949
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,080
out yeah that's just kind of how they

950
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,720
always think now like you can't you

951
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,299
can't turn it off so that's one of the

952
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,509
reasons I like threat modeling and you

953
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,560
don't really get multiple shots at this

954
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,630
so if you're gonna put something in

955
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,590
place you probably should make sure it's

956
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:28,580
going to work in that situation first

957
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:33,150
and don't make people do your thing so

958
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:36,270
if we purchase a solution if we go down

959
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:40,260
that road we probably shouldn't crank it

960
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:42,450
up to 11 let's see 10 minutes because

961
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,280
that increases friction and friction is

962
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:48,600
what we're trying to remove this is

963
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,910
probably not going to be a popular

964
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,560
viewpoint but bug bounties will not save

965
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:56,100
you I know everybody loves a good bug

966
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,520
bounty but securing your organization

967
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,140
isn't a matter of having more bugs so if

968
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,640
you are a very mature organization you

969
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,520
have a lot of steps down and you might

970
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,830
find that bug bounties provide you a

971
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,220
valuable service and we should we should

972
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:13,670
reward people for finding bugs in our

973
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,680
products what I am opposed to is

974
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,120
replacing another structured process

975
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:22,230
with a bug bounty because they're not

976
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:25,529
meant to solve the same problems moving

977
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:28,290
along here's another thing to think

978
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:31,050
about in this last section our problems

979
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:34,230
are not local anymore our problem we

980
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:37,710
have global problems somebody in one

981
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,810
part of the world can release an app and

982
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,690
have it be consumed in another part of

983
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:45,540
the world in the same day quite often in

984
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,310
a matter of minutes so we need to keep

985
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,750
this in mind as we think about our

986
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:57,270
strategy the skills gap that everybody

987
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:58,980
reads about is a problem so different

988
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,420
sources kind of have different sets of

989
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,700
numbers but they're in the millions

990
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,460
millions of people

991
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,740
we have a gap in our in our community

992
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,069
and although that sounds good for us for

993
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,618
our longevity it's not necessarily good

994
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:16,980
for us from a planetary perspective when

995
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,930
we require safety so I would like to

996
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,789
think about different ways to solve the

997
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,618
skills gap and if you thought I was

998
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:25,950
gonna say artificial intelligence you'd

999
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,510
be wrong because even though it's cool

1000
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,730
to think about vendors creating AI

1001
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,880
products that replace humans one of the

1002
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,730
things that AI does not do is replace

1003
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,470
expertise right so somebody needs to

1004
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,859
come up with a strategy somebody needs

1005
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:43,439
to implement these tools and one of the

1006
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,788
ways you can diversify your team is by

1007
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,339
looking for things that you want to do

1008
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:50,460
so if you're having a hard time hiring

1009
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:53,670
security people why not hire a developer

1010
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:56,609
or somebody to prototype things or a

1011
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:58,170
data scientist and then think about what

1012
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:00,089
capabilities that would bring to your

1013
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,549
team so even if you aren't creating

1014
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:04,650
products for other business units you

1015
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:06,059
may have a pile of data that would be

1016
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,400
valuable to you to have better

1017
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:10,109
visibility into maybe it would be a

1018
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,210
better from a delivery perspective if

1019
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:14,190
you had a different way of presenting

1020
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,980
data to your internal or external

1021
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:19,500
customers and that's really where adding

1022
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,059
additional capabilities helps diversity

1023
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,470
and backgrounds it also gives you a new

1024
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,420
way of thinking about things because

1025
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,459
people from other disciplines tend to

1026
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,779
think differently and that's one thing

1027
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,519
that we've had a problem we can think

1028
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:30,779
like attackers very well but sometimes

1029
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,189
when we're trying to think like another

1030
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:36,329
group it doesn't always work out

1031
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:39,630
internships are another thing that are

1032
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:42,180
what you make of them if you see an

1033
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:44,220
internship as some sort of burden that

1034
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,950
needs to be managed then that's exactly

1035
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,598
what it'll be but one of the things that

1036
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:50,910
you get from an internship that I think

1037
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,210
many people don't think about is that an

1038
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:57,180
internship can provide you a source of

1039
00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:00,509
ideas that is untainted by your company

1040
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,839
so we kind of get caught up in the

1041
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:05,579
company politics and it's hard for us to

1042
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,369
break out of that sometimes but an

1043
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:11,039
intern they've never been exposed to

1044
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,079
your internal politics so they could be

1045
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,150
a valuable source of new ideas and of

1046
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,079
course if they're good then you can help

1047
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,319
fill the skills gap

1048
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,680
on that front but speaking of people on

1049
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:25,469
our security teams one of the things

1050
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,359
that I think many security groups don't

1051
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:30,329
do is provide some sort of business

1052
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,269
education so if you have a small company

1053
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:35,369
and you make one product maybe that's

1054
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:37,319
not very complex but if you work at a

1055
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:40,140
large organization with multiple pillars

1056
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:41,880
and multiple income streams it becomes a

1057
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,549
lot harder to understand where all that

1058
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,859
money comes from and how all the units

1059
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:49,259
of the business work together we like to

1060
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:51,690
talk about creating security champions

1061
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:53,430
but we don't always want to be business

1062
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,459
champions we think that's everybody

1063
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,049
else's job but the more plugged in to

1064
00:44:56,459 --> 00:45:00,359
the business you get the more of an

1065
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:01,920
understanding you get the better off you

1066
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,869
are because it means you can communicate

1067
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,489
with the people that you're trying to

1068
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,660
affect change on you understand where

1069
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:08,160
they're coming from you understand why

1070
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,950
they may or may not be doing something

1071
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,348
and maybe that means that we need to

1072
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:16,019
choose a different route if we know that

1073
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:19,200
something is a problem then maybe we

1074
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:21,598
need to do something else that solves

1075
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:27,589
our goal but like meets their goals as

1076
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:30,059
well so retain and diversify team's

1077
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:32,519
business education creating business

1078
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:35,039
champions university partnerships pretty

1079
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:38,578
much every organization has an office

1080
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:42,390
that's in proximity to some university

1081
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:43,769
some opportunity there and make make

1082
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,140
your accomplishments known that's one of

1083
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:47,578
this I had like 80 slides I'm sorry so

1084
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,769
that came from one of the other slides

1085
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:53,400
but if you'd like to talk about that I'm

1086
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:57,328
more than happy to do that afterwards so

1087
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,660
with all the slides that I skipped this

1088
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:03,029
is the summary so a few things I'd like

1089
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,890
you to take away from what I said today

1090
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:07,739
one of them is just not being difficult

1091
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:12,180
or have empathy and understand why

1092
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:15,869
people may be pushing back solutions

1093
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:19,259
don't need to be perfect now we need to

1094
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:22,019
look for ways to turn pep kak into a CAC

1095
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:24,660
or whatever opportunities exist between

1096
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:26,879
keyboard and chair increased

1097
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,160
communication do more brainstorming

1098
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,660
sessions with people outside

1099
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:36,140
our group's new perspectives diversify

1100
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,339
your security team and add more

1101
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,770
capabilities because that's really the

1102
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:43,170
way to look at it it's not that well I

1103
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:45,329
had a security gap so I just filled it

1104
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:47,130
with somebody else and now I guess I can

1105
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:49,740
do this know there's an opportunity

1106
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:54,930
there to increase your service to

1107
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:59,788
increase capabilities align goals with

1108
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:01,618
other business units because if we are

1109
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:05,130
on the wrong page if we are on different

1110
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:07,940
pages we'll never be successful focus on

1111
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,640
enable Minh and reducing friction and

1112
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,680
more focus on integrity over

1113
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:17,690
confidentiality and availability I think

1114
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:24,020
that's coming very soon so with that

1115
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:24,020
that's my talk thank you

1116
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,770
yeah I don't this is the last talk of

1117
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,960
the day so I'm going to be hanging out

1118
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:37,509
for a while if anybody has any questions

1119
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,880
I'll also be doing one of the community

1120
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,470
breaks tomorrow at 2:00 something I

1121
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,270
think it's in your schedule where I'm

1122
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:47,350
going to be talking about security

1123
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:50,590
agility and adding agile components to

1124
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:53,020
security programs and from here I'm

1125
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:54,970
leaving and going to an event here I'll

1126
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,890
stay as long as you have questions but

1127
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:04,439
you're more than welcome to follow me to

1128
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:04,440
the event all right thank you
