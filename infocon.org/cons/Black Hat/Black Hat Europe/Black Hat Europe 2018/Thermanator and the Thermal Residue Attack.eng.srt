1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
hello my name is Arjun o circ and I'm a

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,200
PhD student in computer science at

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,170
University of California Irvine and

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,620
today I will talk about the Terminator

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,129
thermal residue attacks on thermal

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,560
residue attacks against password on

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:23,220
external keyboards this is joint work

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,939
with Tyler Katz Marek and jeans FeliCa

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,419
from university of california irvine

10
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:31,980
let's first discuss a common scenario

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:36,120
let's assume that you are working at a

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,550
shared workspace and you are I work in

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,370
the morning and then you go to your desk

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,069
and workstation enter your password

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,530
hopefully your workstation is password

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,820
protected and you enter your password

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,699
and then while you're waiting for the

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,050
login process to finish either you get

19
00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:01,199
bored or a login process finishes you

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,170
check a few emails you click you click

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,679
the mouse a few times then a colleague

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,780
comes in and calls you to a meeting or

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,710
to just get some coffee

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,259
or you just decide to step away on your

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,699
own to get some coffee or go to the

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,520
bathroom or something like that and you

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,610
might be security conscience and you

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,699
might lock your computer and this

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,610
actually looks like everything is fine

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,650
you did everything by the book and by

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,350
locking your computer you prevented any

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,299
lunchtime attacks but is there actually

33
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,089
a problem with this scenario and the

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,570
answer is yes and the problem is you

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,950
didn't wear your oven mitts and the

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,820
reason for that is or any you are

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,820
wearing any other thermal insulator is

38
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,398
humans are warm-blooded and we actually

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,139
leave thermal residues on things with

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,190
which we come in contact and these ink

41
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,890
keyboards and the keyboards are mostly

42
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:16,490
made of plastic and they are poor

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,929
conductors and they retain heat for a

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,300
while and you can see an image here

45
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,820
password' actually here is password and

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,690
you can clearly see the keys pressed on

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,590
this image which says that this might be

48
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,840
actually an attack surface and related

49
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,780
work on this area mainly focused on

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,480
recovering pins four-digit pins mostly

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,930
and first work by is a less key on

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,560
cracking seis and more-- at all did some

53
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:52,640
work on comparing material composition

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,880
of the target and camera distance using

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,059
a thermal camera and they also worked on

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,040
some different data analysis methods in

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,160
addition model and hands leak has shown

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,989
that there are multiple devices that

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,480
might be vulnerable to thermal thermal

60
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:16,190
residue attacks and there is also some

61
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,488
work on mobile devices to mostly recover

62
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:22,100
screen lock patterns but there has been

63
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,440
no systematic investigation of thermal

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,799
residues on external keyboards and

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,700
especially for passwords this was our

66
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:37,820
main motivation to do this research and

67
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:40,970
work and we discovered or we define an

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,390
attack which is terminator and it's also

69
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,090
known as coffee break attack and comes

70
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,029
with two flavors the opportunistic one

71
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,010
is the victim steps away after typing

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,010
their passwords on their own accord and

73
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,109
the orchestrated one there's an

74
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,390
accomplice which draws the victim away

75
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,269
and then the attacker can take the

76
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:07,369
thermal picture of the keyboards and

77
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:09,799
then evaluate the results and image it

78
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,030
gets so we actually have two videos that

79
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:17,170
describes this attack in in a more

80
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,170
visual way

81
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,670
[Applause]

82
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,320
this was the opportunistic version of

83
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,320
the attack and there is the orchestra

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,930
[Music]

85
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,940
had some questions in mind about this

86
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,679
attack for example how dangerous are

87
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,440
these thermal sight channel based

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,360
attacks and what is the realistic attack

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,880
window because that's gonna play an

90
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,280
important role and what does attack

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,650
success actually require does it depend

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,809
on user's physical attributes for

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,090
example fingertip size and shape and

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,430
pressure applied pressure while typing

95
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,310
the key or does it depend on password

96
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,400
strength comparing weak passwords to

97
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,860
strong passwords or does it depend on

98
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,810
typing style hunt-and-peck versus touch

99
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,200
typing which we'll go into more detail

100
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:17,940
and does it depend on keyboard type

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:21,360
brand and model and we did experiments

102
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,040
to actually get answers to these

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,720
questions our attacker had was a

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,060
moderate

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,400
TACA which has access to a mid-range

106
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,540
thermal camera in our case this was a

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,450
floor SC 620 and it cost around $1500

108
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,170
and it has a thermal imaging frequency

109
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:44,620
of 1 Hertz it can take one image every

110
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:49,970
second and it looks like actually a

111
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:52,280
video recorder basically and this camera

112
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,310
when we compared to other options in the

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,369
market which cost around $25,000 and

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:02,570
$100,000 it's a pretty moderate attacker

115
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:07,960
model and we did experiments this was

116
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:11,360
our experiment setting you can see the

117
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:16,099
thermal camera perched on on top of the

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,740
tripod on top of the keyboard and we

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,750
designed a two-stage experiment in the

120
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:26,690
first stage we recruited 31 subjects and

121
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,360
each entered 10 passwords on 4 different

122
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:33,320
keyboards and we took images of these

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,190
keyboards up to 1 minute and at the end

124
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,010
we had 60 images some of these passwords

125
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:43,190
were weak like password football and I

126
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,590
love you which we gathered from recent

127
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,290
data dumps and some of them were strong

128
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,810
they were randomly generated by us and

129
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,120
they had different lengths eight

130
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,140
characters 10 characters and 12

131
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,020
characters and these password warrior

132
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:04,669
entered on four popular keyboards one

133
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:08,990
Dell HP Logitech and a zo here's the

134
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:13,090
sample video that images actually added

135
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,090
together and how it looks

136
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:23,580
you can see that the password here is

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:26,820
actually password and even in that five

138
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,310
second loop you can still see that in

139
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,950
the last few tens of seconds you can

140
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:36,150
still see a few keys but how do we

141
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,598
actually quantify the attack success for

142
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:43,439
that we design another experiment the

143
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,500
stage two which had eight non-expert

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,400
subjects acting as adversaries and they

145
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,550
were shown 150 film thermal recordings

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,250
of thermal recordings in random order

147
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,560
and they were asked to identify lit

148
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,220
regions they were not asked to guess

149
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,939
password we just asked them to see think

150
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,570
which regions are actually lit on the

151
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:13,400
thermal images and let's take a look at

152
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,400
the results

153
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,500
we should probably first discuss about

154
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:23,220
our distance metric here to the actual

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,950
between the actual password and the set

156
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:30,630
of keys that our stage two subjects were

157
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:33,300
able to get from the thermal images here

158
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,300
we have for distance calculation between

159
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,180
those two we summed up the number of

160
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,300
missed keys by our stage two subjects

161
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:47,880
and number of misidentified as pressed

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:52,099
keys and the time here shows that the

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:56,670
latest time that this distance was was

164
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:00,000
the number given here an example here we

165
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:02,640
have football in the first part and we

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,310
can see that the first part is D equals

167
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,790
zero which means that all keys in the

168
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:11,209
password were able to be were able to be

169
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,579
recovered by our stage two subjects and

170
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:17,910
they were able to do that until the 18th

171
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,820
around 18th second for I love you this

172
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,500
was around 30 second for password this

173
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,500
was around 20th second

174
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:34,080
for alphanumeric password the results

175
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,330
are similar we are just showing these in

176
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,050
two cat two different images for ease of

177
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,089
viewing for example for one two three

178
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,060
four five six seven eight full recovery

179
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,649
was around twenty seconds and Jordan

180
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,349
twenty-three around 20 seconds and

181
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,269
password around 20 seconds four one two

182
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,640
three four one two three four that was

183
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:58,950
an interesting case since each key is

184
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:02,160
actually pressed twice it helped our

185
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,709
stage two subjects identify which keys

186
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,560
were pressed for a longer period of time

187
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:13,859
around 45 seconds when we take a look at

188
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,018
the results for secure passwords we can

189
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,550
see that the full recovery time which is

190
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:23,519
the equal zero the blue bars is drops

191
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,790
actually it drops compared to the other

192
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,089
ones compared to insecure passwords and

193
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,800
the reason probably for that is since

194
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,860
these are actually randomly generated

195
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,859
passwords they have not been seen by our

196
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,829
stage one subjects it took a longer time

197
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:46,380
for them for them to find the keys and

198
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:48,660
then press those keys and the for the

199
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,050
first password this was around 15

200
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,010
seconds 10 seconds and around 15 seconds

201
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:58,920
and while going over the results we

202
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:04,529
discovered that also the typing style is

203
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:06,630
one of the differences between created

204
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:09,270
differences between the success of our

205
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,420
stage two subjects for example you can

206
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:17,730
see here a hunt-and-peck typist typing

207
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:23,250
Jordan 23 and every key press here is a

208
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:25,740
key in the password but when we take a

209
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,769
look at at touch typist typing one two

210
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,370
three four five six seven eight we can

211
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:34,700
see that there are additional keys asdf

212
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,850
JKL and semicolon

213
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:42,020
which are usually used by touch typists

214
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,660
they perch their hands on the home row

215
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,420
which are these keys in addition to that

216
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,910
these actually thermal residues lead to

217
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,530
other keys close by those home row keys

218
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,589
and created confusion for our stage two

219
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:02,060
subjects so when we compare these two

220
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:05,030
styles to typing styles for alphabetical

221
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,359
passwords we can see a drop in full

222
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:11,870
recovery in the blue bars for football

223
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,780
it was around 25 to 30 seconds but for

224
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,600
touch typist for touch typist

225
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,720
you just drop down to around 15 seconds

226
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,140
and there is a similar trend for all

227
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,850
these passwords when we compare

228
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,350
hunt-and-peck typist and touch typists

229
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,870
also the same case for alphanumeric

230
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,090
password except one two three four one

231
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,090
two three four we can see that other

232
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:42,830
passwords actually full recovery time

233
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:44,450
were actually dropped as mentioned

234
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,780
before one two three four one two three

235
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,750
four is a special case that we see since

236
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,959
each K each key is typed twice it's

237
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,170
easier to recover also in our distance

238
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:00,860
metric we did not add the home row keys

239
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:03,439
as false because there is no way to

240
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,710
understand whether those keys are

241
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,740
actually pressed or those keys are there

242
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:14,870
just because the touch typist kept their

243
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:17,630
hands on they own those keys also for

244
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,630
secure passwords we can see that full

245
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,320
recovered time from for the first

246
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,439
password

247
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:30,640
drops from 30 seconds to around 10

248
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:34,340
seconds so all in all our results were

249
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:38,420
entire I fee for password recovery

250
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:41,750
entire set of key presses our stage two

251
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:45,059
subjects were able to recover entire set

252
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,829
of key presses as late as 30 seconds and

253
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:50,339
they were able to recover partial sets

254
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:52,618
up to one minute which shows the that

255
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,369
this attack is actually can be

256
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:58,319
successful and when we compare typing

257
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:01,019
styles hunt-and-peck typists are

258
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:03,748
especially vulnerable since every key

259
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:08,759
they press is actually a key in the

260
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:11,159
password when we take a look at the data

261
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,859
to see whether we can get gather any

262
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:17,789
ordering information our stage two

263
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:21,119
subjects did not were not able to come

264
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:24,479
up with reliable or key press ordering

265
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:28,139
information and the possible reasons for

266
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:30,659
this is pressure timing and area

267
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:34,199
differences of fingers and presses and

268
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:37,979
also combinations of all these factors

269
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,439
but we have dictionaries for non-random

270
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:43,019
passwords we can describe a distance

271
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:45,718
metric like one with it and we can use

272
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,999
that distance metric to compare the keys

273
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:52,879
that we are seeing in the image to the

274
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:55,769
passwords in in a password dictionary

275
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:59,069
how do we mitigate how do we prevent

276
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:02,099
actually this Terminator attacks we can

277
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:04,049
introduce chaff typing typing extra keys

278
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:06,689
while we are typing our passwords or

279
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:09,718
swiping on the keyboard when we are done

280
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:11,728
with typing our password and in addition

281
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:14,309
to that we can consider keyboard list

282
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:17,659
entry keyboard lose password entry

283
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:19,889
options for example using using a mouse

284
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:21,299
displayed character characters are

285
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,489
displayed on the screen they are in

286
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:27,589
random order and we can pick these keys

287
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:32,429
or we move away from passwords which

288
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:36,059
does not seem to be which which probably

289
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:40,259
is not going to happen in the close

290
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:42,868
future and another option is for

291
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:46,740
mitigation using long actually nails

292
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:49,370
close or as we said before oven mitts

293
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,260
actually we had one subjects who had

294
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,350
long acrylic nails and we were not able

295
00:16:52,260 --> 00:17:00,210
to see anything on the any of the

296
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:03,780
thermal images that we gathered blackhat

297
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,420
soundbites using plastic keyboards to

298
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,720
enter password is even less secure than

299
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:13,680
previously recognized post factum which

300
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,750
means that after the fact of entering

301
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,000
our password thermal imaging attacks are

302
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,450
realistic and one of the reasons for

303
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,609
that is niche devices such as thermal

304
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,950
cameras are becoming more mainstream and

305
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,740
more accessible which makes these

306
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:32,550
attacks which makes these attacks more

307
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,420
realistic now and we should either stop

308
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:40,550
using keyboards for password entry or

309
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:43,740
abandon passwords altogether if possible

310
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:47,460
so further info can be found on the

311
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:51,560
project website and our group at UC

312
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:56,010
Irvine is sprout and the full paper is

313
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:59,870
available on archive and if you have any

314
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,870
questions I'll be happy to answer them

315
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,299
questions

316
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,790

[Music]

318
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:33,270
you know why

319
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:37,050
it does yes even if you see that shift

320
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:40,560
is pressed you don't have much idea on

321
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:44,399
actually which keys which keys were

322
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,200
pressed with shift so you might not you

323
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,440
don't get much enough information from

324
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,440
that

325
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,570
localization pages make a today

326
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,300
since all captains of

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,989
[Music]

328
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:32,130
for non-random passwords we can use

329
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:35,399
dictionaries with a distance metric for

330
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,080
random passwords it is not easy to get

331
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,000
the ordering information actually for

332
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,770
any password it's not easy to get the

333
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,350
ordering information from the thermal

334
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:48,870
images but as you said using a

335
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:52,649
permutation is might be actually pretty

336
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,840
big space for for random passwords but

337
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,870
one thing since we are considering the

338
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,540
inside your attacker here and inside our

339
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,629
attacker can use other side channels to

340
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,990
actually improve that your chances of

341
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,810
getting the random passwords - for

342
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,050
example using acoustics - acoustic

343
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:17,389
emanations to have an idea on which keys

344
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,389
are actually pressed and in which order

345
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,719

346
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:43,050
[Music]

347
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:47,040
we actually did a few experiments with

348
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:48,750
keep laptops - but as you said since the

349
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,690
CPU is actually a right under the

350
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,460
keyboard it actually even if you press a

351
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,850
key it is not easy to actually

352
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,010
understand that key has been pressed

353
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:03,540
also the same same scenario applies if

354
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:05,100
you have a smart phone those those

355
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,139
devices are pretty compact and

356
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,060
everything is basically together under

357
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,550
your screen you have your CPU which

358
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,800
heats up screen and also the screen

359
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,620
actually heats up too so it's not easy

360
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,540
to understand those keys have impressed

361
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,449
any or any patterns that you're entering

362
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,840
on your smart phone and one of the

363
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,510
papers actually worked on this area they

364
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,540
use cold boots they just turn on the

365
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,670
phone they entered the pin and the swipe

366
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,770
pattern or the swipe pattern and then

367
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:40,110
they try to get the pattern or pin and

368
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,170
they were not able to get it in in other

369
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,290
way like your phone is on for a long

370
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:51,740
time then it's probably not possible to

371
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,740
get the keys swipe patterns and pins

372
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:07,470

[Music]

374
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:16,389
we use a camera that was around $1,500

375
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:20,290
used we have not experimented with more

376
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,990
like a 25,000 and $100,000 camera I am

377
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,240
not sure actually how successful the

378
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,820
attack is going to be but if this

379
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,930
sensitivity is pretty high then you

380
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:34,750
might have a chance of getting more

381
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,990
fine-grain thermal images so that you

382
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,730
can observe the keys better and maybe

383
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,880
you might be able to get the ordering

384
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,880
information

385
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,780
question

386
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:10,750
so another question initially what to

387
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,210
Venice for the company to us so what

388
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,240
would you impose as a countermeasure you

389
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,240
know virtual environment very conscious

390
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
people

391
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,479
for external keyboards one mitigation

392
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,609
might be just swiping your hands after

393
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:36,059
entering your password that might be an

394
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:38,879
option or I think one of the one of

395
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,549
these solutions that we saw and it was

396
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:43,529
actually patented I think like the

397
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:47,129
heating up actually the keyboard

398
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:50,219
actually is heated up to the maybe the

399
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:52,498
finger temperature so that even if

400
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:55,109
you're actually pressing the key then

401
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:57,119
you will not be able to see the key but

402
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:59,069
if you for example wash your hands and

403
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,099
the temperature of your hands change

404
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:14,519
then you might still be able to see the

405
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:17,009
keys pressed any any change in the

406
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:20,449
temperature actually gives you a sight

407
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:20,449
channel on the password entry

408
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,620
thank you for
