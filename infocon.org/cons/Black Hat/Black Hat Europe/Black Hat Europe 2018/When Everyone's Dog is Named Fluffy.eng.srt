1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
hello everybody and welcome to our talk

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,949
when everyone's dog named fluffy today

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,200
we're going to talk about the brand new

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,450
security question feature of Windows 10

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,899
and now it could be abused by attackers

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,180
to gain domain wide persistence my name

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,730
is Tom Sela led security research at

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,310
elusive networks and here with me Miguel

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,250
with a researcher at elusive networks at

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,000
illusive we are creating deceptions to

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,660
detect advanced attackers let's dive

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,239
right in as I said we're deception

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,010
researchers deceptions are basically

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,290
piece of information planted by

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,019
defenders in order to trick attackers

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,870
and detect them and we research a place

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,570
called LSA secrets which usually old

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,660
binary information and while researching

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,140
the LSD secrets we stumble upon dead

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,809
string what was your pet's first you

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,670
know first pet's name that was kind of

22
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,000
strange because we didn't expect to find

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,129
such streams at the NSA secrets and at

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,930
that point we decided that this is

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,540
interesting we should dive into it to

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,830
understand what is it all about and the

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,720
talk that you are going to hear is the

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,929
outcome of our journey to understand

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,689
what is this string and whether there

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:23,700
are any security implications of it

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,309
being there so what was it Windows

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,829
introduced a new feature in last April a

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,880
security question feature it enables

34
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,548
local user to reset their passwords then

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,820
to answer correctly three out of six

36
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,939
predefined security questions and as you

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,079
just saw the questions and answers are

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,548
stored in the LSA secrets a typical flow

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,979
will go as follows

40
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,200
the user is unable to enter his correct

41
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,200
password you'll be presented with a

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,450
reset password button and then it will

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,689
be able to answer correctly three

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,939
questions you will be able to reset its

45
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,298
password to a new password and gain

46
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,310
access to his machine and generally

47
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,739
security questions is not a new thing

48
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,520
they've been around for a very long time

49
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,980
it was in

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,490
initially used by financial Institute's

51
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,190
to identify their customers in the early

52
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,530
2000s it became widely used by many

53
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,100
websites in order to enable users to

54
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:30,370
reset their passwords but nowadays many

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,489
questioned our secure are security

56
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,860
questions and most reset password

57
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,410
mechanisms usually involve multi-factor

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,290
authentication and it made us wonder

59
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:45,690
what made Microsoft decide to introduce

60
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:49,750
such a feature in 2018 and because

61
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:53,079
security questions like passwords enable

62
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,930
users to gain access to a new system we

63
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,600
want to compare how how they're secured

64
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,940
and whether the same mechanisms that

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,579
were introduced to make passwords more

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,350
secure we're also applied to security

67
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,380
questions and we compare the

68
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,630
implementation of the two at Windows so

69
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,450
passwords have complexity requirements

70
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,370
and expiration date the two does not

71
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,350
apply to security questions I do not

72
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,980
know anybody that is modern maiden name

73
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:24,400
ever changed from an administration

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,410
perspective admins can set GPOs that

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,740
control our users will use their

76
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,350
passwords while the same does not apply

77
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,720
to security question we did not find any

78
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,980
GPO or any kind of admin setting that

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,530
can enable administer control our users

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,549
are using the security questions from

81
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,900
auditing perspective there are various

82
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,210
events that are generated whenever a

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,370
user uses his password correctly or

84
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,770
incorrectly while the same does not

85
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,260
apply to security questions there is

86
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,890
only one single event that is generated

87
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,480
whenever a user resets is password but

88
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,450
there are no events that are created

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,480
whenever a user creates or sets is

90
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,760
security question and lastly from a

91
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,590
social engineering perspective we all

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,560
know that passwords are not immune to

93
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,358
social engineering but the situation is

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
much worse when it comes to security

95
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,459
question an attacker can even get

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,070
information online you can get access

97
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,049
Facebook and find out what's what school

98
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,699
you went to

99
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,590
and in recent years there are many

100
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,349
attacks that involves such a scenario of

101
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:35,758
getting the answers for security

102
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:37,409
questions in other means and want to

103
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,800
know as all the community feels about

104
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:43,560
this feature and as we see the reactions

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,539
were quite enthused most of the Google

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,639
search results involved - how to disable

107
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:54,030
the security questions so far we covered

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,590
what is this new feature but as security

109
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,008
researchers we want to know whether

110
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,169
there are any security implications does

111
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,690
this new feature introduced new attack

112
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,780
surface and we divided this relation to

113
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,479
- the first side whether security

114
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,400
questions can be used as a means to gain

115
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,500
access to a system or escalate

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,719
privileges and of course they are you

117
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,669
can do brute force attacks in social

118
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:20,520
engineering but this topic was widely

119
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,889
covered in the past what we want to talk

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,870
about today is whether security

121
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:29,330
questions can be used as a stealthy

122
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:32,940
backdoor I would such a scenario go an

123
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,560
attacker after already obtaining of

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,370
privileged credentials in the network

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,610
can remotely set the questions and

126
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,060
answers of all Windows 10 machine in

127
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,940
domain it can decide that everyone's dog

128
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,069
named fluffy and from that point on

129
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,860
whenever he wants to regain access to

130
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,810
any machine it just needs to be able to

131
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,270
answer correctly on the security

132
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,060
questions the answer will be fluffy and

133
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,120
as we just saw this currently not

134
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:07,349
auditing in any way and generally

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,779
speaking the this method is a persistent

136
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:13,259
method and many of the innovation

137
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:15,539
innocent is shifted from how to obtain

138
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,240
our privilege caller answers to how to

139
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,550
keep persistence in a network even after

140
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,590
you getting detected and making sure

141
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,020
that no matter what happens we will be

142
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,818
able to regain your access into a

143
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:32,068
network and this is the topic of our

144
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:34,469
talk today I would such as an Arabic

145
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,589
possible how an attacker could set

146
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,870
everyone's dog's name to be fluffy you

147
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,699
will be need to eat

148
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,060
to be able to do the following things

149
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:46,310
you want to be able to reset security

150
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,250
questions remotely and to be able to

151
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,520
reset the password remotely and lastly

152
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,340
change back what he did in order to go

153
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,240
unnoticed so what do you think can be

154
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:02,690
done I let my girl answer that thank you

155
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,500
John so the quick answer is yes it can

156
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,660
be done that's why we have it might be

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,550
the place for a disclaimer what we are

158
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,889
about to walk through is not per se an

159
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,840
exploit but rather than abused of

160
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,110
mechanism in ways that the designer

161
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,900
probably did not intend so let's review

162
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,760
our roadmap in order to use security

163
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,169
questions at a stealthy back though we

164
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,719
need to prove that we can do three

165
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,880
things set security questions remotely

166
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,010
reset the password with the questions

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,710
we've just settled and then revert the

168
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,539
password back to what it was let's start

169
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,239
with how to set security questions

170
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,430
remotely so as Don mentioned earlier

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
security questions are implemented in

172
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:47,120
the LSA secrets mechanism FSA secrets is

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,910
a safe storage mechanism in Windows it

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,530
is based on the registry and it stores

175
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,900
all kinds of things like machine

176
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:58,969
password and DP API keys and all sorts

177
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:01,310
of stuff and if you wanna access LSA

178
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:04,160
secrets LS a secret so basically each

179
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,280
secret is a registry key in which you

180
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,979
have protected binary data and there is

181
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,190
an API to access LSA secrets which

182
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:15,229
allows you to set open create Rid it's

183
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,030
pretty much like the API for working

184
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,889
with files on Windows only that here

185
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,770
behind the scenes when you perform a

186
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,320
write operation then the OS is going to

187
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,210
encrypt the data and store it encrypted

188
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,520
and when you perform a read operation

189
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,260
and then the OS is going to decrypt it

190
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,059
for you now it is encrypted in AES and

191
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,110
the encryption scheme is quite complex

192
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:42,109
but the important issue it's not an

193
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,020
issue the important thing to understand

194
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,720
about how it is encrypted is that in

195
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,020
order to assemble the AES key with which

196
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,720
the security LSA secrets are encrypted

197
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,060
you need to

198
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,460
collect artifacts from the registry on

199
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,099
that machine some of them saw the

200
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,040
manipulate them in several ways and from

201
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,410
this data you can recreate the key with

202
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,800
which those secrets are encrypted so if

203
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,360
you have full access to the registry of

204
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,969
the machine it's really not that

205
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,560
difficult to create to get the key with

206
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:20,740
which you can read and write I will say

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,270
secrets now there is another problem in

208
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,460
order to access those part of the

209
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,010
registry you would need to have system

210
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,230
account and that's a problem because

211
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,000
what we want to do is access the secrets

212
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,010
remotely and we can do that with the

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,500
system account luckily our

214
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,870
administrative user does have the

215
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,760
permission to change ACLs so we can't

216
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,290
read and write what we have the ability

217
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,290
to give us of the permissions to read

218
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,520
and write which is quite convenient and

219
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:49,030
we were looking for ways to implement

220
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,400
that and we found three ways we found

221
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,740
one way one thing we could do is dump

222
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,199
the security key to the disk using

223
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,430
administrative backup privileges but

224
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,090
that's not good enough for us because

225
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,760
that's just for reading the secrets and

226
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,440
so changing ACLs we found reg ini which

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,100
is a utility that allows you for very

228
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,660
crude changes of ACLs word of advice

229
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,920
will play don't test it on your own

230
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,949
machine from experience and eventually

231
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,990
we came to an hour to an hour PC which

232
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,390
allows you for precise modification of

233
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,120
HCl so we can take the target machine

234
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,620
and give our user the exact emissions in

235
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,820
the registry that we need in order to

236
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,800
perform this act so now enough about

237
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,380
Alice's secret in general we take a look

238
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,439
at the security questions Alice a secret

239
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,420
we see that the plaintext data is just a

240
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,480
JSON with three questions and three

241
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,250
answers not so many limitations by the

242
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,650
way on length and stuff like that you

243
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,410
can input empty strings as questions as

244
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,770
you can see on this example and if you

245
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,790
want to locate the secret then you do it

246
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:59,350
you find the registry key by the format

247
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,520
by your name L which stands for local

248
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,900
ask USA which we suppose we assume

249
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,980
stands for security question security

250
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,019
answers

251
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,910
the gooood of the user to whom the

252
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:15,040
security questions belong so if I were

253
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,569
to change security questions on a remote

254
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,699
machine I will have to do the following

255
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,110
first I will have to create a JSON with

256
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,230
the questions and answers I want a

257
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,810
planter then I would have to use the RPC

258
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,459
I've described to give myself permission

259
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,160
to read and write the part of the

260
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,768
registry I need to have access to by

261
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,510
using this access I would collect the

262
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,100
artifacts from the registry with which I

263
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,160
can create the AES key

264
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,709
then I could decrypt my own JSON and

265
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,079
then write it to the remote machine in

266
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,119
the right name format and by doing that

267
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,170
I can change security questions and

268
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,820
answers on a remote machine which takes

269
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,560
me to the next spot let's say I've

270
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,029
already done that let's say I know the

271
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,790
security questions and answers on a

272
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:03,160
remote machine can I use them remotely

273
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:06,250
to change the password so if you

274
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,319
remember we accessed the reset password

275
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,959
button from win logon screen how do I

276
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,339
get remote access to win logon screen by

277
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,170
RDP but few years back when you would do

278
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,490
a DP'd you would get this screen the

279
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,870
window gone screen of the remote machine

280
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,230
through which you can reset the password

281
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,440
but nowadays you get this prompt which

282
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,910
asks for the credentials in advance and

283
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,279
if you look at it closely you will not

284
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,899
see any reset password button over there

285
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,390
and that's a problem for us

286
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:37,810
so we were thinking what what is that

287
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:41,310
how do we go back to this and this is

288
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,199
Annaleigh it is the latest of several

289
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,140
protection upgrades that the LDP

290
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:50,140
mechanism received over the years our DP

291
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:55,029
is pretty old it's it was born in 1998

292
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:59,110
and in 2007 with Windows Vista Microsoft

293
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:01,240
introduced NLA which allows for

294
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,120
authentication of both the LDP client

295
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,430
and the server in advance and it's

296
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,160
really bad for us because NLA does not

297
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,560
allow you to reset password remotely

298
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,870
luckily in the negotiation phase of LDP

299
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,959
as an RDP client you can specify that

300
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,519
you do not support NLA by saying you do

301
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,660
not support credit sphere which is the

302
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,230
provider which

303
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,610
annaleigh and thus ask the server to

304
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,410
give you back the old window GaN

305
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,880
strength to which you can visit password

306
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,130
remotely by the way nla can be enforced

307
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,140
on a machine but earlier on when we

308
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,880
planted the security questions we had

309
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,760
access to the registry and we could

310
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,120
change a single registry value to remove

311
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:47,740
the enforcement so the quickest way for

312
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,010
us to do a POC of this interruption of

313
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,900
the negotiation is to add a create an

314
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,230
RDP file which connects to the target

315
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,930
and add a parameter saying enable

316
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,230
credits SP support false we do not

317
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,449
support creative SP and by exit by

318
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:08,050
running this RDP file we are going to

319
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,610
get the remote mean logon screen which

320
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,709
allows us to do a reset password

321
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,710
operation remotely now the last phase is

322
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,140
we just change the user's password and

323
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,330
we don't know what it was before we

324
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,890
changed it and if the user is active

325
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,000
someone is going to try to use it and

326
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,890
notice that the password has been

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,190
changed we're going to change it back

328
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,350
now can you do an undo ctrl Z to a

329
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,720
password reset password change operation

330
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,830
windows so turns out it's pretty simple

331
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,770
luckily in order to prevent people from

332
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:45,610
reusing the passwords windows stores

333
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,500
historic ntlm hashes of passwords that

334
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,710
were used on the machine now they are

335
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,420
stowed protected again in a s in the

336
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,400
registry but just like with other safe

337
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,709
secrets if you have access to the

338
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,930
registry it's not that hard to read them

339
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,180
now once you have the ntlm hash of the

340
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,760
password that you just overwritten you

341
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,430
can use an undocumented API Sam set

342
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,370
information user and reinstate the ntlm

343
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,349
hash that was active just before you

344
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:13,330
changed it and set it as the active

345
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,490
until a match effectively undoing the

346
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,950
password change so no one is going to

347
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,290
notice that and you can implement it

348
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:24,280
with women cats with simple to command

349
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:26,170
and so that's it that was a last phase

350
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,010
now let's show a demo of how the old

351
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,010
flow works

352
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:42,829
what you're playing okay so this is our

353
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,839
set up to the left we have the screen of

354
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:47,059
the attacker to the right we have the

355
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,179
target the target is of course a Windows

356
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:52,399
10 machine with the latest version so

357
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:54,529
now what we see is how the target

358
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,929
changes his security questions and then

359
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,129
uses them to reset his password it's not

360
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:00,220
part of the attack it's just a

361
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:04,189
demonstration to see the regular flow

362
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,309
now he's going to input his answers for

363
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:10,610
the security questions and he can reset

364
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:13,339
his password now if you take a look at

365
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,199
the attacker then the attacker is going

366
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,119
to change those security questions and

367
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,769
answers' remotely he's going to do it

368
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:21,230
using a Python script we wrote for the

369
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,089
POC and it's Python script does several

370
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,429
things that we've mentioned earlier it's

371
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:29,299
going to change ACLs on the remote

372
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:32,329
machine and then we create registry the

373
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:34,549
Katori the AES key with which the other

374
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:36,919
state secrets are being encrypted on

375
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:38,600
this machine and then it's going to

376
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,919
encrypt this JSON we have prepared and

377
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,629
write it to the remote machine

378
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,519
effectively changing the security

379
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:44,869
questions an answer on that machine if

380
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,730
you take a look at the JSON it's the

381
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,679
same JSON we saw before you can try and

382
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,929
guess what those are squirrel's of

383
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:56,379
unicode represent and we're going to see

384
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:59,059
it in a bit now let's execute the code

385
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:01,160
all of those phases take place and

386
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,929
that's it the QT questions have been an

387
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,860
answers have been changed on the target

388
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,720
now

389
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,659
we are going to use those security

390
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,230
questions and answers to reset the

391
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:14,059
password we already prepared an RDP file

392
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,559
that does not support network level

393
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:20,240
authentication so we can do it remotely

394
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:26,740
and by using yes we get remote access to

395
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:29,149
the window GaN screen off the target now

396
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,850
let's see have the questions been

397
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:33,678
changed yes they have now those Unicode

398
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,449
squirrels were emojis it was Tom's great

399
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,070
passion throughout the project to find a

400
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,500
way to use emojis in the security

401
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,240
questions and of course the answers are

402
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,550
all fluffy

403
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:56,310
and that's it we can reset the password

404
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:58,530
on the remote machine we skipped thank

405
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:03,030
you we skip the last part we got it

406
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,980
pretty simple and okay so we have shown

407
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,360
how you can use security questions as a

408
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,120
stealthy back though

409
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,919
not audited and for everlasting which

410
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,629
you can spread quite easily without

411
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,040
executing your own code on remote

412
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,990
machines in the entire domain and thus

413
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,060
changing everybody's dogs to be fluffy

414
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,420
forever and now I'm going to pass the

415
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,970
mic back to Tom thank you so my girls

416
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,860
said that Modi's was my where my passion

417
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,360
my God's passion was the name fluffy

418
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,580
which this thing is a pretty cool name

419
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,800
and when you expect from the guy that

420
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,600
came up with the title when everybody's

421
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,050
dog named fluffy will name his own dog

422
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,240
fluffy

423
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,950
well apparently named it Roland but we

424
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,630
use this picture during the the slides

425
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:47,550
so both me Miguel are security

426
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,620
researchers and will look at things from

427
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:53,399
a defensive perspective and wasn't very

428
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,830
important to us to to understand out the

429
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,530
risk of this new feature could be

430
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,570
minimized and want to share with you

431
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,180
what our our recommendation are to

432
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:07,740
minimize that risk and divided you into

433
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:11,370
two the first part involves Windows we

434
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:15,630
believe that it will important to add

435
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:18,239
additional auditing and GPO settings to

436
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,740
enable better monitor of security

437
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,560
questions something that is currently

438
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,290
lacking the second thing is we believe

439
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,280
it will make sense to enable an opt-out

440
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:31,649
quash option from the security questions

441
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,389
specifically on Windows Enterprise such

442
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,940
a feature makes sense for the on

443
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,340
consumer I would like my mother to have

444
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,560
the ability to reset her password in

445
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,480
case you forget it but when we talk on

446
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,940
an enterprise environment it makes when

447
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,150
you have dedicated teams to manage users

448
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,720
it makes less sense to enable such such

449
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,020
a feature and lastly if you decide to

450
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,020
implement a

451
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,389
security question feature in 2018 at

452
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,090
least enable the ability users that will

453
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,700
to customize their own questions so it

454
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,959
make much more difficult to social

455
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,740
engineer or maybe brute force the

456
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,870
answers the other side of our

457
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,630
accommodation involve security teams

458
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,500
people like us what we can do when we go

459
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:20,680
back home so the first recommendation is

460
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,560
minimize the usage of local user that

461
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,440
attack involved utilizing a local user

462
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,560
and reset its password and generally

463
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,110
local users are less audited which makes

464
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:36,190
them a more prime target for attackers

465
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:39,090
and so we advise to minimize any usage

466
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,280
of local users in an enterprise network

467
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,850
second thing is to monitor the reset

468
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,370
password event and also audit any ACL

469
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,159
changes on the security question I've

470
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,709
both steps that we had to take during

471
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,580
our attack and if they will be monitored

472
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,800
they will raise a red flag on time the

473
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,550
third recommendation which we believe is

474
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:07,210
the most efficient one is to enforce NLA

475
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,909
in your network as we just saw we were

476
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,250
able to bypass in LA by setting a

477
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,890
specific flag there is a GPO that

478
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,570
enforced an LA in the enterprise it's

479
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,340
quite a simple one and it is a very

480
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,470
effective one because it prevents the

481
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,189
entire attack an attacker will not be

482
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,720
able to reset passwords remotely and

483
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,850
lastly because we did not find any

484
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,640
built-in option for administrators to

485
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,770
set audit or disable the security

486
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,600
question we created our own powerful

487
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,400
script that we published on on our

488
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,659
github page and you're more than welcome

489
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,720
to check it out so let's review

490
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,420
everything we covered so far record a

491
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,080
new usability feature that raises some

492
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,060
serious security questions we showed how

493
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,820
this feature could be utilized by

494
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,750
attackers to create a stealthy back door

495
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,429
and keep persistence on a network and

496
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:03,190
lastly we share with you what are our

497
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:06,340
recommendations that can minimize the

498
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,650
risk of this new usability feature

499
