1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
due to technical difficulties we are

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,589
joining the program already in progress

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:12,990
let's see how smartphones are pervasive

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:16,948
in power so how did you arrived here so

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:21,119
let me have a guess somebody arrived by

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,550
flight so they in order to get to the

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,349
play they have to checking online with

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,150
their own up on their own smartphone and

9
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,159
you are able to check in online you are

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,550
able to download your boarding pass so

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,699
you don't need to print it out anymore

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,339
but maybe you came here by train and

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,050
even for the train you have a knot which

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,530
tells you about the schedule of the

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,769
train or any other news related to your

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,010
this means of transport and if you came

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,610
here by bus there are bus companies that

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,420
provide an application for you and you

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,830
where the bus is right now and maybe if

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,659
you are going to catch it or not or ride

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,380
in a cab you don't have to call the cab

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,570
anymore you just need to book it via the

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,360
application and you can see the wireless

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,949
the driver and when he is going to pick

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,869
you up or you came here by car and even

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,509
with a car you have some application

27
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,729
that tells you how something about the

28
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,110
traffic and if there are some speed

29
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,689
checker maybe you are you live nearby

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,390
here and you can buy food and no app for

31
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,600
that sorry so you have to wear on your

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,210
goods you have to use the old fashioned

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,839
paper map but just kidding there is

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:50,789
enough even for that google map and city

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,670
map so these are not provide

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,300
enough think about what you do what did

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,420
you do while you were traveling you may

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,610
post some content on Facebook you may

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,770
read some news from your favorite

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,039
newspaper you may have listened to the

41
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,649
music watch the video ma Taunton but not

42
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,079
only that you may have a phone with your

43
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,090
a call with your friend check my

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,870
calendar have a selfie basically you can

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:22,940
do an infinite amount of actions with

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,010
your phone but then this is not enough

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,850
since my phone became more and more

48
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,910
powerful you are able to streaming watch

49
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,100
some video while streaming and even

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,880
streaming your own life by a snapshot

51
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,040
and these kind of apps are able to drain

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,670
your battery in a matter of hours

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,329
because of the high energy consumption

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:52,290
but not only that you even have porting

55
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,540
of consoles gained on your phone and

56
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,690
even augmented reality games like

57
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,090
Pokemon go and as a personal experience

58
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,700
you will not be able to last one day

59
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:08,370
play that kind of game with your battery

60
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,149
you need to recharge so because marfan

61
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,180
are pervasive

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,840
and that they let you connect will with

63
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,600
all the world there are some people that

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,170
really suffers if they don't have their

65
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,370
own phone with them and there are some

66
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:29,250
studies that showed how people is able

67
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,530
to take a look at their own phone for

68
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,799
more than 80 times per day so this is a

69
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,739
sort of addiction and try to guess if

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,620
some of this kind of person did ever

71
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,810
charge their phone during the night what

72
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,910
happened the day after when they don't

73
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,160
they are running out of battery and they

74
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:53,329
are not able to recharge it that's panic

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:57,420
right so let's think about our

76
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,600
priorities what was about two years ago

77
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,450
or even five years ago we were

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,680
constantly looking for a place to

79
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,369
connect to the internet

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,739
with our phone so we were going to

81
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,950
Starbucks and on some other place with

82
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,930
free Wi-Fi in order to get connected but

83
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,009
now it's not like this anymore because

84
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:23,759
there are free internet hotspot but also

85
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:26,460
the mobile carrier companies they

86
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,720
provide you with the subscription that

87
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,650
are quite good they offer you a gigabyte

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,850
of Internet traffic for a fair price so

89
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:42,330
right now the priority is not to find

90
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,610
somewhere to connect but if founds is to

91
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,520
find somewhere to recharge the battery

92
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,760
of your phone right and when there is

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,510
this kind of demand the market responds

94
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:58,020
and how the market responds you are able

95
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:01,639
to see some device like this even here

96
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:06,090
at the entrance of this conference

97
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:09,750
facility but also in jeans in moles

98
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,388
train station Airport you are able to go

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,099
there you put your phone there you plug

100
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,280
in the cable you leave the phone there

101
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:21,150
and you go out and while the former

102
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,609
charges but not only this maybe your

103
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,750
hotel room you are able to find a USB

104
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:31,530
port attached to the old-fashioned power

105
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,080
socket and this can be found even in the

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,760
airport but also on the buses now and

107
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,240
trains but if this is not enough you

108
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,599
have the power banks and think about it

109
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,320
is a bigger battery to recharge your

110
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:52,020
battery okay it's quite funny and in

111
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,599
China you can rent your own power bank

112
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,090
there are this kind of device here that

113
00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:00,000
there are very popular engines you go

114
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,250
there you scan your QR code you pay an

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,830
amount of money you get your power bank

116
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,150
and when you finish to use it you put it

117
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:13,200
back so now we have places to recharge

118
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:17,310
our old phone but then this is

119
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,530
interesting for our cars and what we

120
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,479
witnessed

121
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:26,250
recent years are many attacks that at

122
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,949
exfiltrate information from your phone

123
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,500
they install malware on your phone while

124
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:35,849
you are in charging it because of

125
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,800
something unprotected you have just your

126
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,620
cable you plug in but you don't know

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,849
anything about the USB port that you are

128
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:48,449
using and this attacks are popular for

129
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:51,810
Android iPhone and Windows Phone but and

130
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:55,199
and go on and go on and particular this

131
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,370
attack is quite interesting since when

132
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,020
you connect your phone

133
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,699
it turns the USB cable thanks to a

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,120
functionality of the phone it has the

135
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,129
USB cable into a BGA cable so when you

136
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,110
plug your phone that actor the attacker

137
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,210
is able to see exactly what you are

138
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:16,310
doing with your phone and this kind of

139
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:24,659
attack is called Jewish filming attack

140
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:27,479
so what is in common among these attacks

141
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:32,400
is that they use the data transfer

142
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:38,008
connection so this is atom of a USB port

143
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:41,489
okay we have four pins two pins are used

144
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:44,610
for the power to give power to your

145
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,349
device and two other pins are used for

146
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:51,150
the data for the serial connection so

147
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:55,080
some countermeasure that are in place

148
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,020
now uses this is a software contour

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,810
measure for example by Android so when

150
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,628
you plug your phone into a USB port you

151
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,229
are not transmitting data by default but

152
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,400
you are in a charged only mode so

153
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,940
hopefully your data will not be

154
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:18,029
transferred but if this is not enough

155
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:21,120
for you to be quite sure about your data

156
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:24,589
to not get exfiltrated you even have

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:31,420
this kind of devices that they cut off

158
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:34,450
to pings and only allowing the power pin

159
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,340
and this device can be found on Amazon

160
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:42,730
and there are the cable one and also the

161
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,790
dongle one for example this one and do

162
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:48,670
you know how they called it they are

163
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,980
called USB condoms because they prevent

164
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,140
you from unknown one and not wanted

165
00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:00,160
infections okay

166
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:02,860
so after all this countermeasure there

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,189
is also the another one which is using

168
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,670
your own power bank okay so hopefully

169
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:15,070
you will not get your data exfiltrated

170
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:19,089
but this is enough so no because instead

171
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:22,090
I would not be here right and but before

172
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,590
to get it entering the core of this kind

173
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,690
of attack we need some background

174
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:29,920
knowledge about how the smartphone

175
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:33,010
recharge the battery ok so from this

176
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,060
plot you can see the charge capacity of

177
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:40,870
the battery in the sorry in the right

178
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:44,349
y-axis and as you can see the battery

179
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,960
recharged over time and then we start

180
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,140
increasing with a higher rate at the

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,960
beginning and then still increasing but

182
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,490
with a lower rate let's see what

183
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:01,630
happened to the voltage of our battery

184
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:05,650
start to increase very fast very rapidly

185
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:11,290
now but then less rapidly until it got

186
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:13,900
constant for the wall that for the rest

187
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:18,099
of the charging but what is interesting

188
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:20,920
here is the current so this is the

189
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,420
maximum current that the power supply is

190
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,240
able to provide and at the beginning the

191
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,069
battle has absorbed all the power that

192
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
is provided but after some time

193
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:36,460
precisely when the voltage start to

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,090
became constant they start to drop down

195
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:45,530
slowly till we reach at zero okay but

196
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,470
still the power supply

197
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:52,970
you still be able to give you this

198
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,400
amount of battery of power but is not

199
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,420
used because the battery works it works

200
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,930
in that way

201
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:04,969
so if this amount goes to the battery

202
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:07,280
what about the rest maybe it can be used

203
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,250
by the smartphone in order to work while

204
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,160
the battery is charging so in order to

205
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,880
verify this we have to do a little bit

206
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,360
of experiment right so we have our

207
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,000
smartphone here with a low battery and

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,010
then we connect the smartphone through

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,410
this kind of device this kind of device

210
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,050
is called moon zoom power meter and is

211
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,770
able to measure the current that is

212
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:37,160
provided to a smartphone then this is

213
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,829
the output port but this is the input

214
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:44,060
port that is connected to a power source

215
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:46,520
that can be our USB adapter and this

216
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,099
kind of tool is able to measure all the

217
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:53,840
current that is flowing through this

218
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:58,100
which is a sort of bridge so first

219
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:01,820
experiment as expected with a low

220
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,820
battery we have a constant current so

221
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,580
all the current provided by the power

222
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,380
supply goes directly to the smartphone

223
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,340
battery okay

224
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:17,080
but then when the battery charge start

225
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:20,960
to raise reaching the 50% we don't have

226
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,450
any more the current here but is going

227
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:28,360
down and now we can see a little bit of

228
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:31,970
noise right let's investigate more

229
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:35,180
we know that the display consumed a lot

230
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,970
of battery right and especially the

231
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,250
brightness but let's try to do an

232
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,950
experiment so let's turn the display on

233
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,440
and off and let's see what happened as

234
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:48,080
we can see when the display is off we

235
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,570
have a display at this level of energy

236
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,170
consumption in terms of current but when

237
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,780
I turn on the display I can see a peak

238
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,110
and then when I turn the display off

239
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,110
again

240
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:09,020
I see the original amount of current

241
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:13,579
provided we are almost there so what

242
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:17,569
about CPU burst when a CPU works in an

243
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,400
intense intense fashion so let's write

244
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,010
our own application very simple

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,850
application we declare the duration of a

246
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,600
burst which is one second and then we

247
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:33,290
let everything into a while loop and at

248
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:37,760
the beginning the CPU will sleep but

249
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:40,550
then the CPU is forced to increase a

250
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,010
dummy counter for the whole duration of

251
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:47,060
the burst thanks to another while loop

252
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:55,400
and when the there is the timestamp for

253
00:13:47,060 --> 00:14:00,770
the birth to end the burst will hand and

254
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:03,520
what happened here is the result we were

255
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:07,610
able to see that when the CPU is idle

256
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:12,410
we have no burst and so we have flat

257
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:16,910
current sorry and when we have the CPU

258
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:20,600
burst we have the increasing of an

259
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:24,050
energy consumption and thus current

260
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,920
absorbed so at this point did you have

261
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,719
my same idea how can we use this so

262
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,300
imagine that we have to transmit a

263
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:40,070
string classic binary code 0 for a birth

264
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:44,329
and nothing for one and then we modify

265
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:46,310
our simple code in order to do that so

266
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,420
if we have a deal we do the same as

267
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:54,699
before if we have a 1 we just let the

268
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,349
CPU sleep and this is what we have and

269
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,530
we are able to recognize when there is a

270
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,980
burst and where there is not so we are

271
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:08,380
able to decode it and get off the binary

272
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:11,000
information so you just see what we did

273
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,590
we start with a smart phone and we turn

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,160
our smart phone into

275
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,920
this and for those of you that are too

276
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,449
young to know maybe all of us is a

277
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:28,459
telegraph okay line that line dot but it

278
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:31,520
works with the CPU burst so let's talk

279
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,590
about this kind of covered channel what

280
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,410
we're able to control and what we are

281
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:39,890
not able to control because think about

282
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:45,050
it this was not meant to be there for us

283
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:48,290
to use so right now we are not able to

284
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:51,770
control the intensity of a burst we just

285
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:55,630
know the birth and not so we cannot

286
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:59,410
control the energy consumption and it'll

287
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:04,040
but what we can control is the timing

288
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,829
but not very precisely since this

289
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,020
channel is not very reactive every time

290
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:12,560
that they start a burst it takes a

291
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:16,189
little while in order to reach the top

292
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,250
and then when I stop the burst it takes

293
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:22,130
a little while to go down again that's

294
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:26,240
why we cannot push it too far in terms

295
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:29,630
of in terms of data transfer rate but

296
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:34,250
let's see what we can do now let me

297
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:38,210
present to Bob Bob as a secret on his

298
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:41,600
smart phone for example a file with all

299
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:44,690
his password or bank accounts or maybe

300
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,850
the number of Donald Trump in his

301
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,330
contact list and he doesn't want to

302
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,210
share with everybody so Bob is quite

303
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,790
paranoid and it does he doesn't allow

304
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,510
any application to access to the

305
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,329
Internet

306
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:04,520
just in case do not get his secret

307
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:06,470
stolen and then why he stolen up he

308
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:13,040
always double-checked the permission

309
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:15,880
that that requires and then since he has

310
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,859
a smartphone and the battery may run low

311
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,700
he always brings with himself a USB

312
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,889
condom and when it charges his phone he

313
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,350
holy use a usb come to me because he

314
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,200
knows about the profit

315
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,678
see and security risk of public charging

316
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,870
station so Bob cares about his privacy

317
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:39,820
so everybody be like Bob but at the

318
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,270
other side of the cable there is Mark

319
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:47,409
and mark knows that bob has a secret and

320
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:50,080
he wants to know that secret and somehow

321
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:54,429
mark was able to install an application

322
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,799
inside Bob phone but mark knows that he

323
00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:02,260
cannot rely on internet because of Bob

324
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,840
paranoid so but mark is really motivated

325
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:09,390
to exfiltrate that kind of information

326
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:13,090
so how can mark do this kind of attack

327
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:16,450
this is at action area there is Bob with

328
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:19,750
this phone and we have our powers in

329
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:23,350
each up which are we were we will talk

330
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:26,230
about later in detail and the haptic as

331
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,689
I input the password and is ready to

332
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,500
transmit with the covered channel that I

333
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,720
show you before and Bob want to recharge

334
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,710
this phone connect this phone to the

335
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,370
power supply

336
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:43,390
which is which is controlled by Mark and

337
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:46,510
just to be sure you just turn all the

338
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,809
Wi-Fi capabilities off with the flight

339
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:55,150
mode or just switch them off and using a

340
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:57,399
USB condom then Bob since the smartphone

341
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,260
is going to take a while recharge you

342
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:06,250
just go away and having a nap or just

343
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,600
some shopping and in the meanwhile tends

344
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,990
to hover covered channel

345
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,049
the information is exfiltrated to the

346
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,520
and the energy consumption can be

347
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:18,908
measured at the other side of the cable

348
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,200
and from the measurement we can decode

349
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:25,929
the information back and give it to mark

350
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,710
so let's check our application our

351
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:32,620
application takes the information it

352
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:37,540
encodes the information sterilizing it

353
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:40,030
so 0 1 0 1 etc and if we want some more

354
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:44,500
about transmission we can also add

355
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:48,190
crc or error correction code name it and

356
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,560
then we wait for the cable to be

357
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,530
connected because instead no cable no

358
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:59,649
transmission right and when it's

359
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:02,470
connected and there are the ideal there

360
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,110
are the ideal condition to transmit it

361
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:10,900
just keep generating bursts according to

362
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:13,990
the encoded payload how this application

363
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,830
work and what this application requires

364
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:21,550
so this is our prototype we just input

365
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:24,699
the payload here we can encode a string

366
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,970
that we just input using an ASCII code

367
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,750
okay and then we can start and stop the

368
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:37,180
transmission and when it is mission

369
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:40,870
start to go out we can say also the data

370
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:43,270
ring transfer what is interesting is

371
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:46,870
that this application only needs two

372
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,610
kind of permission okay actually it

373
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,620
needs the permission to access the

374
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,840
information we want to actuator because

375
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,739
instead we will not be able to to get it

376
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,720
right but plus only require two

377
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,750
permission which are not considered

378
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,090
dangerous for the privacy which is the

379
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,460
wakelock permission and the battery

380
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,040
manager permission just to know when the

381
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,500
cable is connected or not and they wake

382
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,520
up wake lock permission in order to wake

383
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,590
up the phone while it is in standby and

384
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:22,680
of course it doesn't mean doesn't use

385
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:25,929
internet access how the decoder works so

386
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,710
since we can see our energy consumption

387
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:32,290
as a signal we can apply signal

388
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,420
processing using radio and let me go

389
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,639
through step by step on the decoder

390
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:40,290
let's start with the first one and now

391
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm killing too long so this is our

392
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:48,190
signal which is a natural signal for my

393
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,650
real phone and we have a synchronization

394
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,740
preamble in order to let the power

395
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:57,160
supply know the

396
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:00,370
the timing of each bit and then we have

397
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,640
uh not return to zero encoding which is

398
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:07,719
quite robust and we can see the burst

399
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,330
and the not burst but first thanks to

400
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,350
the to this preamble we are able to

401
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:16,418
divide the transmission by the bits and

402
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:20,620
then we are able to recognize whether a

403
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:21,880
bit is a 0 or a 1 and after that we can

404
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,449
divide it to bytes

405
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:29,679
since we use an ASCII code and then

406
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:34,240
blackout and we are able to get our

407
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,580
message back ok

408
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,870
this is a this application is not very

409
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,820
smart right now right it just does meet

410
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:47,020
no matter the condition so it's just

411
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:50,950
like a blind Rambo and very noisy and it

412
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:53,770
can be detected right so let's be smart

413
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,600
and let's be more precise and more

414
00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:01,389
silent so as I told you before we don't

415
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,110
need no special permission but the one

416
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:10,140
to access the data we want to exfiltrate

417
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:15,939
no internet permission and even if some

418
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:18,460
battery saving method as is in place the

419
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,409
battery saving method doesn't work when

420
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,289
the battery the charges because there is

421
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:27,220
no battery to save and then even those

422
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:31,450
mode on android is not affecting our

423
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,330
method which is good and then how our

424
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,549
application can be deployed may be could

425
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,699
be some apparently innocuous application

426
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:42,370
for example a fancy alarm clock that can

427
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,250
wake you up with your own music but to

428
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:49,780
access the music yet - it has to access

429
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:52,179
to your files right or can be a popular

430
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,950
package up for third part market

431
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:59,080
markets but then you may wonder ok the

432
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,890
display consume a lot of energy so why

433
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:06,550
did we then use the display but come on

434
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:09,760
if we want to let the display consume we

435
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:13,120
to turn it off and the victim will

436
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,370
notice his phone flashing so it's better

437
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,750
to be the CPU burst which are not easily

438
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:21,189
to be detected but we have to be careful

439
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,240
they can because they can still be

440
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:30,180
detected how we must to have the screen

441
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:33,430
off so the user cannot experience on

442
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:36,460
some degradation of the user experience

443
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:40,060
because of CPU is running in the

444
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:43,810
background right and then Android debug

445
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,510
bridge is able to let you monitor the

446
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:49,210
resources of your phone so if you have

447
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,450
done right the bug bridge active you can

448
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,820
see the CPU burst and we don't want to

449
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:58,870
to let the victim know about it so when

450
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,159
they see the ADB is active we just keep

451
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,729
silent right

452
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,710
and then because of the cost and initial

453
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,080
cost and current we are not able to

454
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:11,040
transmit because we are not able to to

455
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,199
observe the CPU burst so we have to wait

456
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:19,030
smartly until the battery is above a

457
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:22,810
certain level of charge but of course I

458
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:25,050
don't want our application to transmit

459
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:28,389
every time the phone is connected

460
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,990
because if nobody is listening there is

461
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,990
no way

462
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:37,600
there's no mean for the transmission but

463
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,760
the power supply can let the application

464
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,679
know whether he is listening or not and

465
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,320
using the battery manager permission you

466
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,250
can the battery supply these are the

467
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:55,510
power supply can variate the current in

468
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:58,990
order to get charging to charging slowly

469
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,920
to charging again with a precise time

470
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:05,290
and so the application will know that

471
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,270
somebody is listening because the power

472
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:10,690
supply and the battery Prarie agree on

473
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:13,360
this kind of communication and then

474
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,350
since we are using only the surplus of

475
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:21,449
the current provided this kind of attack

476
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:27,129
does in effect your battery recharge

477
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:30,190
but then at this point okay mark is

478
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:34,960
motivated but not that motivated right

479
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:37,810
and this tool is an excellent tool that

480
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,420
is quite costly so no matter how mark is

481
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:46,679
motivated and rich is not willing to

482
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:51,790
deploy for each cable power monitor so

483
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,920
how to make mark happy we want this

484
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,159
device to measure the electric energy

485
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:02,470
consumption to be cheaper smaller and

486
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:05,830
easy to be deployed and how electronic

487
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:09,910
by ourselves so we have to take a PCB

488
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:13,840
board and something we want is that all

489
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:16,960
this circuit here has to work with the

490
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,939
normal energy that is provided to a

491
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,680
smartphone which is 5 volt here and then

492
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,360
we want to measure the current so we

493
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:32,470
have the power supply cable coming here

494
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,669
and then the smartphone cable go a

495
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,990
smartphone cable side so from here

496
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:41,950
acting like a bridge we are able to

497
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:44,920
measure the electric current how with

498
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:48,400
this kind of sensor which is a whole

499
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:52,120
effect sensor that takes the current as

500
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:56,290
an input and then gives the measurement

501
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:00,129
in output to be read by an Arduino a

502
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:03,970
simple Arduino that keep sample the

503
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:06,520
information the the current and then you

504
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,760
can transmit it outside okay

505
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:14,800
and if a Wi-Fi network is not available

506
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:17,050
you can use a GSM module and if none of

507
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,020
them is available you can simply store

508
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:23,460
the information for later to be

509
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:30,700
transmitted to mark and the size of this

510
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:33,850
is this oh but I'm pretty sure that can

511
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:38,260
be even smaller maybe with some

512
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:42,730
someone that is more practiced and so

513
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:46,060
you see we reduce the dimension and we

514
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,130
can place it inside here especially if

515
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,810
the manufacturer is willing to

516
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:54,760
exfiltrate information we can deploy in

517
00:28:51,810 --> 00:29:01,899
empower port in the world socket and

518
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:05,350
even on the power adapters okay so mark

519
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:08,920
is IP let's see how happy is it I can

520
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:13,360
find all the components on Amazon and

521
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:16,330
even if this sensor is quite good and

522
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,510
very precise my grandma doesn't allow me

523
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:23,310
to spend a lot of money so I have to go

524
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:26,860
cheaper and these kind of sensors are

525
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:29,050
cheaper than the other one but still are

526
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,939
able to measure the same amount of

527
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:35,950
current so we are happy about it and

528
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:40,210
then let's get an Arduino in a bundle of

529
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:42,250
three let's get a Wi-Fi module and even

530
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:46,030
if we are not very lucky and we have to

531
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:48,190
store the information we can use SD card

532
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:52,389
module in order to store the information

533
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:55,990
but still the price is quite cheap 17

534
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:59,760
pound which is 40 times less than the

535
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:05,640
original power meter so mark is happy

536
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:11,110
let's see it work video time video time

537
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:12,100
let me put in full screen so here is how

538
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:18,929
a beautiful app

539
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:22,469
oh that's important okay

540
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:26,830
this is my colleague using the app

541
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:28,870
switch the smartphone off we are the

542
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:32,020
Arduino connected to the serial cable

543
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:34,840
and the current sensor which is

544
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:38,080
connected to the power cable to the

545
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:43,449
power source which is the laptop now and

546
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:47,290
then we start the sampling and as we can

547
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,270
see now we have the first burst we have

548
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,440
another one

549
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,260
we have another room because this

550
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:57,669
bramble but let's skip it because what

551
00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:01,900
let's do it faster and then when the

552
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:06,940
signal is no more there we can apply

553
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:10,780
some new radio magic and analyze what we

554
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,299
just collected but what we collected is

555
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,790
in a binary format still an ASCII code

556
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:19,059
when a binary form acts in format so we

557
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:25,500
have to make it human readable and as

558
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:33,910
you can see here is our message success

559
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:37,210
so what we can learn from this talk

560
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:42,429
first of all that there is a cover

561
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:46,390
channel which we use an Android device

562
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:48,700
that uses only the energy consumption in

563
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:53,799
order to expect written information so

564
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,059
even in when USB condom is in place we

565
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,780
are still able to transmit our

566
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:02,530
information outside and then this attack

567
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:06,220
is low cost and so small that can be

568
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:09,820
deployed easily in power banks charge a

569
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:17,770
charging station or even on your USB

570
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:21,340
adapter and so far just for now the one

571
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:24,210
of the way that I can suggest you to in

572
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,590
order to not get your information

573
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:30,929
exfiltrated when you were charge your

574
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:34,928
phone just turn it off just in case okay

575
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:37,140
let me have a brief thanks for the

576
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:40,270
people involved to this project

577
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,820
especially lila buddha he and professor

578
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:44,950
rather prevent Iran from University of

579
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,309
Washington which helped us with the

580
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,390
first version of the of this attack

581
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,490
professor even Martina rich from the

582
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:54,490
University of Oxford and the other Santo

583
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:58,710
from University of Padua that helped us

584
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:01,010
with making our application as a service

585
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,520
and then

586
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:07,730
there are our universities University of

587
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,559
Padua the sprits research group Utrecht

588
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:13,309
University University of Oxford and

589
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,710
University of Washington so thank you

590
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:17,660
very much for your attention

591
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,380
if you have any question really happy to

592
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:28,700
answer them

593
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:32,390
thank you I have a question down here

594
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:35,320
and you have proof of concept on iPhones

595
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:37,010
and they can't be turned off while

596
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,220
recharging so to have any

597
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,330
recommendations for that excuse me could

598
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,530
you repeat the question please

599
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:47,449
yeah actually that was to what the first

600
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,360
one is to have a proof-of-concept

601
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,540
on iPhones and what is your

602
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,949
recommendations for iPhone since you can

603
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:00,500
turn them off while recharging oh so let

604
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,400
me repeat the question since you cannot

605
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,470
turn the iPhone off while recharging

606
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,679
what is your what is the recommendation

607
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:15,830
in order to not get data exfiltrate that

608
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:20,119
is it right yes okay so so far we look

609
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:27,230
into Android but and we didn't look into

610
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:29,570
iPhone so sorry but I'm not able to

611
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,639
answer your question but we will

612
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:35,409
definitely take a look at it in the

613
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:39,379
future thank you I have you considered

614
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:42,590
wireless charging as well yes is the

615
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:45,350
same iraq possible version to zero so

616
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:49,359
the wireless charging we take a look at

617
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:51,440
that the channel is very noisy and

618
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,149
probably that would be a good

619
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,160
countermeasure to this kind of attack

620
00:34:53,149 --> 00:35:01,880
because the wireless charging as far as

621
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,720
I was able to observe some very a very

622
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,350
high amount of energy and is not very

623
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,049
related to the battery so it is all that

624
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,270
the current is absorbed by the charger

625
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,550
and not by the phone directly

626
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:19,390
so that could be a good culture measure

627
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,770
so far thank you

628
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,900
hi I was wondering what the rates of

629
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,520
data exfiltration is like basically when

630
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,040
you doing a video it seems like that's

631
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,480
quite a long thing each spike was

632
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,570
actually quite known so the question is

633
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:40,730
which data rate we are able to achieve

634
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:44,600
so far so because of the delay from the

635
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:49,730
Edo status to the birth status we had

636
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:52,640
that kind of delay we were able to the

637
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,490
the highest data rate transmission we

638
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:00,230
had is two bits per second which is

639
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:02,600
quite low I know but this kind of

640
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:06,800
covered channel was not meant to be to

641
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:09,410
be there so but let's say you are easily

642
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,390
be able to actually if you charge the

643
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:14,350
form overnight you are usually able to

644
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:19,520
expect rate on all your contact list so

645
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:22,069
it takes like to transmit 500 bytes

646
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,270
takes like 10 minutes something like

647
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:28,550
that thank you for the question hi there

648
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:33,050
just wanted to say great presentation

649
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:37,130
and like you have um tried to work out

650
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:40,790
what smartphone apps are in usage from

651
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:43,369
the power usage could you repeat the

652
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:46,250
question please and have you tried to

653
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:52,220
work out what smartphone apps are being

654
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:54,440
used from the power usage that's a good

655
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:57,890
question and actually is something that

656
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:01,160
we thought about okay for those of you

657
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:04,160
okay I will repeat the question I will

658
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:09,680
be able to recognize that an app from

659
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:14,330
the power consumption well spoiler we

660
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:19,480
are working on that but he so far yes

661
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:23,140
but we are working right now on that

662
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,140
thank you for the question

663
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:30,080
hello hello so have you tried testing

664
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:32,420
that against something that uses more

665
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,180
proprietary type of charging such as -

666
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,500
charging which actually has constant

667
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,500
communication between the phone and the

668
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,080
charger since it's a faster form of

669
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,270
let's say welcome quick charge or so

670
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,560
since will this affect the transfer of

671
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,120
data since there's actually

672
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,330
communication already happening between

673
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:53,529
the front of the charger good question

674
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:56,690
so how about - charging quick charging

675
00:37:53,530 --> 00:38:02,060
usually this kind of charges they use

676
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:08,740
USB 3 USB C and we took a look at that

677
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:08,740
and essentially okay the USB C has more

678
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:16,370
plus for the power but they share the

679
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,550
same ground so we are still able to

680
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:21,980
measure the electric consumption and for

681
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,650
a - charge is even easier because you

682
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,620
can get your battery charged very fast

683
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:31,970
and so the current will start to drop

684
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:34,310
down earlier so if you charge it during

685
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,700
the night we are able to charge even

686
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:48,259
more information ok thank you for the

687
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:51,109
question any other question if there is

688
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:54,710
not any other question oh I was so fast

689
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:59,660
okay if there is not any other question

690
00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:02,960
on - thank you all and if you want to

691
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,069
discuss offline and I will be here thank

692
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,150
you

693
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:10,150
