8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,110
morning everyone wow this is a different

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,780
view than last year we've grown a bit

10
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,600
and we required a bigger room so this is

11
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,589
pretty cool I can paste the stage

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,580
hopefully get you thinking a little bit

13
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,740
before I introduce the keynote for those

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,400
of you who don't know me I'm Jeff Moss

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,899
I'll be your your keynote introducer and

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,550
I also had the the luck the honor of

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,400
producing and starting blackhat and to

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,310
see it grow especially in Europe to this

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,220
size it's really humbling I mean our

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,170
industry is not slowing down if anything

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,750
our industry as we'll be talking about

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,149
later we're facing more and more

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,570
challenges right at the time I think

24
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,910
we're able to deal with them so it's not

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,740
all doom and gloom it's just a lot of

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,420
hard work you know so I want to talk to

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,520
a little bit about the event and then

28
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,490
I'm gonna have some opening comments and

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,320
if you've seen me do this before I like

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,539
to talk about sort of the diversity of

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,490
people that attend blackhat and it

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,070
hasn't changed for this year we have

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,339
over a hundred and six countries

34
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,110
represented in this room so people came

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,470
from 106 different countries to hear

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,950
what's going on here and out of those

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,019
hundred and six there's a single person

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,579
that came from 26 of the countries so

39
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:21,060
there's 26 countries that only had one

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,260
person and I'm always curious on on what

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,400
countries that is so I have a little

42
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,530
list here I'm just gonna go through some

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,480
of them hopefully you find this

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,100
interesting as well we have one person

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,579
from America Samoa

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,810
I sure bye John and if you're that one

47
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,239
person while I call this out feel free

48
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:41,360
to whoop it up or raise your hand or

49
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:45,600
cheer one from Benin Cape Verde Colombia

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,370
Ethiopia Guinea and Waris Hong Kong

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,370
Iceland Lebanon Luxembourg Monaco Oman

52
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,590
Peru Puerto Rico here's one that's not

53
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,930
really a reunion technically a French

54
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,050
division but still only one person from

55
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,170
the island will give them a pass one

56
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,040
from Senegal Sierra Leone Somalia sri

57
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,950
lanka sue

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,900
Syria Thailand whose Becca Stan and one

59
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,879
from Yemen and I didn't hear one woop

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,060
maybe there none of them are here in the

61
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,209
room something we also try to do to

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,359
enlarge the pool of people in InfoSec

63
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,480
community and people who get interested

64
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,939
or try it out as we do scholarships so

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,340
blackhat can be expensive for some that

66
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,799
not not working in the field

67
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,180
professionally and so years ago we came

68
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,590
up with an idea of these scholarships

69
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,069
where you write a white paper you show

70
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,780
us some research and and if it meets a

71
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:45,619
certain standard we give you a free pass

72
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,750
and the idea is to try to bring in

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,159
continuously new fresh blood and so this

74
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,900
year the 120 scholarships were awarded

75
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,220
so it's 120 new people that probably

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,049
would not have been able to attend so if

77
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,639
any of those hundred 20 are here can you

78
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:08,790
please raise your hand for a round of

79
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:10,949
applause good job okay so if you see

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,440
those people feel free to go up and talk

81
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,560
to them and try to convince them that

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,039
this is a really good field to be in

83
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,048
not too much pressure or anything all

84
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,760
right so I like to also just make a

85
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:26,940
couple of observations before we kick

86
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,260
off with our keynote and I've been

87
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,690
really thinking about what feels

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,510
different about this year than last cuz

89
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,120
it does feel different to me and I think

90
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,699
part of it is that I feel like we've

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,960
entered almost a new like era or new

92
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,430
stage or it's new awareness and I felt

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,760
this before a couple of times one time

94
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,830
who remembers like the dot-com boom era

95
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,099
leading up to the boom and then the bust

96
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:56,310
right I mean that was a magical era we

97
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:59,280
realized that value was now at risk we

98
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,720
put everything on the internet and we

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,250
did a lot of commerce on the internet

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,270
right that was sort of the dawn of

101
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,180
e-commerce eBay Amazon started but a lot

102
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,859
of commerce and it was this sort of rush

103
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,300
to find security professionals that

104
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:17,460
could protect things online where before

105
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,750
nothing needed protecting and that

106
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,640
empowered us

107
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,640
a lot and it gave us a lot of self-worth

108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,289
gave us careers it showed that there was

109
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:33,780
value in this field and then time went

110
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:36,180
by and around 2010 who remembers when

111
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,719
Google came out publicly and said that

112
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,480
they had been hacked by the Chinese

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,040
right that was a big deal and I feel

114
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,050
that was for me that was sort of like

115
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,940
this epoch moment there's before Google

116
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,630
did that and then after Google did that

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,870
because before that I would talk to

118
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,520
people in policy or leadership and I

119
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,070
would say well you have these threats

120
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,320
and these governments and nobody

121
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,300
believed you and then you talk the IT

122
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,530
people and you talk to the managers and

123
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,850
they're like oh yeah China is all over

124
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,609
us it's a total disaster they're

125
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,630
stealing everything then you talk to

126
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,470
leadership and they're like no

127
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,310
everything's fine

128
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:16,440
nothing's on fire then Google comes out

129
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,460
speaks publicly that this is a problem

130
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,460
and it's really happening

131
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,440
and all of a sudden overnight it was

132
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,250
acceptable to talk about nation-states

133
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,680
stealing your stuff

134
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,300
I remember companies were actually I was

135
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,510
it this one executive event somewhere

136
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,270
and the CEOs were actually bragging to

137
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,969
other CEOs oh you have have you been

138
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,520
broken in by China yet no oh you must

139
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,500
must not be out important and it was

140
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,000
like they were bragging about how

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,630
critical and important they were based

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,780
on who was hacking them but that enabled

143
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,979
us to speak to a new audience so media

144
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,630
took us a little bit more seriously

145
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,599
boards took us more seriously and

146
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,310
leadership took us more seriously and

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,430
that was really a before and after event

148
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,640
and now I feel kind of feel like this is

149
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,650
happening again and it's around

150
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,860
non-traditional info sucked topics it

151
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,140
seems like we're dealing with almost

152
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,810
like great power politics have entered

153
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,030
our arena it's not just law enforcement

154
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,460
or organized crime or botnets or

155
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,929
something it feels like great powers are

156
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,450
now playing in our area right

157
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,850
nation-states with different agendas and

158
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,750
different rules are now playing in our

159
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:31,289
backyard but it's still our networks

160
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,490
they're on our systems and the things

161
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,539
that are happening are not

162
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,800
really traditional it's not so much

163
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:41,818
stealing money but it's it's like

164
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,490
election meddling it's creating fake

165
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,849
news narratives it's deep fakes it's

166
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:51,150
propaganda it's us waking up to the

167
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:54,690
risks social risks of maybe giant social

168
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,719
media platforms those none of these are

169
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,099
traditional InfoSec problems but we're

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,319
gonna be the ones getting the phone call

171
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,599
we're gonna be the ones being asked on

172
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,120
how to fix it we're gonna be asked what

173
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,880
are the risks and so we're gonna have

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,590
all of our normal responsibilities but

175
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,500
we're in a new era where we're gonna be

176
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,909
called upon to really provide advice and

177
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,919
try to fix some of these issues and I

178
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:23,330
think that's super exciting and it's

179
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,469
super scary at the same time but it's

180
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,419
definitely not like it was two years ago

181
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,000
right there is a general acceptance now

182
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,490
that we are in a different era much like

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,039
when Google made it acceptable to talk

184
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,469
about being attacked and having your

185
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,000
electril property stolen the election

186
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,779
meddling in the United States has made

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,120
it okay to talk about interference in

188
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,829
electoral processes and it's also

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,570
allowed us to talk about the harms that

190
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,819
social media platforms like Facebook can

191
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,010
potentially enable so it's a different

192
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,620
era and one of the reasons I'm really

193
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,709
optimistic though is as a community

194
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,930
we've been really growing last 10 years

195
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,939
and we've also really embraced I think a

196
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,969
certain amount of diversity I mean we

197
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,610
have a wider pool of candidates and

198
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:12,120
we've ever had more gender more

199
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,180
ethnicities more religious views and

200
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,589
these are all super important because if

201
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,020
you look at the type of problems we're

202
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,120
going to be facing these are more

203
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,390
socially oriented problems so if you're

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,160
building a platform for social pool you

205
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,569
need people from those communities to

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:34,980
inform your your UI your decisions train

207
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,470
your AR and m/l systems right so super

208
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,610
optimistic super stressed out and we're

209
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,959
all going to be in this together which

210
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,020
is exciting

211
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,199
and so to help talk about one slice of

212
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,130
this is our keynote speaker

213
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,890
rina caldron and i really I think that

214
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,900
I've turned to her and learned a lot

215
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,850
from marina I wanted to tell you a

216
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,069
little bit about her bio and then I'm

217
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,800
gonna unleash her on you

218
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:06,420
so marina served as the Estonian foreign

219
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,430
minister in 2015 and 2016 after starting

220
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,520
her career in the Ministry of Foreign

221
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,589
Affairs so she was a government employee

222
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,310
or what we call in the states of Gov II

223
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:20,730
not a political appointee but a career

224
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,589
government servant and she was part of

225
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,050
the delegation that negotiated the

226
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,450
withdrawal of Russian troops from

227
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,209
Estonia and the Estonian border region

228
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:34,350
so she's been dealing with the Russians

229
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:36,480
for quite a while and in my area that

230
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,070
technology area it's fascinating she's

231
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,750
served twice as the Estonian

232
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,390
representative to the UN group of

233
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,160
governmental experts with a focus on

234
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,319
telecommunications technology and

235
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,770
international security so that's the tie

236
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:53,370
between the technology and the national

237
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,829
security requirements of these nation

238
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,300
states of the big powers and then I've

239
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,400
known and worked with marina since the

240
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,510
she's our chairwoman for the global

241
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,829
Commission on the stability of

242
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,510
cyberspace where I serve as a

243
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,640
commissioner but she's our chairwoman

244
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:10,100
does a fantastic job and I just learned

245
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,030
backstage I didn't realize she is

246
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,160
simultaneously now running for two

247
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,290
positions she's running for the EU

248
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,650
Parliament and she's also running for

249
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:22,500
the Estonian national parliament so if

250
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,910
that's the case if she wins then she

251
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,960
can't be our chairwoman but then she's

252
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,550
going to be on to bigger and better

253
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,500
things really trying to take the fight

254
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,079
into the government and trying to make

255
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,750
things better at a national or European

256
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,750
level so with that I'm really proud and

257
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,750
pleased to introduce marina come on up

258
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:53,720
[Music]

259
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:56,540
did I lay it on well good morning

260
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,070
everybody it's like in the United

261
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,660
Nations not many woman in the audience

262
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:06,080
so I'm happy to bring some gender

263
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:10,569
balance to the black hat conference yes

264
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:14,450
my name is marina I'm not an IT person I

265
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,850
do not know how to program and when I

266
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,740
set my son heard that I'm going to cheer

267
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,670
the global Commission he laughed

268
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:26,000
I consider myself rather being an alien

269
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,800
in today's cyber world if to use the

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,300
expression of my very good friend

271
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,969
Professor Joseph Nye I dedicated 25

272
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,459
years of my life and service to the

273
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,530
Foreign Service of Estonia besides being

274
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,990
foreign minister I was as soon as

275
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:45,350
ambassador to six countries including

276
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:48,410
Israel Russia and the United States are

277
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,730
using the United Nations I'm sharing the

278
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,920
global Commission on stability of

279
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,330
cyberspace so the logical question is

280
00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:01,280
what am I doing here the short answer is

281
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:05,810
Jeff invited and you don't say no to

282
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:09,500
Jeff he's a nice guy but seriously why

283
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:12,079
did I accept the invitation for the

284
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,850
first time I attended blackhat it was

285
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,740
blackhat USA 2017 and I listened to the

286
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,850
keynote there which was delivered by

287
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:28,690
Alex Thomas and among other things he

288
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:31,580
talked about diversity he talked about

289
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,480
broader perspective and need for

290
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,160
bringing people closer to IT community

291
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,550
he talked about social skills and

292
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,890
responsibility and diversity was the key

293
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:46,339
word which was also mentioned by Jeff

294
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:50,780
when introducing me I went to many

295
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:54,050
briefings workshops even some legal ones

296
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,480
I can't say that I blended in hundred

297
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,959
percent but I can say that people were

298
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,910
nice to me

299
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,780
they were talking to me they were

300
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:06,689
answering my questions and I felt that

301
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:10,110
in the end the IT community is very much

302
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:15,900
like our community of ordinary normal

303
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:18,870
people who do not have IT background so

304
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:23,420
if you say diversity then who can be

305
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:28,050
more diverse than a woman middle-aged

306
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:31,829
they're a middle-aged grandmother from

307
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,349
Eastern Europe without IT background to

308
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,570
speak at the black hat so that's why I'm

309
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:40,110
here Jeff thank you for taking the risk

310
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:45,300
and I'll be happy to share some of my

311
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:48,050
thoughts and ideas about nation-state

312
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,459
perspective and mainly about

313
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:54,209
multi-stakeholder perspective to cyber

314
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,880
security and by the way I'm a former

315
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,650
foreign minister which means I can say

316
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:05,550
whatever I want and I will not

317
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:08,490
responsible I come from Estonia by the

318
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,250
way I'm using slides powerpoints my kids

319
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,110
said that it's very yesterday but I

320
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,750
thought that maybe they will keep me

321
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,940
more focused and illustrate what I'm

322
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,320
going to say so yes guys I know it's

323
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,660
very yesterday I come from an Estonian a

324
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,460
country that is known for Skype but the

325
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,380
country which is also known for native

326
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,900

excellence it's also known for being the

328
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:38,430
first country in the world to introduce

329
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:41,910
ego Vermont online voting a taxation it

330
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:45,420
police and they can continue thousands

331
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:49,949
of Internet services that is part of

332
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:53,310
what we call a lifestyle we have learned

333
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,520
we have enjoyed our lifestyle and we

334
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,729
also understand that into it entails

335
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,890
challenges and responsibilities we

336
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,700
understand that no services can

337
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:09,900
completely be secured whether online or

338
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,550
offline but we can and we must face

339
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:16,620
these challenges and minimum

340
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:18,120
the risks in 2007 Estonia was the first

341
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,730
country in the world

342
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,029
to fall on the politically motivated

343
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,589
attacks against the sovereign nation

344
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:28,680
those were DDoS attacks they were

345
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:31,560
primitive by today's standards they did

346
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,120
not destruct anything they did not hurt

347
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,709
or kill anybody

348
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,320
but they were humiliating and they were

349
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:42,180
disturbing they were mainly targeting

350
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
our banking sector and also the so

351
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,469
called monumental websites like Prime

352
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,399
Minister's Office MOT MFA and so well

353
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,370
that's one our resilience was proof

354
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,310
tested I was then a student ambassador

355
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:00,480
to Russia which means that I had two

356
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:03,959
tasks I had to learn in 15 minutes what

357
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,949
does DDoS mean and start explaining it

358
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,909
to the others

359
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:11,459
I managed with that my second task was

360
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:15,650
to find ways of cooperation with

361
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:18,089
Russians I failed it takes two to tango

362
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,370
unfortunately we didn't cooperate on

363
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:24,750
fighting those who were behind and

364
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:28,319
attribution at that point more than 10

365
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,570
years have passed since then and I have

366
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,500
argue and I would argue that many things

367
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:36,689
have changed many things have improved

368
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:41,070
but there are some things that are today

369
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:45,000
as important as they were in 2007 so

370
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:48,770
what did we learn we learn the

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,120
importance of political decision making

372
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,059
having cyber secure having cyber

373
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,428
security high on political agenda which

374
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,059
means appropriate financial and human

375
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:02,059
resources to the topic we learned the

376
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:07,590
importance of having house in order

377
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:11,720
laws regulations in place we learned as

378
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:15,659
we called it then all nation approach

379
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,140
it's a policy where all our stakeholders

380
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:22,520
are included into cooperation not only

381
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,710
governments but also other stakeholders

382
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:31,350
private sector industry I can

383
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:33,299
amia civil society the collaboration

384
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,428
between private and public sector has in

385
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:38,789
my country being the center of our

386
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:41,070
innovation and since the early days the

387
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,010
government's philosophy was not to hire

388
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,700
programmers but to use the services of

389
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,470
private companies which in turn

390
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:54,120
increased the competitiveness of the

391
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:56,730
Estonian IT sector and finally we

392
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,070
learned about need of international

393
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,730
cooperation cooperation cooperation

394
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,889
cooperation cyber does not have borders

395
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,529
and that's why if you want to be

396
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,320
efficient you have to cooperate with

397
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:13,640
others

398
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,720
what if J wood has changed since 2007

399
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,720
cyber attacks have become a new

400
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,539
normality they target States as well as

401
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,669
companies and citizens they have become

402
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,399
global and massive in their scale and

403
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,799
they even challenge the a new genuine

404
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:34,110
political independence hacks against

405
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:38,179
democracy what has improved first and I

406
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:41,070
would say most importantly awareness

407
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,970
2004 when a stone a joined EU NATO

408
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,980
nobody was talking about cybersecurity

409
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:50,159
2018 everybody talking about cyber

410
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,730
security cyber hygiene has been

411
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,230
introduced to our first graders all

412
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,360
universities are teaching cyber in one

413
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,940
form or another international

414
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,250
conferences there are about 100

415
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:10,350
diplomatic efforts to discuss

416
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:14,190
cybersecurity some of the questions that

417
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:17,389
we tackled in 2007 remain the same for

418
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,700
example the questions of attribution

419
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:24,770
countermeasures inherent right of States

420
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:27,029
for for self defense

421
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,149
responsibility of a state for the acts

422
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:35,029
of non-state actors applicability of

423
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:37,649
international law to cyber hack backs

424
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,900
offensive capabilities and I can

425
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:44,360
continue all this top

426
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:48,480
or today as important as they were then

427
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,300
from here I'd like to talk about the

428
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,460
role of different stakeholders in the

429
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,129
process of cyber security digital

430
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,580
cooperation digital stability and start

431
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,010
with States and governments I would

432
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:06,199
argue that states and governments have a

433
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:10,020
unique role in securing cyber security

434
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:15,170
but for the first time in the history of

435
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:18,389
mankind States alone can't be efficient

436
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:22,080
so it's very different from what we were

437
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:24,450
used to see till today weapons of mass

438
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,480
destruction nuclear weapons and so on

439
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,929
and so on and so on cyber is so wide

440
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:36,090
that States alone can't be efficient in

441
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:39,330
providing security it's a space where

442
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,970
private sector rules nearly all digital

443
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,090
and physical assets and has the best IT

444
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:48,200
experts is the sphere where civil

445
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:50,459
society can produce norms

446
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,610
recommendations of responsible state

447
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,460
behavior it's a space where civil

448
00:21:53,610 --> 00:22:01,350
society is also the watchdog of human

449
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,720
rights and international law on national

450
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:09,030
level the responsibility of a state is

451
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:11,400
to keep exchanges secure state has the

452
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,670
responsibility for a secure exchange of

453
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,950
data and integrity of data States has a

454
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,410
responsibility to introduce laws of

455
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:23,850
regulations state has a responsibility

456
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:27,170
of authentication creating enabling

457
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:33,530
conditions and thinking out of the box

458
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:40,020
most crucial state has to play a role in

459
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:41,340
in creating and preserving trust I bring

460
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,650
you a couple of examples from the

461
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,689
National statements or the National

462
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:48,740
positions of my government I think

463
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:53,280
they're kind of out of box thinking a

464
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,770
residency and a Embassy's a residency

465
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,330
starting

466
00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:00,100
a startup a couple of guys came to the

467
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,740
government saying that they would like

468
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,800
to increase our population up to ten

469
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,470
million our population is 1.3 million

470
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,590
it's one street in Cairo its district in

471
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:14,740
London so their aim was to increase our

472
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,439
population it was a start-up governments

473
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,260
usually don't do startups so needless to

474
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,150
say how hesitant even I was as a foreign

475
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,910
minister I was worried about the image

476
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,880
of my country but those guys were so

477
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:31,180
convincing we did it so

478
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,550
IRA's it's not a visa it's not the

479
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,750
residence permit but it gives foreigners

480
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:39,879
who apply for a residency the right to

481
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,280
participate in some of the internet

482
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,250
online services who are providing to our

483
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:48,610
own residents mainly digital signature

484
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:53,160
digital signature which which saves five

485
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:57,040
working days per year 2% of GDP per year

486
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:59,170
another is data embassy which allows the

487
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,750
host critical databases in another

488
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,850
country and allows access to databases

489
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,780
in the case they could not be accessed

490
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:10,060
from Estonia so we concluded a bilateral

491
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:14,320
agreement with Luxembourg while

492
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:17,320
Luxembourg well friendly country well

493
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,360
positioned geographically and has stayed

494
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,980
tuned high-security data centers that

495
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,389
have been certified at tier four level

496
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,530
states have to start thinking about

497
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:31,570
regulating artificial intelligence not

498
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,470
only self-driving cars but artificial

499
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:39,300
intelligence they are rights obligations

500
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:42,430
liabilities on international level

501
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,490
states have to start a staff states have

502
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:48,580
to continue cooperating globally

503
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:50,680
regionally bilaterally globally we are

504
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,429
living in a time where the ideological

505
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,260
division is growing bigger and bigger

506
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:59,080
jiff mentioned that I was twice a stone

507
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,530
an expert at the UN Gigi meetings and I

508
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,429
saw it how to understandings of the use

509
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:09,910
of ICTs are taking States apart

510
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:12,250
on one side like-minded states who see

511
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:15,040
the benefits of the use of ICTs and

512
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,850
those who challenges on the other side

513
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,070
states who see the use of ICTs as a way

514
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,969
of interfering into their domestic

515
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:27,659
affairs brainwashing their citizens

516
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:30,309
coming for their sovereignty and

517
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,190
unfortunately this ideological division

518
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,559
still exists so that even today in the

519
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,410
United Nations we have two resolutions

520
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,870
one proposed by that sponsored by the

521
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:44,320
United States proposing the next GG

522
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:47,860
another proposed by Russia proposing the

523
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,200
next open-ended working group I don't

524
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,780
know how it will work but what's

525
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,800
important whatever United Nations will

526
00:25:52,780 --> 00:26:00,580
do it has to be inclusive it can't be

527
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:04,860
for selected group of states it has to

528
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:07,809
be open if we want the report to be

529
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,928
important for the whole mankind globally

530
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:12,879
then we have to inform all the countries

531
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:20,220
all the nations who are interested

532
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:22,690
during the process of deliberations and

533
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,600
finally if I will talk about States

534
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:30,070
there are two things that I think have

535
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,678
changed during 2018 more precisely the

536
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:35,350
evolving state practice of attribution

537
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:41,590
and discussion about offensive

538
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:44,820
capabilities as the attribution one

539
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:48,399
might argue that too little and too late

540
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,490
has been done but stay by States let me

541
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,390
remind the first attribution of Sony

542
00:26:51,490 --> 00:27:00,100
attacks 2015 attribution of DNC hacks

543
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:03,059
2016 2017 attribution of wanna cry and

544
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,590
attack against Ukrainian power grid

545
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,809
countries did not support United States

546
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:12,100
the United States was left alone with

547
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:15,610
attribution breakthrough came the spring

548
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,780
when UK attributed not Paytm to Russia

549
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,379
and it was supported by more than states

550
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,559
including

551
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,020
US Canada Japan Denmark Estonia New

552
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:28,299
Zealand Australia which he needed to

553
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:33,039
raise the question but where is Germany

554
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:36,490
where is France where is Italy where are

555
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,890
others others meaning the EU responded

556
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,480
in April the same year with constant

557
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,900
conclusions on malicious cyber

558
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,380
activities the statement was really poor

559
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:51,490
and weak he did not name any countries

560
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:53,770
it expressed its concierge concern about

561
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,870
the increased ability and willingness of

562
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,510
third States and non-state actors to

563
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,059
pursue their objectives by undertaking

564
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:05,470
malicious cyber activities that is the

565
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:07,840
text of the statement but it has to be

566
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,720
recognized that for the first time all

567
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,030
EU Member States

568
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,210
collectively supported attribution by

569
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:18,428
another state and that's in a pod and

570
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:22,179
that is an important step in forming

571
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:25,960
state practice later attributions were

572
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:27,610
followed by additional cases Britain and

573
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,340
Netherlands accused Russia of sending

574
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,830
agents with Wi-Fi antennas to the Hague

575
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,020
to try to hack into the organization for

576
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,020
the prohibition of chemical weapons the

577
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,360
United States indicated seven Russian

578
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,668
agents for conspiring to hack computers

579
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,830
and steal data to deleted mais

580
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:47,080
international anti-doping organisations

581
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,110
and what was important about those

582
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,330
attributions was that the first one

583
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,620
against the against Russians hacking

584
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,899
into the organization for the

585
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,479
prohibition of chemical weapons it was

586
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,000
supported collectively by all NATO

587
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,100
member states it was expressed in a

588
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,539
statement by the Secretary General of

589
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:10,510
NATO en Stoltenberg I would like to

590
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:14,379
stress two aspects readiness of states

591
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:18,789
to openly attribute and readiness of

592
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:22,659
others to support attribution going back

593
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:24,789
to 2007 how did we attribute I will then

594
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:28,059
Defense Minister answered the question

595
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:31,450
and his logic was if somebody looks like

596
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:34,360
a dog barked like a dog eats like a dog

597
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,330
then most probably it's a dog in all

598
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,729
case it was a beer it took a couple of

599
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:43,510
years before we attributed more

600
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,789
concretely so what I see today 11 12

601
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,309
years later states are supporting each

602
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:51,070
other's attributions and these are very

603
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:56,129
strong and powerful and political

604
00:29:51,070 --> 00:30:00,149
movements second offensive capabilities

605
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:04,179
for years it was not okay to talk about

606
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:05,979
defensive offensive capabilities for

607
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,840
years it was a topic that everybody

608
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,169
discussed in the corners but never

609
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,279
publicly Australia was the first country

610
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:17,320
in the world in 2016 to confirm that

611
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,380
Australia had an offensive cyber

612
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,289
capability to respond to serious cyber

613
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:27,309
attacks support military operations and

614
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:30,850
counter offshore cyber criminals in

615
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:33,370
November 2017 NATO announced that NATO

616
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,678
embraced the use of cyber weaponry in

617
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,570
NATO operations that the danger is ready

618
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,990
to use the cyber capabilities of its

619
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:45,809
members to deter attacks in the same way

620
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:48,850
as it uses land sea and air weaponry I

621
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:50,820
would say that it's a good thing the

622
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:54,610
discussions like that are taking place

623
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:58,269
and it's very important to reiterate

624
00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:00,939
that whatever measures are undertaken

625
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:04,019
whatever countermeasures are taken they

626
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:08,559
have to be taken in correspondence with

627
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:11,220
international law and the important it's

628
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:15,490
important to consider necessity

629
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:18,070
specificity proportionality and harm in

630
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,649
case offensive capabilities are used of

631
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,769
course it raises many questions

632
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:28,059
including private hack backs but to have

633
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:30,130
the discussion openly is better than not

634
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:34,860
to have it or have it behind closed

635
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:37,000
doors first of all the

636
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:41,189
multi-stakeholders cooperation with

637
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,020
private sector there are no golden rules

638
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:47,320
every state and government has to find

639
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,160
its own way this is the logo of the

640
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,639
Estonia

641
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,920
cyber defense unit a voluntary military

642
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,910
organization that came to assist

643
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,800
government in 2007 and state and they

644
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:03,790
filmed themselves officially a year

645
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:08,220
later people with different backgrounds

646
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:11,560
ID people lawyers economists doctors

647
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,780
with security clearances are working

648
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:17,110
free for government during their

649
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,970
weekends and free time governments can

650
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,159
never afford them at least the student

651
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,620
government can't they're doing it

652
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,800
voluntarily but they are doing it out of

653
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,510
patriotism they're doing it for free I

654
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,850
don't want to say that everybody has to

655
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,670
follow that rule that was our that was

656
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:37,120
our way and we were lucky to have the

657
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,400
attacks of 2007 to reconsider and once

658
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,750
again reconsider how to continue with

659
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,740
our II Estonia

660
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,800
first of all governments have to

661
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,750
overcome mistrust towards private sector

662
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,919
and industry governments have to

663
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:56,800
understand it's a two-way cooperation as

664
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,870
a foreign minister meeting industry and

665
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,700
private sector I was hearing all the

666
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:03,489
time the government's are not listening

667
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,040
to us they are not including us into the

668
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,890
deliberations they are not taking us

669
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:15,060
seriously and to some extent that was

670
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:18,970
true I'll bring you examples of two

671
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:22,080
documents that were published and that

672
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:26,890
were launched this spring

673
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,649
one is the Microsoft's global take a

674
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:33,100
code and another is the charter of trust

675
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:35,140
by Siemens and the supporters they have

676
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,080
many most important that on the screen

677
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,750
at the moment but that was a cry from

678
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,449
the sector let's cooperate we are

679
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:47,950
proposing please take us seriously look

680
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:50,650
at what we are proposing civil society

681
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,650
has its role yes i'm honored and proud

682
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,470
to to be the chair of the global

683
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,450
Commission of stability of cyberspace

684
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,820
which is one of the platforms that can

685
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,840
contribute to international discussion

686
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,428
today

687
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,350
you remember I mentioned the huge

688
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:08,500
division ideological division in the

689
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:10,239
United Nations at the time when states

690
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,190
are not active

691
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,408
at the time when states are still

692
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,770
thinking how to continue with

693
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:20,020
negotiations I think that a political

694
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:23,560
institutions like the global Commission

695
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:26,469
can contribute to the discussion not

696
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,989
replace any of the interstate any global

697
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:33,668
organizations but contribute to the

698
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:36,250
discussion so the global Commission I

699
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:41,230
think Jeff also said was launched in

700
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:44,080
2017 and it has wide range of

701
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:47,710
Representatives from Berkeley to Beijing

702
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,080
from Thailand to johannes pork we have

703
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,418
former politicians we have people

704
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,719
representing academia human rights

705
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:59,770
hackers hackers so we have very

706
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:02,589
different people there and in practice I

707
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:05,140
would say that it's the first time when

708
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:09,130
I've seen such a multi-stakeholder model

709
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:14,290
in practice and working the discussions

710
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:17,650
are tough we've been the first norms

711
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:20,470
that we that we introduced already last

712
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,830
year was our call to protect the public

713
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:27,399
core of Internet and our pool not to

714
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:30,069
interfere into electoral systems those

715
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,109
discussions were difficult because

716
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:35,650
trying to get into the same room a

717
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:37,900
lawyer IT person former politician

718
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,210
different views different understandings

719
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,070
that's why the norms that you can find

720
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,800
also on a website they're not final

721
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:47,349
documents they are living documents and

722
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,760
with the public code to protect with the

723
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:52,300
gnome to protect the public power of

724
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:57,099
Internet we developed and we looked into

725
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:59,950
the first definition and after it had it

726
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:01,960
had been discussed widely by one of our

727
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:05,740
commissioners bill Woodcock with IT

728
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:09,400
people we rephrased it and we went much

729
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:15,750
deeper with the definition so at the

730
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:19,540
moment we're working on six norms

731
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:22,839
which mainly have to do with the secure

732
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,779
supply chain the rule of states the role

733
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:28,810
of non-state actors and we call it

734
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:32,080
Singapore package we don't want to be

735
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:34,630
unknown producing factory only we also

736
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,119
want to look into the future and see how

737
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,190
should be the discussion in cyber world

738
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,349
further structured what are the

739
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:46,210
mechanisms and principles that might be

740
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:49,450
useful and one of the norms is dealing

741
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,609
with cyber hygiene something I would say

742
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:54,160
that connects all about the stakeholders

743
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:56,890
our norm on cyber hygiene says that

744
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,649
states should enact appropriate measures

745
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,839
including laws and regulations to ensure

746
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,839
basic cyber hygiene

747
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,599
so after almost two years of

748
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:14,910
deliberations we have not still answered

749
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:18,490
the questions what is cyber stability

750
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:23,500
what is cyber security what is digital

751
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:26,848
stability what is digital security is it

752
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:30,010
open free accessible affordable Internet

753
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:34,089
is it open secure stable accessible

754
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:36,430
peaceful ICT environment is it keeping

755
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:38,349
cyberspace open free stable and secure

756
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,710
where fundamental rights and the rule of

757
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:42,750
law

758
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:45,300
fully apply or is it an ideal State

759
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,190
where individuals institutions

760
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,800
organizations and states are confident

761
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,470
in their ability to use cyberspace

762
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,900
safely and securely and where the

763
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:59,529
general availability and integrity of

764
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,780
services in cyberspace is assured most

765
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,680
probably we will be discussing the last

766
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,410
one but again having work having having

767
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,348
worked now for almost two years we are

768
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:13,930
still in the face we are discussing what

769
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:15,820
are we discussing mobile Commission's on

770
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:22,210
cyber stability what is the definition

771
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:24,130
of cyber security cyber stability and I

772
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:28,059
would like to draw your attention to two

773
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:31,689
a document it's the Paris call for

774
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:34,749
trust and security in cyberspace it was

775
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:37,629
launched a couple of weeks ago in the

776
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:40,689
margins of the celebration of the 100th

777
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:43,449
anniversary of the victory after the

778
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:46,930
first world war it was launched by

779
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:50,529
President McCrone and what makes this

780
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:54,038
document special is the fact that it

781
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:57,789
talks about cooperation he talks about

782
00:38:54,039 --> 00:39:01,829
the need to include all stakeholders and

783
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:06,759
it's been supported by almost 400

784
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:09,539
signatories more than 50 states more

785
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:13,299
than 100 civil society representatives

786
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:16,439
more than 200 industry and private

787
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:19,209
sector representatives I don't remember

788
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:22,509
that any document about cyber security

789
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:25,538
and Trust in digital sphere has ever

790
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:29,049
been so widely supported what does it

791
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:32,079
mean it means that international

792
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:35,799
community and States are ready to

793
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,920
cooperate to cooperate they are ready to

794
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:39,599
the process of inclusiveness

795
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,650
multi-stakeholder model

796
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,859
multi-stakeholder initiative whatever we

797
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:47,170
like to call it it's there the time is

798
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:50,170
ready and I mean I'm hearing it also

799
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:56,410
from the government's something that I

800
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:58,929
haven't heard so strongly before so what

801
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:04,149
what would expect from the coming year

802
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:06,880
coming years globally United Nations

803
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,219
secretary-general launched high-level

804
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,799
panel on digital cooperation last summer

805
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:16,119
and I'm honored to be a member of that

806
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:21,809
panel the panel is chaired by co-chaired

807
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:25,979
by Melinda Gates and Jack Mar the panel

808
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:28,479
has its objective to introduce

809
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:30,939
recommendations about principles

810
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:33,249
mechanisms best practices of digital

811
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:35,618
cooperation it will not cover only

812
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:37,379
cybersecurity or digital security it

813
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:40,289
will look into development cooperation

814
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,250
awareness raising education trade

815
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:44,590
finances every

816
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:48,280
what I want from that panel I want

817
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:50,230
clarity I want clear understanding if we

818
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,890
talk about inclusiveness what does it

819
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:56,980
mean does it mean only private sector

820
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:00,339
does it mean also academia civil society

821
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,960
I want the panel to underline the

822
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,200
importance of applicability of

823
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:09,400
international law to cyber the less grey

824
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,740
zones the better for the security the

825
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:17,860
panel will end its work next year by

826
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:20,379
report like-minded States I'm looking at

827
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,930
like-minded states and wishing that they

828
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:26,140
will continue with their practice of

829
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:30,100
attribution supporting attribution

830
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:32,589
creating States practice state practice

831
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,569
might create customary law state

832
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,520
practice might create norms or

833
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,950
responsible state behavior state

834
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,040
practice might create the rules and

835
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,689
norms how cyberspace is and should be

836
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,009
governed

837
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:48,520
nobody August today that international

838
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:52,150
law applies to cyber the question is how

839
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:56,410
and with every step of attribution the

840
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:59,710
question how has a tiny answer I'm

841
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:03,040
looking at states it's time for states

842
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:06,840
to turn from public-private partnerships

843
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:11,200
logan's into real working partnership

844
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm looking at cyber Giants who are

845
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,460
bigger than states for their

846
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,390
responsibility and they are willingness

847
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:23,640
to take responsibility and cooperate and

848
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:25,589
I'm looking at multi-stakeholders us

849
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,520
because today I feel that

850
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,980
multi-stakeholders have the role and

851
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,600
have the possibility to contribute to

852
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:35,220
the international discussion even

853
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:38,140
between the states more than ever before

854
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:42,399
so the initiative should should start

855
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:45,400
from the bottom let's look into what we

856
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,560
are proposing let's consider it let's

857
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,870
take it seriously let's support each

858
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,940
other and then governments who will

859
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,940
listen to us to us much more

860
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:04,930
and finally these are bugs

861
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:08,830
these are cyber bugs one of them to the

862
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:11,290
right was presented to me by my IT

863
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,080
people when I stepped down as a stone

864
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:16,360
and foreign minister and they said that

865
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,009
they hope that will be the only bug in

866
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:24,760
my life the bug to the left was

867
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:27,760
presented to me in North in in

868
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,890
Charleston South Carolina when I was

869
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,610
visiting the college there and the

870
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,730
Citadel

871
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:36,600
they didn't say but the thinking was the

872
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:40,470
same so if I think about

873
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:43,569
multi-stakeholders these are like bugs

874
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:46,509
multi-stakeholders can do and should do

875
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:49,530
the same should aim at the same

876
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:54,420
objectives only then we can make

877
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:59,790
cyberspace safe secure accessible free

878
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,790
resilient and affordable thank you

879
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:11,880
Thank You thanks okay everyone I just

880

896
