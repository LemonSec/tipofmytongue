1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,308
so good evening welcome welcome you guys

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:11,610
thanks for joining us today

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:16,100
so my name is Franco meth this is the

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:19,410
sacrament we are working at Devo and

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,130
before start the presentation we would

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,650
like to play with you and show you what

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,330
want to do today with you and what I

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:34,079
want to which the this presentation is

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:40,230
just about the facial recognition so we

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:43,640
can start making this okay so first we

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,640
will show two videos

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:03,530
okay you can sell the videos okay this

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,530
video is just a video from ore company

14
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:10,649
it's a great company and in this in this

15
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,350
case we are using a training set that

16
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:16,649
contains a lot of image from from Rahul

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:24,839
from some oil and we are detecting these

18
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:25,890
guys in a very well way okay so if we

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,360
try to do this

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,390
just using the face from the liquid it

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,929
contact okay we are getting all or

22
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,720
liquid in contact we can so that we can

23
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:43,950
detect who of these guys of the company

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,470
are in your contact list so here you can

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,140
see there are a lot of unknowns because

26
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,030
the training set is too poor

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,390
we have only one we much form from the

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,969
face this is not a good training set but

29
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,630
you can see all my contact and you will

30
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:07,770
see the contact us that we are setting

31
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:14,519
sesor on me okay so they are eating a

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:20,579
lot okay the idea is make this right now

33
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:27,329
okay do you wanna play so this small

34
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:31,980
phone is just streaming the video to the

35
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:34,709
laptop okay the pilot is not good okay

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,350
and the idea is we are trying to know

37
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,590
who have to iron my link at the contact

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:46,500
it's better than it scan the budget okay

39
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,209
so can I get your a much we are not

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,489
recording we are not equally kinda can I

41
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,209
like using a streaming I know if you are

42
00:02:50,489 --> 00:03:02,030
in my contact and I know are young in

43
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:06,070
your contacts maybe no yes yes

44
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,430
I have only one photo from linka Dean so

45
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:21,170
the facial-recognition not not so good

46
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:28,760
okay but up here yeah okay so any of you

47
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:33,140
are in our contacts no no this could be

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,600
failed we are talking about false

49
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:45,440
positives and false negatives how many

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:49,370
years has your food okay so this is just

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:55,040
a demo to show what kind of things we

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:04:00,800
are trying to do today okay so let's

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,870
continue with a presentation or a Yonder

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,560
today is just talking about open source

55
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,530
intelligence video analysis of course

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,170
and the face recognition and at the end

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,660
we will show an example and a new

58
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:22,180
circuit each case to use this kind of

59
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:24,740
technology applied to some of you so

60
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,840
let's start with the open source

61
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,430
intelligent how many of you know what is

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,869
open source intelligence more all of you

63
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,250
know what the suppressors intelligence

64
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,680
for me the best definition stands like

65
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,340
this information does not have to be

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,440
sacred to be valuable okay another

67
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,150
definition could be this open source

68
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,020
intelligence the data collect from

69
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,239
publicly available sources to be used in

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,580
an Italian context and Indian context is

71
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,110
the place is when you have all the

72
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,370
information that you need to take a good

73
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,440
decision okay so you can use open source

74
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,540
intelligent to the National Security

75
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,890
counter terrorists you can use to

76
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,169
monitor competitors to identity persons

77
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,650
many application like even you can get

78
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,870
the ROI from your advertisement and the

79
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,810
mania yes in this case don't identify

80
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,330
faces you notify logos brands and this

81
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,150
kind of things and count the amount of

82
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,630
time of your logo are in your screens in

83
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:31,388
TV in something like that so today we

84
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:36,009
are trying to show you the capability of

85
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:39,669
the video analysis so this is because by

86
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:43,810
2021 80% of the world's Internet traffic

87
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:46,508
video traffic will be video ok so this

88
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,210
is a forecast and for this year the

89
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,120
forecast is that 90 million of terabytes

90
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,698
or more will be video on internet while

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,650
only 2% of this video is from

92
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:03,430
surveillance cameras so this data from

93
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:08,039
Cisco so video is an important source

94
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:12,699
and it's growing because every day much

95
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,530
much more video are loved by users

96
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,860
because users don't want to text or

97
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,409
write

98
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,650
you said want to listen and talk ok we

99
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,419
are live C beta so let's move to the

100
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,370
last point and I'd like to say with you

101
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,039
an example of how video processing come

102
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:30,780
helps you to obtain more information

103
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:34,960
okay we're sorry but the video has

104
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:38,650
sensitive content okay the video is part

105
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,590
of the Isis propaganda campaign I know

106
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:45,669
if you are you know about the ISIS

107
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,590
propaganda I so so you can show in the

108
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,799
video how some tourists killed some ho

109
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,320
States and the idea is to know where and

110
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,500
when the video was record okay

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,169
and to do that the first question where

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,050
the video was record you can use image

113
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:05,169
foreign from Google Maps and correlate

114
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,930
with the building roads and buses in the

115
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,659
video to get the location of the video

116
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,510
when you get the location of the video

117
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,639
you can know where the when the video

118
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,639
was recorded okay to get this

119
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,719
information you can use the blood spots

120
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:27,130
in the ground and thanks to the Google

121
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:28,430
history database you can compare and get

122
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,130
when the video

123
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,210
recorded so before the video analyst

124
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,240
analysis

125
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,669
you only know that some people were

126
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,580
killed and after the video processing do

127
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,020
you know when and where these their

128
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:48,530
people were killed

129
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:51,919
okay so today we focus on facial

130
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,359
recognition because it's a one of the

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,420
machine learning application that has

132
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,150
had more advantages a in recent years so

133
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,220
before since I shows you how did the

134
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,039
facial recognition works in a hard way

135
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,440
I will try to still share with you my

136
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,750
six simple steps to understand the face

137
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,450
organism so the first step is you need

138
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,740
to know where the faces you can use hawk

139
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,900
or CNN algorithms

140
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,080
okay and then you can obtain the

141
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,650
landmarks and you need to align the

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,260
image to get the correct landmarks so

143
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:30,710
you can scale rotate or stretch the

144
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,710
image and when you have the face and

145
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:37,490
their landmarks align it you can obtain

146
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:42,800
the vector RI that defines you your face

147
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:45,290
okay the metro ride is just 128 values

148
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,400
that define the face and you can use

149
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,740
this to compare with all other faces

150
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,480
that you have in your database so since

151
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,550
I explained these guys they process in

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:02,480
the hard way okay I hope this is not the

153
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,459
hard way but okay in the first step we

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,490
try to identify where are the faces in

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,580
the image or in the videos do we need

156
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:16,250
the coordinates of the face that appears

157
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:19,610
in this video or in this image well this

158
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,800
is not a simple task because like you

159
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,440
can see Will Ferrell and chatters need

160
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,339
our like katrin's but they are not funny

161
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,490
no no but even the five-person is not a

162
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:37,400
simple path if you think if even if I

163
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:40,970
object it's more easy and ICU is easy to

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,140
identify and difference fine difference

165
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,940
between muffin

166
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:51,439
and chihuahuas all the people say yes

167
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:53,630
but this is not a easy way okay like you

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,570
can see in this image which are

169
00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:02,839
chihuahuas and which are muffins is very

170
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:06,500
complicated to say okay the recognition

171
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,420
of these faces where are the faces in

172
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:15,140
the image in this in this tulké we talk

173
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:18,260
about hoc Instagram of Oriental

174
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:22,040
gradients and CNN convolutional neural

175
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:25,189
network well start with the Easter Ram

176
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,219
of oriented gradients to locate face in

177
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:35,269
image well the hot technique was

178
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:38,000
developed in 2005 and try to find when

179
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:42,950
the darkness points of the image smooth

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,329
and draw oriented gradients tours these

181
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,820
directions you can obtain some image

182
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:55,099
like you can see is a pattern or my face

183
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:58,250
of a pattern of frank face and you can

184
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:02,930
try to find this kind of patterns along

185
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:05,630
the wall image in the video well when

186
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,829
you can see this kind of pattern is very

187
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:12,769
it's very easy to to use in the in image

188
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:14,989
but they have a problem with the

189
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,470
orientation of the object this kind of

190
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,649
patterns is invariant when the face are

191
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,110
in left corner or in the right corner of

192
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,860
the image but this varying is the faces

193
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:32,779
in the in the front or by side of this

194
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:38,390
kind of tense well for classification of

195
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:41,420
patterns in an image in a video identify

196
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:44,870
where our faces and were what our widget

197
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:49,180
objects are not faces we use a super

198
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:53,720
better matching algorithm this is all

199
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:56,329
algorithm and try to identify and what

200
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,610
objects our faces are rough

201
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:04,100
this is Bassett in a create an optimal

202
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,920
hyperplane that debate the plan in two

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,550
dimensions you divide the plan in two

204
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,969
areas and in one area our faces and in

205
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:18,740
the other area are no faces well in n

206
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:21,740
dimensions like we use in the hawk

207
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:27,650
algorithm this hyperplane is a surface

208
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:30,050
in n dimensions okay the other the other

209
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,970
techniques that we can use to identify

210
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,270
where are the faces are the

211
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:39,890
convolutional neural networks and this

212
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:43,610
one use in to address various problems

213
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:47,199
in recent years and have the advantage

214
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:49,970
that is the signal to require much lower

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,670
professing that traditional deep neural

216
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:57,710
networks the networks I inspired in the

217
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,709
connectivity patterns in the neurons of

218
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:03,020
the cortex of the visual cortex of

219
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,500
animals and the first step in

220
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,150
convolutional neural network is a

221
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,270
convolutional operation the very easy

222
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:14,540
you start with a matrix of the image

223
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:18,470
with all the values of a each point in

224
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:22,520
the image and apply a kernel this is

225
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,790
this kind of matrix in this case 3 times

226
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:30,380
3 matrix and make operation light you

227
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:33,110
can see plus and multiplicative

228
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,460
alleyways and obtain a final matrix with

229
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:41,570
the representatives obvious

230
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:44,090
yes values of the objects well for

231
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,820
example if you cry if you try to the

232
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,580
third vertical borders or vertical edge

233
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:54,200
in image you can choose a matrix like

234
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:57,050
you can see the kernel and for the for

235
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,840
this kind of image black-and-white image

236
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,250
you can obtain the vertical border of

237
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,970
the image in the center of the matrix

238
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:09,350
normalizing these values to 255 for a

239
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,740
grayscale

240
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:18,490
image okay you can choose or you can use

241
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:21,710
GIMP tool to make this kind of of

242
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,770
operations and play with it because the

243
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:28,300
game tool have our convolutional matrix

244
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,939
operation in this case with my photo

245
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:35,150
apply a kernel like you can see in the

246
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:38,000
previous image with 1 0 and minus 1 in

247
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,090
each column and obtain the vertical edge

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,460
of an image

249
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,440
well the next operation in convolutional

250
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:49,340
neural network is a subsampling these

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,280
are reducing the amount of data and one

252
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,470
of the mouse use is max pooling in this

253
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,569
case the max filling operation is very

254
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,560
easy to explain you choose some magic

255
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:03,950
side in disguise 2 times 2 and divide

256
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:09,040
the image in regions and choose for each

257
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:12,980
region the eigenvalue of each sector

258
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:18,050
saving 9 am-4 in the image like you can

259
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:20,600
see finally with all these kind of

260
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,780
operations convolutional sampling

261
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,630
convolutional sampling you obtain a lot

262
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,240
of matrix and big matrix are flattening

263
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:33,280
in a vector and this vector is the field

264
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,690
for a traditional neural network a

265
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,720
traditional neural network where her

266
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,510
inputs Harris radium fractions her

267
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:49,640
outputs and the output is the location

268
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:52,640
of the face calcium you can use singing

269
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:57,860
in CNN videos because the wall

270
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:02,060
Kalen close by layer or Eccleston okay

271
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,490
when use CNN or hog well seeing a green

272
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,060
is more precise in up your recognition

273
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,310
but in contrast hog is faster in

274
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:16,010
processing you can use for processing of

275
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:18,020
line of or video in real-time yes well

276
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,390
these techniques of object recognition

277
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,269
facial recognition in more ok

278
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:27,920
can be used to identify a lot of objects

279
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:32,440
like buildings cars flags like you can

280
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:40,250
see in the image or guns got some roses

281
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:44,089
all the things I love rock okay the next

282
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:49,100
step is find some specific points in the

283
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:52,370
faces call it called landmarks these

284
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:58,190
points even define some parts of the

285
00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:02,209
face the nose the chain and why do need

286
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,250
these points because in the next step we

287
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,399
obtain a code for each face

288
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,339
I need all the face alig not to the same

289
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:14,559
position we identify this object and

290
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:18,470
with operation like scaling rotating

291
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,589
stretching you can align all the face to

292
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,959
the same position in this case like you

293
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:27,829
can see this affine transformation

294
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:30,730
deform a little the image but of saying

295
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:35,600
a better results in the next step the

296
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:38,720
next step is basically face encoding is

297
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:44,540
used to obtain a numerical code for a

298
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:49,429
face and assist investigation in 2015 by

299
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:52,639
Google and use a normal neural network

300
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:56,120
and this network is training wind with

301
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,510
triplets these triplets are two-faced

302
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,360
belong today to one person one face

303
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:05,000
belongs to the other person this allow

304
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,399
to minimize the distance between false

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,580
positives false negatives positives and

306
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:14,380
negative results and finally obtain a

307
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:19,428
vector like you can see these are the

308
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:23,600
128 dimensions or 128 measurements of 3h

309
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:28,160
face and and this is like vehicle plate

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,559
of a person in this case this these

311
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,260
numbers don't correspond with any

312
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,220
measurements of the face is not the

313
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,908
distance between the

314
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:41,240
or the length of the nose there are only

315
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:45,250
the exit or the output of the neural

316
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,710
network training with triplets

317
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,169
well after that go to the last step the

318
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,590
facial recognition and in this step you

319
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:58,120
can obtain true positive if you can if

320
00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:00,799
you find in this example in this example

321
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,758
Thatcher is in the image and that sir is

322
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:07,158
the Tector one false positive is Tessa

323
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:11,149
is not in the image but Tessa is

324
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:13,820
detected a false negative in in the case

325
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:17,120
that Tessa is in the image but Tessa is

326
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,779
not that anger to negative if Tessa is

327
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,189
not in the image and Sasha is not that

328
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:30,710
we we try to maximize this to result

329
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:35,929
because there are the good results well

330
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:38,960
for this we use our tolerance and we use

331
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:42,019
the Euclidean distance between vectors

332
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,320
the 128 vectors in the neck in the

333
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,840
previous steps and use our tolerance and

334
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,350
if the Clarion distance between these

335
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:57,019
two Webster are in or tolerant range the

336
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:59,360
person is the the same person yeah yeah

337
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,909
yeah you can move the tolerance to

338
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,918
balance between two negative false

339
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,799
positive through positive through

340
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,200
narratives and like you can see you can

341
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,168
obtain a balance between false positive

342
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,090
rate and sensitivity in a ROC curve like

343
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,090
you can see in others machine learning

344
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:23,240
algorithms

345
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:26,779
yeah well all of these steps allow us to

346
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:30,080
identify the person that's no half in

347
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:33,470
your models database to identify this

348
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:39,610
person but what's happening with the

349
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:39,610
persons that the know they are known

350
00:20:40,660 --> 00:21:35,690
okay so you know so so I known unknowns

351
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:37,120
why why we are talking about are known

352
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,470
unknowns in facial recognition

353
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,110
presentation okay this is because our

354
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,990
use case today is related the Isis

355
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:49,129
propaganda okay I see provide a social

356
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,980
network is trying to focus on spread

357
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,360
their ideas on obviously the fear so

358
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:59,360
social network are trying to stop this

359
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,899
kind of content but they are failing so

360
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,909
where we will try to use this content

361
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:08,360
okay and the idea Justin define who who

362
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,280
in this kind of videos so the most of

363
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,559
the person in the individuals are

364
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,120
unknown unknowns and only most people

365
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:20,740
that we don't know okay we need to

366
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:23,959
classification step to identify them so

367
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,140
time to wish to see the video do you

368
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,130
know the demo

369
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,580
cross your fingers

370
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:40,000
yeah this is the hard part

371
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:43,340
okay here we have this is a the topology

372
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,080
okay with that we are using I will

373
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,540
explain the date apology and the

374
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,129
architecture so we need to start date

375
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:53,270
apology right now because the process is

376
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:57,200
so slow so we start

377
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:59,600
the process this is a local stone

378
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,580
cluster yes I don't know if you are

379
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,039
familiar with this kind of technology

380
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,299
but we will see the topology and the

381
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:11,690
cadet - don't worry

382
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:16,070
and when this is this start we need to

383
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:31,370
put two video so one I drew before in

384
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:33,860
olan olan this this this one okay so let

385
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,408
the system works and we'll explain you

386
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:41,360
the architecture and the technology that

387
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:44,809
we are using here like the system run

388
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,279
and like the river right so we are using

389
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:52,610
OpenCV yes obviously to process the the

390
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,149
video image okay so this library started

391
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:59,029
in by Intel a lot of years ago and we

392
00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:02,959
are using Apache storm as the real time

393
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:05,929
frame were processing and we are just

394
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,480
using the leap because there are a lot

395
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:11,690
of machine learning algorithms and a lot

396
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,409
of tools to process the Daihatsu and

397
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:19,580
with some libraries from Python and Java

398
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:24,440
we are just component the the system so

399
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,610
the topology is as simple as you can see

400
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,029
here okay

401
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,668
the topology is just getting a video

402
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:35,510
from Internet in this case we are just

403
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:37,279
trying videos for YouTube and dispo'd

404
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,080
the first part of the topology is

405
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,610
getting this video and split the video

406
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,830
to sampling and sending these frames to

407
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:50,479
the next step the next step is just they

408
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:54,289
identify faces this step is just trying

409
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,570
to get the faces that are in the in the

410
00:24:54,289 --> 00:25:00,158
image here we are using hawk because

411
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:03,649
this is a real-time system we can use

412
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,300
CNN and then in the next step we are

413
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:10,350
trying to recognize who is in this

414
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:12,720
in the Simmons okay so when we know that

415
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,840
the people is in there in the image we

416
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,420
store in the known people database okay

417
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,879
they wanted they wanted people models

418
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,460
who are training with CNN okay because

419
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,550
we have it's an offline process and we

420
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,630
can spend a lot of time to train in the

421
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,260
data set

422
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:34,440
okay and the last step and the more

423
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,270
complicated is what can we do with all

424
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,430
the people that we don't know that

425
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,639
people that we don't have indoor in our

426
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:43,860
model indoor training data set there are

427
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,110
known people we are just trying to put

428
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,229
in the unknown people database and we

429
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,990
are trying to put in a another database

430
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:55,800
the relationship between these guys okay

431
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:58,830
to know where a guy is okay and where

432
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,919
other guys are in the same video so the

433
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:08,030
problem here is how can group the

434
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:12,270
unknowns okay so since our please okay

435
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:15,480
in this part we will try and we use

436
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:19,610
three kinds of migrants the first of one

437
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,670
is as has similarity or a person 12 has

438
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:29,010
colored pikas because is very famous

439
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:32,220
because this is is util in in detecting

440
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,129
brands and logos in faith webs in

441
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,490
fishing cases because find the

442
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:42,120
similarity of two image and offer a

443
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:45,810
number or the Abu Dis a number and if

444
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,750
this number is similar the image are

445
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:52,770
similar in this case don't work properly

446
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:55,140
for us because the image for the

447
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:58,910
background the brightness the face

448
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:03,300
position offer different values and

449
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:06,450
don't work properly know well is the

450
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,090
neck sister yes yes the next step is

451
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:12,390
making a data set with all the face that

452
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:17,459
we can find in videos a data set with

453
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:20,100
the 128 values or our measurements of

454
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,860
each face that appear in the

455
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:28,709
you with this data set we try to use

456
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,439
Damon's algorithms and kami Sangha rooms

457
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,730
were properly but half a problem in this

458
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:41,010
algorithm you obtain a partition of the

459
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:45,450
space of the example space all the data

460
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:50,129
is around a center point colored and

461
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:52,980
cold centroid and in this case were

462
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:56,429
properly if you know how many different

463
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:00,169
peoples are in videos in this case is

464
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:03,840
difficult to obtain how many different

465
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:07,440
persons are in the videos and estimation

466
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,610
of this number with different algorithms

467
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:16,710
don't work properly for us in your case

468
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:20,250
well but finally the winner the winner

469
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:24,150
is the Chinese whisperer

470
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:27,900
Agron the salary is very useful and is

471
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:31,020
have a wide use in professing natural

472
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:34,470
language and is based on the creation of

473
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:39,408
a graph with all the face that we

474
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:43,140
identify in the previous steps with 128

475
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:47,460
vector dimensions and joining the notes

476
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,200
and follow this easy three steps like

477
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,230
you can see is very easy to implement

478
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:58,230
and very easy to use because these are a

479
00:28:52,230 --> 00:29:02,010
simple algorithm but for us offer the

480
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:06,179
best results yeah the best result this

481
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:09,690
kind of a group Asian allow allow us to

482
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:14,010
respond to question like in which video

483
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:18,360
this person appear or this person in

484
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:21,840
what other videos appears finally with

485
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:27,928
this occurring we have different and no

486
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:31,020
unknowns in groups and these groups have

487
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:33,040
the same person and by different person

488
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:40,940
of other groups

489
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:42,639
well if you need to improve the results

490
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,300
of the facial recognition

491
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:52,820
num-num in videos in YouTube videos like

492
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:55,990
we see like surveillance cameras of this

493
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,330
kind of technology you can use

494
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:02,410
three-dimensional face recognition

495
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:07,100
technology this technology can obtain

496
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:10,160
hikers equality that the two dimensions

497
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:14,330
counterparts yes for this you need

498
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,750
special camera like the 3d camera in

499
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:20,689
iPhones in facial ID technology is used

500
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:24,650
this kind of camera or intel realsense

501
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:29,420
camera and this cameras project a mesh

502
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:34,150
of infrared points to to the face or use

503
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:38,930
twin cameras to to obtain an additional

504
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:43,670
dimension that report more data to the

505
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:45,890
to to our analysis in this case if you

506
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,870
have more data in the most of the

507
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:52,210
machine learning algorithm you can

508
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:54,919
obtain better results in this case the

509
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:58,850
three-dimensional face recognition is

510
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:04,730
based in this simple simple task obtain

511
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:08,689
more data for the same face so it's time

512
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:14,540
to demo epic or fail we don't know don't

513
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:19,460
worry we have a video so the idea is

514
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:25,310
that the topology is working we'll just

515
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:31,520
say identifying extracting whispering

516
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:33,940
okay so here that the result in the file

517
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,400
system we have the people that we know

518
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:40,700
these two guys and the people that we

519
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,450
don't know here and the people that we

520
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,520
don't know classified okay so to show

521
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:51,980
this it's better to you

522
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:54,020
a graph okay so in this case I don't

523
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,780
remember who is who this is the unknown

524
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:04,910
groups yeah I prefer t their own people

525
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:17,629
okay we will see the known people so in

526
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:20,090
the it's okay okay known people this are

527
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,340
the two guys that we don't we know we

528
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:27,230
have these guys in the training set this

529
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:32,060
is a vessel I dunno Faisal and Abu Barak

530
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:34,610
al-baghdadi okay so we can see only all

531
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:38,120
the faces on the image from this guy and

532
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,800
the videos were limits are okay and in

533
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,889
the other side we have the unknown

534
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,169
groups but this stay here we had all the

535
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:50,150
unknown people that is not

536
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:52,210
classification here we have the groups

537
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:58,190
from the whisperer

538
00:32:52,210 --> 00:33:00,770
classification this guy okay and this we

539
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:05,360
have that this guy is in the same group

540
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:08,600
we have one two three videos from well

541
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,679
this guy are is but we we don't know who

542
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,879
who this guy is

543
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:16,730
okay so the idea is just two

544
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,010
classifications as a first step to to

545
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,830
get they identify you can use now for

546
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:24,470
example an external say before from

547
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:30,679
internet and intelligence services for

548
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:33,350
the police with this database you can

549
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,750
see in which other videos this person

550
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:40,100
appears and this kind of things we don't

551
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:43,340
know who is this person but we can trace

552
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,919
this person across a lot of videos a lot

553
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,800
of image and this kind of things so okay

554
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:53,150
we talked about the technology and the

555
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,830
technology has a social impact so right

556
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,420
now

557
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,580
supermarkets or retailer are using this

558
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,370
kind of technology to monitor the people

559
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,770
that are in the

560
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,899
supermarkets yes well Marcus promised

561
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,480
riding with this kind of technology to

562
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,610
identify the customers they are trying

563
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,520
to know what is your faith when you see

564
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:15,870
a new product when you see an offer

565
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,610
etc okay Tesla is watching you every

566
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:21,299
time that you cross the street

567
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:25,260
okay this is a good information that you

568
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,310
know moment in the future Tesla sell to

569
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,450
other companies

570
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:34,350
okay and even you can buy it in this

571
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:37,049
laptop just so in what you want okay you

572
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:43,799
can so Athene in in a snapshot and then

573
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:48,179
buy the van offer our amazon product so

574
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,790
if you have no time to create this kind

575
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,370
of system you can buy this camera in

576
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,090
Amazon and you obtain a lot of machine

577
00:34:53,370 --> 00:35:00,299
learning algorithms are pre training

578
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:04,740
data set you has a lot of tools and try

579
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:08,700
to use in your house yeah funny I don't

580
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:12,689
know all of these is box X in a in a

581
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,060
camera it's very easy to use decide this

582
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,650
company examples we have the most

583
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,279
controversial and my favorite example

584
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:22,230
that is the China socialist corpora

585
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,720
okay I don't know if you are familiar

586
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,810
with this program but China is

587
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:35,759
developing a program that's trying to

588
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:41,250
Calif Ocado to put just a score yeah in

589
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:45,240
a each citizen and they they the problem

590
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:50,780
will be nationwide by 2020 okay imagine

591
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:55,259
the place where your is a big brother so

592
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:59,100
we need to defense okay yeah this is

593
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,640
good for us so the idea is you can spend

594
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:05,279
money and for example by the Justice Cup

595
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,920
okay this is just a simple card that

596
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,280
contain that has a let's an infrared

597
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,940
that blinds a the cameras okay

598
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,810
I mean you can buy this some glasses is

599
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,570
cheaper

600
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:22,720
sanika start their project okay in this

601
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:26,140
case they'll have infrared LEDs he's

602
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,660
working reflect the infrareds of of a

603
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,589
camera and blintz the camera works

604
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,420
better with cameras with night vision

605
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:40,540
because the night vision of the cameras

606
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:46,450
are only with infrared LEDs there are

607
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:50,140
the infrared and the cheaper is this you

608
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:54,460
can buy so make up yes this work very

609
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:56,830
well because all the makeup sit TV the

610
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:00,870
system cheat the system don't identify

611
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:03,970
the the no song identify the cheek and

612
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,770
this work very well there are no cameras

613
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,859
not identify you but all the guys

614
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:12,550
remember you yeah

615
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:16,180
all the people remember and this is our

616
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:18,910
takeaways for you today the fair is open

617
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:22,210
source intelligence must include video

618
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,700
processing okay it's an important data

619
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,580
source ok we have a great

620
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,439
state-of-the-art we have a lot of tools

621
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,009
we have a lot of technology and if you

622
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,250
are free just you can buy a horse mask

623
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,250
like us

624
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:57,069
this is dangerous but this funny we can

625
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:58,809
answer the question with a mask okay so

626
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:00,910
that's all guys thank you very much

627
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:07,219
yeah if you have questions

628
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:07,219
[Applause]
