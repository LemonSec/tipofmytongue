1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,200
right let's kick this off I'm Jeff Moss

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:09,210
and I'm here with a panel and so this is

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,049
what we call the LOC note session it is

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,470
a unique blackhat innovation thanks to

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,960
Steve Wiley and Steve Oldenburg who

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,259
cooked up this idea it's part of a trick

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,619
to get you all to stay longer and it's

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,960
working and so the idea of a lock note

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,390
is to have more of a conversation

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,559
between some of the review board members

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,700
and some audience members we definitely

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,269
go into a question and answer session

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,739
later on so it's not just us talking

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,260
amongst each other at some point

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,788
you get to talk and ask us questions get

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,769
our opinions and the idea is sort of I

17
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,120
always notice that when there's a bunch

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,090
of us sitting around we're having beers

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,169
who are at the bar afterward people

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,760
would always come together on these they

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,710
want to hear what sort of the experts

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,329
are talking about and just listen in

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,190
like well what do we talk about in our

24
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,989
spare time and it turned out that a lot

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,880
of people at the con were interested too

26
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,158
so we structured this sort of as a

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,070
conversation you might not agree with

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,630
one part of it but I've got a list of

29
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,630
you know several topics and we're gonna

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,890
go through them all and we don't

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,119
necessarily all agree with each other

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,040
and then hopefully you'll learn

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,759
something and we'll learn from each

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,590
other and then we'll go to Q&A so today

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:32,220
we've got all the way on stage right

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:36,210
Veronica Valero's got Daniel Cuthbert

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,759
and Antonio's atlases before we get

38
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,380
started I'd like to introduce one of our

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,110
sponsors that are making the whole

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,789
conference possible Phil Marshall with

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,290
security scorecard is going to say a

42
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,630
couple of notes and then we're gonna

43
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,950
jump right into the conversation so come

44
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,420
on up so thank you I'm so impressed with

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,250
the crowd here I can't believe it

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,049
this Israel it really impressive and I'm

47
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,240
just standing between you and a very

48
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,939
interesting session but I wanted to

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,310
first of all just thank everyone in the

50
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,519
room here for your wonderful questions

51
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,619
down in the exhibit floor I can speak

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,720
for security scorecard but also for

53
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,069
several other vendors that I spoke to I

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,349
think at

55
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,798
this event especially above any other

56
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,780
events if we're paying attention we're

57
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,540
creating better products because of your

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,150
questions and the depth of those

59
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,980
questions but I also wanted to sort of

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,859
give my observation or a couple

61
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,530
observations from this show and as you

62
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,239
might notice I have a few gray hairs so

63
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,870
I've been to a few of these and what's

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,239
changed and my key observation is the

65
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,079
audience this used to be an event that

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,319
was largely very technical folks and

67
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:53,639
what we're seeing now is a combination

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,969
of suits and technical and both

69
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,879
audiences are valuable to us to talk to

70
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,219
but I also think what's changed and has

71
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,810
changed for our company and other

72
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,668
companies that is that we're paying more

73
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,780
attention to things like user interface

74
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:12,629
user experience because we know that

75
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,120
part of your job has changed because

76
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:18,060
it's no longer security as a function

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,870
but it's security as a practice that

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,379
informs not only your company's profile

79
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,540
but also your company's valuation it's

80
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,970
changed to that level and I think that

81
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,759
is a key observation that many of us on

82
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,250
the floor are making now that part of

83
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,369
your job is not only talking about

84
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,889
security but talking about security to

85
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,169
your board and to your c-level and

86
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,530
that's that's not an easy challenge and

87
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:50,239
we realize that so we just want to again

88
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,530
thank you for your contribution to

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,519
hopefully a better user experience for

90
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,370
all of the titles and different user

91
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,379
users within your organization we hope

92
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,930
to do a better job and continue to do so

93
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,780
so thanks again appreciate it and look

94
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,680
forward to a great session thank you all

95
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,439
right everybody let's get this started

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,070
so I think I figure there's a pretty

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,969
thinks open-ended question though how

98
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,949
what are we what do you think as a

99
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:24,990
community as security experts what are

100
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,250
we winning that what do we do really

101
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,740
well

102
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,760
and also what do we do well I mean we've

103
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,470
been in some of us have been in this

104
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,630
game for decades and we seem to be

105
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,390
facing the same problems over and over

106
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,040
and over like what's going on and so I'm

107
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,780
gonna I want to throw it off to Daniel

108
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,610
first we're really good at breaking

109
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,909
stuff yeah we're really good at breaking

110
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,410
stuff you really crap at fixing stuff

111
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,950
yeah I think we're struggling the moment

112
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,720
I turn to earlier breach fatigue the

113
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,219
isn't a day that goes by where you don't

114
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,360
hear of another breach and you start to

115
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,520
wonder especially you've been doing it

116
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,740
this would be my third decade nearly

117
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,630
like if we've got all the tools and the

118
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,950
products and the people why is it still

119
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,080
so easy to hack and it's almost

120
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,060
embarrassing for me because you know we

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,039
are trying to fix it we have built

122
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,620
standards as great people out there but

123
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,110
we just really bad at communicating how

124
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,270
to make this stuff secure or is it

125
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,190
securing stuff is just not sexy it's

126
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,180
easy to get a roof shell which is quite

127
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:24,540
sexy so but is it is it more like we're

128
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,910
sucking less yeah like we could suck

129
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,640
more yeah we're sucking less yeah and

130
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,370
also it's reducing the sukkah tude yeah

131
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,930
we are definitely suck or lesser yeah

132
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,900
and that's probably a skillset and

133
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,120
LinkedIn soon I suck a letter maybe not

134
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,250
but yeah I I don't think it's as bad as

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
it was in the 90s because that was just

136
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,770
awful and then the early 2000s with web

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,510
apps that was also really bad um but

138
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,729
we're just we're not where we should be

139
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,330
so but imagine you're in I don't know

140
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,190
automotive safety and you've got airbags

141
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,539
and you've got anti-collision systems

142
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,070
and you've had safety belts and you've

143
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,320
got all this stuff and you still have

144
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,880
automotive fatalities right is that

145
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,620
where we're gonna get to there's just a

146
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,350
sort of acceptable amount of damage and

147
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,810
we have to be okay with that or does our

148
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,620
mentality tell us no zero zero breakin

149
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,060
zero breach fatigue that post but maybe

150
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,950
that's done to the nature of who we are

151
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,840
we want everything to be that Unicorn

152
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,219
yeah maybe we were just really better

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,679
admitting you're never gonna get the

154
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,870
Unicorn you know it will always be said

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:34,830
about what do you think well I know that

156
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,210
most of us are quite optimistic and I

157
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,530
want everything to be reduced down to

158
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:43,039
zero but huemul it is not possible

159
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,500
I agree that the level of Defense has

160
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,550
increased over the years on the other

161
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,400
hand who can still see same attacks over

162
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,620
and over again for instance in this so

163
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,669
had at least three Kenda related attacks

164
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,280
yeah

165
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,470
the topic is quite old what's the

166
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,559
difference then have we failed I believe

167
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,600
not it's a fact that wound reduce better

168
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,410
defenses but we have more sophisticated

169
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,150
attacks from the other hand so the whole

170
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,570
game goes when it goes on over and over

171
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:18,590
and over again now salute it at some

172
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:21,860
point that will face this kind of

173
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,780
attacks I don't know what you see but

174
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,080
certainly things are getting better and

175
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,809
better

176
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,940
so ok so that's what we're good at or is

177
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:34,790
that what we're bad at well depends the

178
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:36,650
perspective yeah you can say both I mean

179
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,480
I said I'd say damn we're really good at

180
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,549
breaking stuff I mean a new technology

181
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,030
comes out and we're all over it really

182
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,610
quickly but then it seems like we move

183
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,880
on to the new shining and is it because

184
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,490
it's not really our job to fix it like

185
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,380
we didn't produce the thing we didn't

186
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,630
build the operating system that can bus

187
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,850
whatever we're just sort of like these

188
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,430
tourists speculating on all the problems

189
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:06,020
but it unless the manufacturer fixes

190
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,760
their thing all we can do is and so is

191
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,530
that maybe why we we point out problems

192
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,510
and move on because we're not in a

193
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,469
position to fix it I think I think

194
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,380
previously the industry was very slanted

195
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,300
to making rock stars of breakers and I

196
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,710
think unfairly like I've now moved into

197
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,110
another defensive role I still break

198
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,080
stuff but defense is damn hard like

199
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,630
anybody working in blue team or building

200
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,490
and defending like respect because that

201
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,870
is not an easy time I think you turned

202
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,789
it it's easy to sit in your bedroom and

203
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,310
poem stuff but if you're trying to fix

204
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,620
that with risk and compliance and

205
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,968
politics and do we have that Network on

206
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,950
crack yeah we've still got that Network

207
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,020
yeah that's that's hot maybe we're going

208
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,270
to talk about the defense fatigue right

209
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,100
like you're breaking you're alone you're

210
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,520
you're breaking stuff and it's so cool

211
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,830
and then it's like ok let's fix this and

212
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,329
it's not explaining things and they

213
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,760
don't understand or maybe they do but

214
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,709
they don't have budget so maybe you get

215
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,490
one year of waiting to get the budget

216
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:07,640
and then no one wants to fix that it's

217
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,800
kind of really exhausting and at some

218
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,560
point is like why what is the reward

219
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,699
right I'll just drop it on full disclose

220
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,060
your mailing list and move on with my

221
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,399
life and yeah and it doesn't make a

222
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,109
difference like at some point if like

223
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,990
from the defense perspective it's like

224
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,850
if no one cares what should I oh we

225
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,980
don't care right why that's why we are

226
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,529
breaking stuff right we want to make it

227
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,959
better but sometimes it's like it's so

228
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:37,820
exhausting that it's just not worth it

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:41,569
so I've seen a lot of defenders like

230
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,850
burnout because it's like this is just

231
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,649
too much so one of the ways we try to

232
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,080
mitigate burnout I think as we try to

233
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,040
automate a lot of things right so if

234
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,020
you're doing something that's burning

235
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,980
you out to automate it and do the cool

236
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,300
thing are we reaching the limits of that

237
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,980
you know you know I don't think we're

238
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,290
doing in love it seems not not enough I

239
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,260
think there's a lot of manual yeah a lot

240
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,209
of manual stuff yeah so Antonio I had a

241
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,319
we were talking a little bit beforehand

242
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:08,599
so what normally happens is we get

243
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,980
together we float some ideas and then if

244
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,529
we find ourselves actually talking about

245
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,060
it for a while it's like stop right we

246
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,410
have to save this for the room otherwise

247
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,779
we're gonna have the conversation and

248
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,250
you won't get to hear it and Antonio's

249
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,529
brought up a really good point where he

250
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,180
thinks we're maybe not doing so well on

251
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,700
mentoring him yeah and actually to be

252
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,469
honest this topic was brought by

253
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,730
Veronica I guess today during dinner

254
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,670
ahead oh okay

255
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:36,170
yeah and she raised the point that okay

256
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,779
I'm being approached by several young

257
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,149
guys and asking what should do what

258
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,100
should move on and I thought that this

259
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:46,220
was a really good point and the really

260
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,040
good question so I was wondering how can

261
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,839
we mentor young people for instance this

262
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,160
afternoon had a very interesting opinion

263
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:57,020
talk by two Israeli guys about training

264
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,430
teenagers this is one part training of

265
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,850
course but the mentoring serve something

266
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,560
else and in my opinion this is something

267
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,290
that probably will fail as a community

268
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,430
and you need to you need to see how can

269
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,980
probies yeah so so I think that we

270
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,050
should go back to the basics at some

271
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,329
point and get stuck again like start

272
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,389
asking some hard questions and ourselves

273
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:22,459
like for example like we love what we do

274
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,319
but what about the next generation of

275
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:26,388
security professionals they are going to

276
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:28,579
be solving problems that we maybe have

277
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:31,100
no idea how they will look like we don't

278
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:34,279
know what the internet in 50 years would

279
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,740
look like so how are we going what are

280
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,959
we doing right now to make sure that the

281
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,750
people that is joining the field it's

282
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,660
ready for that so there is a lot of lack

283
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,930
of communication like and lack of

284
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,660
mentoring guidance and lack of direction

285
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,609
in the sense of what are the challenges

286
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,009
we are facing right the questions we are

287
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,209
we are doing right now like what are we

288
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,209
gonna do that

289
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,670
what are we bad at like yeah sure would

290
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,500
be when you listening to you - it

291
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,439
reminds me like back back back in the

292
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,170
old school days right before YouTube and

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,240
Google like you had to find a mentor if

294
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,420
you are a hacker you didn't get anywhere

295
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,519
unless you found a mentor hacker who

296
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,410
would help steer you and I remember

297
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,389
spending half my time just trying to

298
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,219
find a mentor and once I found the

299
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:24,110
mentor oh my gosh my life was so much

300
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,310
easier I didn't have to speculate about

301
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,699
everything I actually could ask

302
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,979
questions and we seem to have lost that

303
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,649
yeah yeah and I think it's so crucial

304
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,740
because it's like you can learn about I

305
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,630
don't know pocket analysis but if you

306
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,970
have someone that it can show you the

307
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,420
way it's not a shortcut right you still

308
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,670
have to do the work but if if you have

309
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,339
someone around that will say start here

310
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,699
it's much more easier right so we need

311
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,170
more people kind of willing to pass and

312
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:55,609
I remember I think some people think of

313
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,260
it as like well if I help that person

314
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,389
have a leg up they're gonna take my job

315
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,889
and it's like no there's there's plenty

316
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,370
of jobs for everybody people is

317
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:07,339
desperate for like hiring everyone is

318
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,819
like in two years we will need some many

319
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,550
millions of InfoSec positions so we need

320
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:15,920
to create that it's like the idea that

321
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,510
you don't lose the job you have people

322
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,930
there to help you do your job better

323
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,850
yeah

324
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,589
I'd love to know how many of you in here

325
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,480
have been in this industry for less than

326
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,749
three years show of hands

327
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,209
less than three years that's quite a few

328
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:35,790
yeah we'll turn it around more than ten

329
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:39,899
years and so how many of you have

330
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:42,569
mentored someone else once that sounds

331
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,389
wrong there's a bit that sounds really

332
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:47,670
weird okay

333
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,160
so I think we should need more more of

334
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,868
that like sometimes it's not like oh I'm

335
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,670
mentoring you for five years and

336
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:56,009
spending my life with you listen it's

337
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,860
not about that it's like getting

338
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,929
reaching out and just going to a local

339
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,910
hackerspace and helping out a local a

340
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,889
couple people who have interests right

341
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,449
it's it can be a lot of different things

342
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:10,860
but you're you're giving back and you're

343
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:12,569
helping people find their path so I want

344
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,939
to tie it back a little bit to some of

345
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:16,319
my remarks to opening which was it seems

346
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:20,009
like some of our problems were facing

347
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:23,429
now are sort of tech adjacent they're

348
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:25,529
more social tied to tech and I alluded

349
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,779
to that with I think we've built these

350
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,819
giants a social media platforms and only

351
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,079
now we're starting to realize like hey

352
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,540
there might be some downside to

353
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,099
centralizing all that not from an

354
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,319
attackers perspective we've got all the

355
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,759
eggs in one basket from a regulation

356
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:40,110
perspective you've got all the

357
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,620
regulator's that only have to look at

358
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,569
say five platforms instead of 500 it's

359
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,470
sort of an attractive nuisance that was

360
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:51,870
a byproduct and so I'm curious from the

361
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,910
panel and maybe the audience it does it

362
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,529
feel like the next set of problems were

363
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,629
facing have much more of a social

364
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,850
component whether it's deep fakes or

365
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:02,610
disinformation or synthetic

366
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,720
personalities I saw the talk on that you

367
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,850
know we're gonna be dealing with these

368
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,829
issues that seem to have much more of a

369
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,589
social component does that does that

370
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:12,660
sound right to you or am I just kind of

371
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,549
it my own biases it does and I think for

372
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,509
me that's where I think we as an

373
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,449
industry gonna struggle I mean

374
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:20,249
traditionally hackers are the least

375
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,899
social people in the world they don't

376
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:24,029
like humans we don't wanna talk to you

377
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,279
please don't look at me okay and that

378
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,110
was fine if you would worrying some code

379
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,329
or doing something with hardware but now

380
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,619
you've got to talk to people and that's

381
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:37,949
awkward but you can automate that

382
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:40,559
probably that'd be weird chatbot type

383
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:42,299
thing do you have like 50 pull downs no

384
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,389
mom I'm working right now I don't want

385
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,339
dinner but yeah I think we've now got to

386
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,869
get new skills of how do you deal with

387
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,509
people in all the social stuff that you

388
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:52,049
mentioned and like genuinely we're bad

389
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:54,959
at that

390
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:57,269
really bad it's like or profession kind

391
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,498
of a ball Ryan's like before we were

392
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:03,779
just technical I was enough and then we

393
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:07,709
got to learn to manage others because he

394
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:11,009
was needed and now we need to learn even

395
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:14,248
more like more like politics and socials

396
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:17,309
and stuff funny it's like I don't think

397
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:23,669
we can avoid it like we grow up yeah oh

398
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:26,759
my god damn it well and I think so if we

399
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:28,829
don't do that why don't we just keep

400
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:33,419
talking to our computers right what's

401
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:35,789
the downside fake I think we keep I

402
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,728
think we need to keep a leg on the

403
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:41,939
social part because otherwise like we

404
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:44,579
get to really like serious issues like

405
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:46,589
we get regulated we get regulated and we

406
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,899
don't like it so if you don't like it

407
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,499
you should you have to be involved yeah

408
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:57,539
yeah yeah at least from my perspective

409
00:16:51,499 --> 00:17:02,069
yeah any thoughts well certainly the

410
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:04,230
topics it's of interest nowadays and we

411
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:08,869
must deal with this now this brings my

412
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:12,628
mind that talked about diversity

413
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:16,198
before coming here and this is one

414
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:17,819
aspect of diversity be age and social

415
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,600
media for instance are mainly used if

416
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,388
not mistaken by youngest they are more

417
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,188
familiar with this when we are not

418
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:28,758
familiar with something from outside for

419
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:31,470
instance then you may not be able to see

420
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,419
the risks behind it and you may not be

421
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,090
able of course to face or fix them or

422
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,009
help someone to fix them so this is

423
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,709
maybe an come back to work or previous

424
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:42,960
topic that one more reason to suit right

425
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,570
in order to train young people in order

426
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,780
to face these things sense of trying to

427
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,980
face this thing somehow

428
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,629
oh I'm from a different generation and

429
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,790
or maybe the flip side like I have no

430
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,170
idea what a youtuber is like I'd never

431
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,690
thought you can make a career especially

432
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,140
gazillions like they do becoming a

433
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,610
youtuber and that's a social thing and

434
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,730
genuinely we'd be terrible youtubers

435
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,290
does it be a black screen with us maybe

436
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,390
mom have you seen have you seen some of

437
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,920
our friends who have twitch channels hey

438
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,650
if you'd like to watch me reverse i'll

439
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,930
be on twitch like oh yeah I'll jump

440
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,750
right on that why don't you fight Ida

441
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:23,590
for three hours yeah oh look he's loaded

442
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,600
a debug module but you know yeah we'd be

443
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,669
bad at that that's nature but that this

444
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,889
next generation is really good at that

445
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:33,010
like fair play time my kids watch this

446
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,300
one guy called blippi and blippi does

447
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,960
these amazing things he jumps around

448
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:40,000
with orange glasses and get me teza he's

449
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,070
an ex u.s. fighter pilot who's making

450
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,780
four and a half million a year John and

451
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,450
around with the edge being an ass on

452
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,180
YouTube alike respects like to die I

453
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,710
never do that but they seem to be better

454
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:55,630
at becoming more social which so so that

455
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,060
kind of I want to use that as an awkward

456
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,270
transition so have you noticed like I

457
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,909
think within the last year Google switch

458
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,580
preference ranking preference from

459
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,170
desktop to mobile so all of a sudden I

460
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,179
get all these emails is the website

461
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,670
administrator for Def Con saying hey

462
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,750
just so you know we're now

463
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,690
preferentially ranking mobile scores

464
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,180
over desktop scores like okay that makes

465
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,880
sense there's more more mobile use and I

466
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,860
look at like who's viewing our site with

467
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,680
what platforms everybody in China is on

468
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,449
mobile so basically our future is mobile

469
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,850
everything's gonna have to have a mobile

470
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,730
component if you want to be relevant and

471
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,370
so I was wondering okay does that mean

472
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,800
we get to be more secure these mobile

473
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,439
though you're in the walled garden of

474
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:45,340
Apple or Android and is a byproduct we

475
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,950
might just our nice overlords might make

476
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,959
these more secure platforms for us right

477
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,550
as a by-product like we've moved just by

478
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,000
avoiding the problem long enough we've

479
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,770
ended in this garden of - yep well one

480
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,840
cuz let's be honest androids never gonna

481
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,559
get secure really we've tried that

482
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,279
battle

483
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,230
for buy some product manager on on

484
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:09,299
Twitter saying he spent three months on

485
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:11,649
the problem and it was fixed now no

486
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,120
Apple yeah I mean like Fairplay to Apple

487
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:16,029
I think what they've done is nothing

488
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,158
short of phenomenal like a modern iPhone

489
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,649
and iOS is an incredibly secure device

490
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,960
and you know I tear it apart and I look

491
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:24,459
at the hard and I go wow like that's

492
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,620
what happens when you've got a budget of

493
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,080
X and they've hired some of the best

494
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,239
people I've ever known and I'm sure you

495
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,840
can all agree like an iPhone is solid

496
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,789
Android different path I guess they want

497
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,869
coverage and that makes really hard you

498
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,490
know if you want to get on every single

499
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:42,039
hardware device it's not gonna work

500
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:45,129
maybe at a point like we bypass that

501
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:48,129
ugly period of desktop which was just

502
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:49,748
bad yeah yeah I'm just kind of wondering

503
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:52,779
what does that entail for our industry

504
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:54,129
and so you've pushed the attackers up

505
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,899
the stack you have to be really good and

506
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:57,189
so what are the attacks now against

507
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:59,889
mobile we were we were talking earlier

508
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,129
like is it down to somebody has to set

509
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:05,379
up a fake base station somebody has to

510
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,908
have a zero-day on a base band I mean

511
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:08,699
it's getting down to a pretty small

512
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:12,759
number of things I have to worry about

513
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,100
well what I wonder is is it's more

514
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,559
secure because it is really secure

515
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,730
because people is not looking at it like

516
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:23,590
Windows is still kind of or wasa still

517
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,350
kind of on the focus and spotlight right

518
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,840
so there was like thousands of people

519
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,240
looking at the security and trying to

520
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,090
report vulnerabilities and in mobile

521
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,700
phones I get the sense that yes kind of

522
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,668
we are reporting stuff but it's not as

523
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,889
fast and we are not for example you know

524
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:43,869
us you don't have antivirus you cannot

525
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:47,340
capture your own traffic you basically

526
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:51,039
you have no idea what is going on so I

527
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,649
is more secure so far but in the end I

528
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,049
disagreed like with the review board we

529
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:59,559
can see the waves that happen a year and

530
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:01,629
a half ago like we saw a massive drop in

531
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,369
anything to do with mobile mostly

532
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:05,168
because of political pressure and China

533
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,509
saying you shall not released your

534
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:10,149
research now traditionally you see a

535
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,250
good amount of Android oday coming in to

536
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,860
submissions you know

537
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:17,100
and what's really bad we'd rarely get

538
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,090
IOS like genuinely this year's been a

539
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,790
little bit different there's been some

540
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:24,929
good RS but if you look at say a exploit

541
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:27,240
for latest iOS or iPhone no NSO are

542
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,130
dropping 50 million to our friends in

543
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,680
the Middle East like you know a good

544
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,170
Aussie and iOS is still a million plus

545
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,430
there are people looking it's just yeah

546
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,930
that really raised that cost so why

547
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,640
release it at a show when you're gonna

548
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,680
get one to two million dollars for it

549
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,750
exactly you know so the market pressures

550
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,880
driven it up to such it but for Android

551
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,040
you can still get them yeah because the

552
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,640
price isn't so high yeah it's it's the

553
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,580
Walmart of the phone you know yeah yeah

554
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,020
so I'm wondering then does that that

555
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,179
creates sort of like two tiers two

556
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,730
classes of users like I don't

557
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,890
necessarily like iOS but I absolutely

558
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:05,100
have to use it like I have no choice

559
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,380
right I can't have an insecure or less

560
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,540
secure phone so I have to give up all

561
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,940
these cool features that I'm I liked on

562
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,470
my Android but I don't have a choice and

563
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,210
so when you look at your friends it's

564
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,080
like they're all using iPhones because

565
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,910
they prioritize security over blinky and

566
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,699
it really sort of creates two classes of

567
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,920
the population which is weird it's not

568
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,930
supposed to be like that so I spent a

569
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,410
lot of time in Brazil and Brazil still

570
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:35,760
uses a lot of Android for Android for

571
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,860
4.4 yeah which was great you know if you

572
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,180
need to do lots of nasty stuff but

573
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,649
genuine ease because they can't afford

574
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,510
to upgrade and that's an awful problem

575
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,250
because most the handsets that there are

576
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,980
riddled with malware like it's it's the

577
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,180
desktop from the early 2000 yeah they

578
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,220
can't afford to upgrade and I think

579
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,960
that's quite a bad position because by

580
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,040
nature they're now punished for not

581
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,520
having good security because they can't

582
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,530
afford it

583
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:02,550
yeah okay so I've got I've kind of got a

584
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,590
funny side thing which was topics you

585
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,450
alluded to earlier we the review board

586
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,860
sees hundreds and hundreds of hundreds

587
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,230
submissions dorothea over probably over

588
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,469
a thousand are more considering all the

589
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,080
conferences so you get to see trends and

590
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,800
so I was asking them earlier like

591
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,678
remember we used to hear a lot about

592
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,159
Canaries and virtualization and honey

593
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,450
pots and deception services and I was

594
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,900
going through looking at the talks and

595
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,550
the least the

596
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,180
talks I listen to where their attackers

597
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,460
I never heard one speaker say and then I

598
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,280
check for the canary then I evade the

599
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,230
deception system it's like it's not even

600
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,300
was that a speed bump was that something

601
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,520
that had a lot of promise but it's not

602
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:45,290
just didn't come to who here uses

603
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,290
deception services on your network

604
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:57,629
Canaries two three four I'd love to know

605
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,389
why like what's going on there it sounds

606
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,240
so cool but it's not so you had a Dan

607
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,400
you had a speculation of your sprinkled

608
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,010
landmines all throughout your yeah I

609
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,050
mean like as an ex attacker like if you

610
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:12,510
breach a network you go for the juicy

611
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,360
stuff right but as a defender like we

612
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,980
suck at basics we have no idea what we

613
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,840
have and you look at any of the breaches

614
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,850
it was always that struts bucks or prim

615
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,889
face or something else the moment you

616
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,350
throw deception tech on there we've now

617
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,940
got four networks so then you have IT

618
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,409
trying to patch the deception Network

619
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,810
because I think it's outdated that I

620
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,910
already know and the Sox having no idea

621
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,520
like yes it's an overhead nightmare I'd

622
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,890
love to know why it's like three people

623
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,020
using it like that that is I didn't

624
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,170
expect that

625
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:45,150
and we also because of law issues of

626
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,700
regulation issues because for some

627
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,350
organizations for instance having this

628
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,940
kind of deceiving services may not be

629
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,889
allowed it oh I hadn't thought of that

630
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,870
or their regulatory are their regulatory

631
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,080
requirement but why are you not using

632
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,310
this kind of technology I'm wondering

633
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,389
anybody throw something else yeah so

634
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,770
what are some of the other things though

635
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,200
that we've come across that you

636
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,330
mentioned the fall in Android zero day

637
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,010
what are some of the other things you

638
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,600
finally surprising when you well

639
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,300
surprise me I wouldn't say but clearly

640
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,830
on this so that is okay not it's not you

641
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,659
know but there was a clear trend on

642
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,429
using machine learning core most of for

643
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,410
everything learning everywhere

644
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:23,070
yes exactly please stop the machine yeah

645
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:25,530
about there were five talks presented in

646
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:30,179
the show dealing with network defense

647
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:33,300
was aa seed with simulating attackers

648
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:36,210
was a lot of stuff and I remember many

649
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,000
many more submitted in order to present

650
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,790
it so there's clearly NF

651
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,890
to use machine learning for everything

652
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:45,889
conservative is it the new blockchain

653
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,380
yes and AI because AI blockchain helps

654
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,930
machine learning along with the cuantos

655
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,060
remember the quantum yeah but the point

656
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,300
is machine learning itself not only is

657
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:58,790
not new but I have seen this story

658
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,290
repeated now because I recall from my

659
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,690
early days when I was dealing mainly

660
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,250
with networks there was then an effort

661
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,530
to build machine learning for network

662
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,630
elated problems in ideas it was all

663
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,610
about contouring and yeah but I did

664
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,650
still here what is machine learning in

665
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,929
the networks yeah so I'm wondering

666
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,710
eventually all this strength that we

667
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:20,840
face nowadays regarding machine learning

668
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:23,200
will have any real effect will have any

669
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,020
products that they will stay there even

670
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,460
in the same level as ideas I mean that

671
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:33,980
to use to be you somehow or they will

672
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:36,350
vanish I am here I think we we even went

673
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,790
farther because most of the talks were

674
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:43,070
like deep learning

675
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:45,770
so that's deeper right but I'm another

676
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:49,100
effect that I notice is that these

677
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,440
generated like division like people

678
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,510
poaching for machine learning thumbs up

679
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,910
and then people hate anything this

680
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,410
doesn't work don't sell may smoke right

681
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,350
people like Daniel saying I want

682
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,810
superficial learning not that i don't

683
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,689
just don't learn anything just do the

684
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,940
basic side but i think like we are

685
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,090
making a mistake and i think that i

686
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,520
think there is a topic that just keeps

687
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,730
coming that is coming back to the basics

688
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,070
right machine learning is great because

689
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,170
right now we have a lot of data and it's

690
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,870
good at looking at a lot of data but you

691
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:26,870
still need humans that as a machine how

692
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:29,030
to work how to learn what to learn so we

693
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:32,300
are needing analyst to keep the input

694
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:35,180
and we should not SPECT deep learning to

695
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:39,020
do anything extraordinary because you

696
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,900
know we are still not there and again

697
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:46,060
like we are still fail falling in like

698
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:49,919
phishing scams and macros attacks and

699
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:52,889
iot opened the net ports so

700
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,009
we need to kind of I think slow down I

701
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:59,309
wonder if I'm wondering if we're over

702
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:01,110
not over specializing but I think we're

703
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,769
over specializing to a certain degree

704
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,870
in the sense that do you have enough

705
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:09,179
time to understand all the various

706
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,340
permutations of ml and AI and is it an

707
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,289
expert system and is it a and then all

708
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,049
the other tech I mean there's so much

709
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:17,639
going on in our space not no one can

710
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,200
keep it all in your head so that means

711
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,939
you have to be part of a team and then

712
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,490
you have to have divisible skills

713
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,019
amongst the team and then and it goes

714
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,799
back to sort of the fatigue question

715
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:31,259
where I try to protect the DEF CON

716
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,690
Network I spend a lot of time on that

717
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:35,779
and I can tell you over the last five

718
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,889
years it has gotten monumentally more

719
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,450
complicated like to run a web server

720
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:41,519
five years ago was pretty straight

721
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,879
forward now I've got to deal with DNS

722
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,950
second OCSP revocation and key pinning

723
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:48,719
and it goes on and on and on that's and

724
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,970
then the DNS server used to be one file

725
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,799
now I have to deal with everything has

726
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,539
gotten more complicated and so it's like

727
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,820
I'm doing the basics turning a webmail

728
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,039
and thing but I'm spending like three

729
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,019
times as much effort doing it because we

730
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,658
just keep layering on more and more

731
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,519
technology and we're kind of standing so

732
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,009
it's like the other sciences for

733
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,080
instance in medicine

734
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:12,870
you must have expertise on something you

735
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,389
can not have a or doctors do not be a

736
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,090
doctor and you can cure everything yeah

737
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:20,039
you have specialities right so probably

738
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:22,019
were leading we're as well in the cyber

739
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,610
science that we need you need to be

740
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,830
expert in a very very specific topic

741
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,269
which becomes narrower and narrower all

742
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,730
the time right and the whole team

743
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:30,929
eventually will defend the castle so I'm

744
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,000
wondering in the old days you could

745
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,919
defend with four or five people now I

746
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,659
need 20 people the joke is just to

747
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,669
understand the JavaScript executing on

748
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:41,070
my webpage I know that's that's a team

749
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:43,799
of 50 just to do JavaScript yeah that's

750
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,629
not beanie bushes that's the mess yeah

751
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,269
and so we do that because it helps our

752
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:49,439
careers you're the guy that's the expert

753
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:51,779
in this one little problem

754
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,360
but that means we have less generalists

755
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:58,019
so raise your hands if you consider

756
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,149
yourself a generalist okay raise your

757
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,549
hands if you have gotten by being a

758
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:04,229
specialist

759
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:05,429
well less specialist than I thought why

760
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:13,350
do you sell right what's the rest of you

761
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:16,080
then you break is so I'm wondering is

762
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,699
that do you see that there's a lack of

763
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,928
generalists that see bigger pitchers

764
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:26,460
that might be needed for this new social

765
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:28,919
requirement or we need both yeah but we

766
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,230
need both but what we have I don't think

767
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,070
we have enough generalists out there

768
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,559
like from my perspective I see a lot of

769
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,250
people really specializing really fast

770
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,350
like most of the young people they just

771
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:46,320
go straight out of school to like

772
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:49,830
reversing some malware a really specific

773
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,559
model right and you talk about other

774
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:56,309
stuff in general info second they kind

775
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:59,730
of not know it right so why is that and

776
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:02,220
how that will make your work better like

777
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:05,159
like it's something missing that we are

778
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,629
not seeing it's like the the malware

779
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,129
thing the Stephanie middles trend and

780
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:09,840
lost five years like if you want to get

781
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:11,969
into our IT circuits its Mel with Mel

782
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,678
reverse engineering but there's an extra

783
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,750
attacker like the malware is just that

784
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,759
small part it's it's something I'm gonna

785
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,049
drop to get somebody to do something and

786
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,700
then I'm raping pillaging the rest of

787
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,168
the network but I need networking skills

788
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,059
app skills all that kind of stuff but I

789
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:27,000
worry that the concentration of malware

790
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,928
and learning Ida or anything else it's

791
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,970
like you're forgetting about the fact

792
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,860
that it's a bigger picture yeah and

793
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,620
there is a lot of other jobs out there

794
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:39,269
that people yeah I'm looking for right

795
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:41,250
of the field and and I think that people

796
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:43,139
do not understand that being a

797
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,299
journalist means that you can look and

798
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:47,250
solve the problem in a different way

799
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,470
with more knowledge and more specific

800
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,210
and you can also get better at the

801
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,549
basics right like I'm seeing a lot of

802
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,830
Marvel oh cool I have more to reverse

803
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:58,350
but does bands like something in my

804
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,029
network that is not working um you know

805
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,699
we need more of mainframe how many

806
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:07,110
people here work with mainframes it's

807
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,669
one time keeping a real read there

808
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,990
guarantee jobs for life because contain

809
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,519
you know we can never get rid of a bit

810
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,230
like telnet telnet

811
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,350
it is the cockroach of the IT industry

812
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,110
yeah

813
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:19,330
survived everything in which it's still

814
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,668
hit well and if you look at the history

815
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:24,460
of where FTP came from right it predates

816
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,470
TCP yeah right it's like you can never

817
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,570
get rid of it I'm at yesterday tweeted

818
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,350
somebody mom I was using FTP tohc and

819
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:36,730
they're like can't kill that Arthur

820
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:38,649
so yeah going back to review board stuff

821
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,500
also talked a little bit about I've

822
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,779
noticed diversity of people submitting

823
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,350
right there seems to be more

824
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:49,090
international more Asian and some of the

825
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,129
Japanese submissions have just been

826
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,259
killing it lately it's it's so

827
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,610
traditionally you had a lot of you don't

828
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:56,620
have the circuit people submitting the

829
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:59,709
same color thing and especially for the

830
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,850
USA and here last two years like there

831
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,909
are people you've never heard of but

832
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:06,309
they're talks they like amazing so this

833
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,960
traditionally Japan has always been very

834
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:11,440
quiet in the global research world like

835
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,179
it's maybe one every couple years this

836
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,129
year like wow what has happened and

837
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:17,879
there have been some phenomenal talks I

838
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:20,770
mean I went and had a full man gasm with

839
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,359
the pastor talk cuz I'm like great

840
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,550
research amazing problem solved

841
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,250
well-built I'm like that's solid

842
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,750
researching and engineering there's that

843
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,969
there's a lot of other countries you've

844
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,379
never really expected anything for now

845
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,209
pushing stuff through so I think the

846
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:35,739
balance is definitely tipped it's it's

847
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,589
now very much a global research

848
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,959
community than just UK us Germany yes

849
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:43,119
Island yeah and I think that diversity

850
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,429
is great and I think it also relates

851
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,669
with this new generation of

852
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,869
professionals right we are seeing like

853
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:52,060
researchers presenting top-notch

854
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:52,929
research like really young like oh

855
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,839
that's great

856
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:57,790
like some people some years I will

857
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,100
complain like oh we got the conference

858
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,259
is all the same people

859
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,600
anymore not only moron we were wondering

860
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,610
what is the young people right where are

861
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,410
the submissions and now we can see them

862
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,960
well Steve and I were having a chat and

863
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,210
gentlemen if he's in the room came up it

864
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,400
was his first submission to blackhat

865
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,320
it was on Windows kernel protection like

866
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,390
a solid topic this was the first time

867
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,520
he's ever submitted to a conference him

868
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,319
his family so proud his gym teacher was

869
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,390
proud his grandparents are proud from

870
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,220
Russia I'm like respect like this is

871
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,319
your first consummation and this is a

872
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,029
solid solid subject like you are

873
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,740
protecting the Windows kernel like

874
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:38,080
that's that's amazing that's your first

875
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:41,080
submission like Jesus Wow okay so I have

876
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,190
a final a final kind of common question

877
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,140
and then we gonna move to the audience

878
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:48,610
participation and then we were talking

879
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,170
about log generation and and threat

880
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,240
feeds and how much some of these threat

881
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,610
feeds cost and how actionable is the

882
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,379
intelligence is actually useful and I

883
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,360
was joking it's like well I get attacked

884
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,790
all the time how do i monetize my logs

885
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,590
can I make some money it's like we

886
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,330
should all pull together I think we'll

887
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:08,770
start a new business I'll call it new co

888
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:10,390
you send me all of your logs I'll find

889
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,040
somebody to buy them all and we'll share

890
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,850
all the money and it'll be like the

891
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,279
blackhat my beer pool right because like

892
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,380
our logs have got to be just as valuable

893
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,550
as those other peoples lugs I mean how

894
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:26,230
is it any different I look I think if

895
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,020
you look at people who are targeted a

896
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,150
lot like that stuff golden it's not just

897
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,100
some random box and Romania's you know

898
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,080
who wouldn't want to pop you yeah like

899
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,500
the star gonna be worth at least 10

900
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:44,799
beers

901
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:47,050
exactly yeah but I think that um

902
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,200
the discussion on that intelligence log

903
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:53,020
is like I think there are these pipes

904
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,569
right all thread intelligence all feeds

905
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:59,830
or machine learning or blockchain uh

906
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:02,140
it's not talk about that but and we we

907
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,970
really need to be more critical we

908
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,950
really need to ask the hard question is

909
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,899
this useful it's like where's the

910
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:10,029
scientific analysis that shows that your

911
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,340
beads actually there was this great talk

912
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,750
during these two days doing a really

913
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,530
nice comparison

914
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:20,260
so it was like May is more useful to run

915
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:23,380
my honeypotted pain a lot of money for

916
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:26,800
is you feed that it after today is not

917
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,500
worth any more right so I think that we

918
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,810
should start like questioning why why

919
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,840
I'm buying this like make them hard to

920
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,700
make them convinced here like show me

921
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,170
the numbers right but that was always

922
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,509
one of the things like the early hacking

923
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,310
days was question or we verify

924
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,650
everything and I think we've lost a lot

925
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,509
that we trust a lot of oh yeah I guess I

926
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,290
must do that you know blockchain will

927
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,180
fix everything

928
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:52,000
how many Bitcoin millionaires are in the

929
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,669
moon and that is awkward and I think

930
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,850
that we all know this is hype but let's

931
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:00,460
buy it just in case it works right so no

932
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,620
we should kind of ask the questions

933
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,270
before before that okay let's go to some

934
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,670
questions raise your hand we've got a

935
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,810
microphone on either side of the room

936
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:13,150
okay it looks like this side is winning

937
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:15,509
the site is snoozing so you all said we

938
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:19,690
need to improve our social political

939
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:21,100
procedural skills and that's something I

940
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,840
mean learning those soft skills takes a

941
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,400
lot of time and mentoring people to know

942
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,120
those soft skills takes a lot of time

943
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,040
and we all know that the mentors and the

944
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,319
people that are being mentored are too

945
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,600
short in time which means it'll come at

946
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,800
the cost of learning technical skills at

947
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,120
least to a certain extent so at the same

948
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,710
time you've said that I've heard a lot

949
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,990
of we need to improve our technical

950
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,030
skills so where's the balance I mean we

951
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,220
can't do everything I'll take a crack at

952
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:50,740
that first which is I think you can't

953
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:53,020
you can't be all things to everybody

954
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,459
right and people do have natural

955
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,100
affinity some people are better at

956
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,300
certain skills and others and so I would

957
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,160
say if you

958
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,620
if you are somewhat technical but you

959
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,600
lean more toward the soft skills maybe

960
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,750
that's your maybe that's your rollin

961
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,310
InfoSec right don't try to be a howl of

962
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,200
our reverse-engineering

963
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,090
if you know you can't be at that level

964
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,620
of game you know put your energy into

965
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,970
where you'll be most effective right

966
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,950
you'll get the best wins you'll be the

967
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:20,080
most helpful to your organization and so

968
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,060
the might of it might just be you

969
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,170
reflecting on like where are what are

970
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,810
your strengths and playing To Your

971
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,250
Strengths I don't think we're saying

972
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,259
everybody has to have all these skills

973
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,970
but I think if the industry if we

974
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,470
acknowledge that there is a role for

975
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,529
those skills and those skills are

976
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,540
valuable and they will help us then we

977
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,540
should put some energy thinking about

978
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,650
them I think talk to your question like

979
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,410
when you're starting out in this

980
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:47,320
industry you you have like such a wide

981
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,509
array of things you can do and naturally

982
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,450
you you levitate to what you're good at

983
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,940
well you could be a halvah who has a

984
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,919
god-given gift that just terry stuff you

985
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,420
can be mr. Fitz over there when it comes

986
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,010
to hardware it just falls apart in front

987
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,960
of it but you're not going to do

988
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,910
everything and I think naturally as your

989
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,470
career goes on you go well I'm really

990
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,240
good at I enjoy hardware I understand

991
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,189
how electronics works but put me in

992
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,959
front of Ida and there's just lots of

993
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,120
blue lines and with red I don't know I

994
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,800
did it and then you'd expand upon the

995
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,000
hardware top stuff you shouldn't try and

996
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
do everything so I think you will burn

997
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,950
out really really quickly yeah I want to

998
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,770
add that like 10 years ago we were

999
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:27,220
joining the industry in a different time

1000
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:29,290
like we were not so pressure with time

1001
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,600
and we were like more relaxed I could

1002
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,480
have take a day to learn something right

1003
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,910
now it's like companies want you to be

1004
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,270
productive in three months right and you

1005
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:43,210
are just out of school so I think in

1006
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:45,490
that case like you if you don't take the

1007
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:48,220
time right now to learn it you will

1008
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:51,100
never have the time so you need to okay

1009
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,649
I need one day a week to learn this and

1010
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,060
negotiate right it is your career you

1011
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,670
will be more effective in three years

1012
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,759
like a shalini wait under the next

1013
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,410
question so get some couple in there

1014
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,640
hello

1015
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,180
touching back on the beginning of the

1016
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,848
conversation where

1017
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,270
and we have attackers and defenders and

1018
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:13,520
knotting out so and we trip all for the

1019
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:17,029
same problems all over and over again so

1020
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,299
it seems to me like that like attackers

1021
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:22,549
work is I agree is much sexier and like

1022
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:24,619
at most attackers and defenders I kind

1023
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:26,660
of get the same compensation on the

1024
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,309
market so it seemed don't you think

1025
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,460
there is a disproportion of that there

1026
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,869
are more attackers which

1027
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,839
find problems but there are not enough

1028
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,700
defenders to fix them and if you agree

1029
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,089
like do you think there is a way to fix

1030
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:44,180
it somehow to make a defender position

1031
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:46,430
more sexier yes I'm with definite order

1032
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,799
and review board like we want good

1033
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,799
defensive talks because a they're harder

1034
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:54,619
like I think the day of popping calc on

1035
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:57,259
an internet-connected dildo or well and

1036
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:59,119
truly behind us like move on seriously

1037
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,010
other stunts hacking and yeah stun

1038
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,140
hacking like it has this place sometimes

1039
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,630
but you popped something that shouldn't

1040
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:08,240
be on the internet and like okay so what

1041
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,069
I think defensive talks and we do look

1042
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,598
at that in the review board like this is

1043
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,160
a cool thing you can do and somebody can

1044
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,450
action that on Monday morning and this

1045
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,058
is gonna save a lot of stuff like

1046
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,500
respect but I think the balance is still

1047
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,809
very much in favor of the attackers and

1048
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,549
defense is hard look at hacking team

1049
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:24,410
like they were very good at breaking

1050
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:29,180
stuff and they got popped really badly

1051
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:31,640
up second defense is hard one other

1052
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,609
reason for this disproportion could be

1053
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,950
that an attacker needs to find one

1054
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:38,930
witness one bug in order to break

1055
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,660
something the defender has to defend

1056
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,000
more or less everything he will design a

1057
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,649
protocol the higher level protocol he

1058
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,510
has to examine all the filthy stellitita

1059
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,490
it's much more difficult as a broader

1060
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,470
scope if he forget something

1061
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,750
the attacker can fight it and DM over

1062
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,700
for the defender so I believe this is

1063
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,349
one of the main reasons in addition to

1064
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,930
what you say that it is sexier to be an

1065
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:04,039
adequate this is one more reason that

1066
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:07,160
why have all this attacking style talks

1067
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:11,150
but when I see an attacking style talk

1068
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:14,690
I'd ICS a defender to be honest because

1069
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,460
this help us to make products better to

1070
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,690
improve the cadence of disguise before

1071
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,890
it saturated right if you didn't have

1072
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,210
all this ever freedom tackle

1073
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,670
we wouldn't have all this well that's

1074
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,529
movement the defensive when I've talked

1075
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,660
to some universities I was talking to

1076
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:28,010
one that said we want to be world class

1077
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,859
we want to have the best information

1078
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,900
security program I'm like that's great I

1079
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:35,480
like your enthusiasm you've got budget

1080
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,559
fantastic are you gonna be okay teaching

1081
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:43,640
offense to your students cricket hmm

1082
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,559
maybe we'll be the second best it's like

1083
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,629
there were some hard questions it's like

1084
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,250
they didn't fully realize like to be the

1085
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,170
best you're gonna have to teach offense

1086
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,150
and they couldn't get that past the Dean

1087
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,260
of the school okay we're gonna take a

1088
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,349
question over here and it'll be the

1089
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,779
where the end that's more like

1090
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:02,210
consideration if I step out of the this

1091
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:05,059
kind of community and I think about

1092
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,500
designing a product the perception of a

1093
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,359
company today is that it isn't something

1094
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,549
the market wants it I want to put it on

1095
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:12,200
the market and then we have a cage with

1096
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:15,799
three different level of badges with a

1097
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,990
bunch of dogs which are these technology

1098
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:20,089
people they come out they say I did

1099
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,890
everything wrong so they start doing

1100
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:24,410
thing they correct a patch then

1101
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:26,990
everything they delay my my stuff and

1102
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:30,140
then they go back in the cage so my

1103
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:33,129
feeling is that this we're talking about

1104
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:36,230
social and everything they're not social

1105
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:39,170
we need in my opinion to socialize to

1106
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:41,539
make this technology people more social

1107
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:43,220
to be part of the process but they

1108
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:45,789
haven't started well sure we should put

1109
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,439
them in cages that's a bit hard core

1110
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:49,940
pages might be a bit weird well and I'd

1111
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
say we should socialize the people

1112
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,750
pushing these products out so fast

1113
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,160
because they're doing social harm but

1114
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:59,750
somehow we're the ones to be blamed for

1115
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,828
it doesn't seem right yeah I sort of get

1116
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,660
where you're coming but I think that

1117
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:04,940
there's a balance here I think you know

1118
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,680
it's easy to smack internet of things at

1119
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,950
the moment but at the same time

1120
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,538
consumers demand stuff really cheap

1121
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,098
instantly like there's got to be some

1122
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:15,589
give-and-take well we still have airbags

1123
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:16,910
you still don't get run over yeah yeah

1124
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:19,069
you don't get to buy a car without an

1125
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,660
airbag no that's true okay so we're

1126
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:24,730
winding down on time I want to try one

1127
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,730
last question and then that'll be it so

1128
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:32,109
sorry about that

1129
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,230
so if you notice always spin the last 10

1130
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:37,720
20 years it hasn't really changed

1131
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:40,450
vendors keep on producing products that

1132
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,669
have security vulnerabilities I think

1133
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:45,790
that what we're we're still in the job

1134
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,560
here I guess so I guess developers do

1135
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,630
not learn they will have been spending

1136
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,130
more than 20 years with the same problem

1137
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,470
seeing the same problems over and over

1138
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,840
again but it's not the same developer

1139
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:58,390
certain right you're cranking out new

1140
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:01,390
developers time and time again yeah

1141
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,549
which is a bit strange and I was always

1142
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:05,259
time I was thinking that there will be

1143
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,970
some new regulation that would force

1144
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,010
vendors to actually create more secure

1145
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,689
software but at the moment it seems that

1146
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,480
even from a regulation side the problem

1147
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,520
is being passed down to banks or other

1148
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,760
institutions zero here and everything

1149
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,220
else

1150
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,349
what do you see do you think that we

1151
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,529
will ever hold vendors accountable for

1152
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:27,460
producing crappy software or I mean

1153
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:29,320
that's a long conversation but I'll have

1154
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,840
one one observation if you search for

1155
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:35,170
source code examples almost all of them

1156
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,770
are insecure right so if all you do is

1157
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:40,390
go to your favorite code repository and

1158
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,430
make a comment when you see insecure

1159
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,830
code then the next person to come along

1160
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:46,569
and use that code right might get might

1161
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:50,040
copy and paste the secure version and

1162
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:53,320
I've talked to the people who produce

1163
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,640
books for universities on there's a

1164
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:59,290
couple standards in the United States

1165
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,420
and it's like if I got $300,000 or

1166
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:05,200
whatever and code reviewed every example

1167
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,869
in your text books would you include

1168
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,580
them so that we get examples and it

1169
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:10,960
turns out it's not a 1020 hundred

1170
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,859
million dollar problem we're talking a

1171
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,109
couple hundred thousand dollars to

1172
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:15,549
review code in text books all right so

1173
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:17,710
some of the problems we think are huge

1174
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,920
they're really small we just need to get

1175
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:23,109
people together to do it I'm waiting for

1176
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,240
a backdoor by a stack overflow and a

1177
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:26,619
comic read example yeah how many people

1178
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,020
copy and paste my stack overflow like

1179
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:30,760
yeah I've been the laravel what a pain

1180
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,290
in the arse I remember talking to

1181
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,200
somebody at a major search engine and

1182
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:37,240
they said we you submit us the proper

1183
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,919
code and we're happy to make it the

1184
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,859
number one search result we're just too

1185
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,599
busy to do it so I mean you'll

1186
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,009
that's people in industry are accepting

1187
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,959
you know we'll accept some of our

1188
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:50,259
examples it's just we don't we have not

1189
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:52,058
organized as a community to do that and

1190
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:55,660
sometimes there are developers that they

1191
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:58,029
want to cook sick do secure coding but

1192
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:01,269
they don't have time because you know

1193
00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:04,059
deadlines so I think it's like um it's

1194
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:07,238
like a balance like but try keep pushing

1195
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:10,630
and keep trying to educate your bosses

1196
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:11,890
to kind of accept that as well all right

1197
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,329
well thank you very much for sticking

1198
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,609
around for the lock note and thank you

1199
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:16,869
for making just a really good black hat

1200
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:20,009
hope to see you next year

1201
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:20,009
Thanks see you guys around

1202
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,369
[Applause]
