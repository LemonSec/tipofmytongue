1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
cool awesome thanks everybody for

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,230
attending our session today we're both

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,910
super excited to be up here and to be

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,740
sharing some of our research into the

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,019
Syrian electronic army and their mobile

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,650
surveillance tool that we call

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,150
SilverHawk so first off who are we my

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,009
name is Michael Foster and I head up

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,198
workouts threat intelligence team and

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm joined on stage by Chris and Dale

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,359
Rosa who is a security intelligence

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,849
analyst in the Intel team as well and

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,210
we've got the really exciting and

14
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,250
interesting job of researching mobile

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,469
malware and a really interesting subset

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,019
of that that is surveillance where so

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,410
our goal is focused on understanding not

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,899
only how these tools work but also you

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,690
know who created them for what purpose

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,860
we're in the world about deploying them

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,649
what are the attack vectors that they're

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,449
using and how successful are they so in

23
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,660
a lot of cases will obviously look into

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,010
infrastructure and try and identify

25
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,019
whether there have been any operational

26
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,750
security mistakes made that allow us to

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,489
get an insight into XOR traded data

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,460
that's been stolen from targets of

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,580
interest and we kind of use all this

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,929
information to build out in that context

31
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,369
so you might be familiar with some of

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,680
the families we've reported on in the

33
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,740
past things like Pegasus fire Pratt dark

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,330
caracal stealth mango tan jello and a

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,070
bunch of other names that probably don't

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,990
mate that might not make any sense

37
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,580
unless you're familiar with them if

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,020
you're not check out our blog if mobile

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,579
surveillance where is your jam but for

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,560
this talk we're going to be focusing on

41
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,329
the Syrian electronic army so we'll kick

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,340
things off with just a bit of background

43
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,250
information into who this group is and

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,470
you know how background information

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,040
about them basically before shifting to

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,990
their mobile tools SilverHawk will then

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,820
change things up a bit and talk about

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,548
the attack vectors that this group is

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,679
used to actually deliver this tool and

50
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,180
not only a mobile component but also a

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,340
desktop piece as well as a fishing

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,409
component and then throughout this

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,060
entire talk and the investigative work

54
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,189
that we've done we've come across a

55
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,280
number of different personas that we've

56
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,348
been able to tie back to the Syrian

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,890
electronic army and actually do

58
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,890
attribution

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,510
when it comes to actually identifying

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
interesting malware and surveillance

61
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,409
where there are a number of different

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,209
ways that we can do this one of the ways

63
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,829
that we've had a lot of success is by

64
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,120
actually focusing on regions of the

65
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,959
world where there's a lot of volatility

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,849
and what we what we tend to find is that

67
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,670
when we look at our telemetry in places

68
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:39,089
where there's a lot of political

69
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,458
conflict and tension and security risks

70
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,530
there are often regional players that

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,980
are deploying surveillance where in

72
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,769
conjunction with all that volatility to

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,608
kind of get an edge over their opponents

74
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:56,609
their neighbors or domestic people of

75
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:59,459
interest so with that in mind like

76
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,840
places like China South Korea and Taiwan

77
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,970
Hong Kong these are all interesting

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,010
places for us to continually monitor our

79
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,530
telemetry and see what's you know coming

80
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,840
up and popping up in those regions and

81
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,459
also the Middle East is unsurprisingly a

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,060
really interesting place for us as

83
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,880
researchers to focus our attention so

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,709
over the years in doing this you know

85
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,380
we've we've seen things like fiber art

86
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,109
which was a targeted Mobile's

87
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,040
purely mobile campaign that was running

88
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:31,230
for multiple years and was being pretty

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,450
much deployed purely against the Israeli

90
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,000
defense for us so what we saw in this

91
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,950
case was that members of the military

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,590
were had their devices successfully

93
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,440
compromised by the act of running this

94
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,599
and you know the the operator of this

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,739
campaign was able to get continual

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,048
updates on things like geolocation

97
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,849
coordinates as well as sensitive

98
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,849
information that was on these devices so

99
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,200
pretty successful there and then if we

100
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,418
switch right next door

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,429
same sort of thing in Palestine with a

102
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,590
platform an act of running a

103
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,069
multi-platform campaign against the

104
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,919
government there so deploying desktop

105
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,040
malicious desktop binaries as well as a

106
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,269
mobile component and also phishing

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,940
certain targets of interests so these

108
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,530
are just two examples of some of the

109
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,719
more interesting things that we've

110
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,940
looked at in this region but there are a

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,349
lot of other actors some are financially

112
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,110
focused others are using more

113
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,930
sophisticated tools than these two for

114
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,759
example and

115
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,199
I guess so NSA's bespoke I'm tall so it

116
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,990
makes sense for us to pay a lot of

117
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,419
attention to our data in in this part of

118
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,949
the world yeah and so like Michael said

119
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,169
when we were focusing on that part of

120
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,520
the world it kind of made sense that at

121
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,008
some point something from Syria might

122
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,320
pop up so Syria has been in a civil war

123
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:49,750
since 2011 and before that they've had

124
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,280
decades of political instability the

125
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,639
current President Bashar al-assad

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,258
his regime is known to be very digitally

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,300
oppressive so shutting the internet off

128
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,400
often coinciding when there's protests

129
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,009
filtering web content blocking social

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,239
media and so kind of in conjunction with

131
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,830
a physical fighting it made sense that

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,650
to get an edge over the dissidents there

133
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,300
might be a cyber component and also to

134
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,650
give you kind of an idea of the

135
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,660
landscape that you're in they were

136
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,638
listed Syria it was listed as enemies of

137
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,610
the internet in 2014 by reporters

138
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,440
without borders and then they ranked

139
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,169
177th out of 180 countries on the World

140
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,370
Press Freedom Index so this is kind of a

141
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,560
landscape that you've been in for the

142
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,479
last roughly 1020 years now and then in

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,729
2011 that's when the Syrian electronic

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,229
army officially first formed made their

145
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,760
first website and they're a really

146
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,550
interesting group to researchers because

147
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,469
they are considered one the first

148
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,320
state-sponsored hacking groups so

149
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,430
sponsored by the Assad regime and

150
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,680
they're known to specifically target

151
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,840
those dissidents who are anti Assad and

152
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,240
that means journalists human rights

153
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,159
organizations doctors even and so that's

154
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,139
who is working on this mobile malware

155
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,880
component and so to give you a history

156
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,770
of some of their previous hacks and what

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,690
they perform early did they started with

158
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,580
fairly simple website defacements so

159
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,020
here's some samples where they hacked

160
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,870
Harvard University's website

161
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,849
UCLA's website the kind of standard

162
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,919
protocol was suppose pictures of Bashar

163
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:11,680
and then their logo saying Syrian

164
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,210
electronic army was here after website

165
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,909
the face mints they then pivoted to

166
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,560
Twitter hacks and a lot of them were

167
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,389
mainly successful due to good fishing

168
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,039
attempts and so the Twitter accounts

169
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,560
that they hacked range from news outlets

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,949
to large organizations to weather

171
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,330
stations or sports teams but what they

172
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,830
typically did and how they were

173
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,479
successful was they were able to fish

174
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,250
employees who would have the appropriate

175
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,479
social media credentials and this is

176
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,460
something that we've seen them continue

177
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,349
to do for the past few years now and

178
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,200
it's how they've also been successful

179
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,060
where they take

180
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,620
we are able to fish admins of groups

181
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,930
that they think their targets might be

182
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,640
interested in and post malicious content

183
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,850
as an admin to try and reach like a

184
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:54,500
wider range of potential targets yeah so

185
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:56,030
if we rewind to October 2017 we were

186
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,240
looking at our data in this part of the

187
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,010
worlds and a number of a number of

188
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,520
interesting applications stood out to us

189
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,740
for several reasons first of all when we

190
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,810
looked at them on virustotal they had no

191
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,700
detection x' at the time they definitely

192
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,490
looked to be custom surveillance where

193
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,289
and they didn't appear to be widely

194
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,730
deployed so from what we could tell are

195
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,650
being used in a very targeted fashion

196
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,950
and seeing as that's what we're all

197
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,400
about

198
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,710
we decided to dig a little deeper in

199
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,630
addition to that the applications that

200
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,640
we found this family that we called

201
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,159
SilverHawk inside of who were really

202
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,560
representative of what we see from a lot

203
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,870
of different actors that are deploying

204
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,350
surveillance we're so typically you'll

205
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,480
see things I Trojan eyes or surveillance

206
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,190
where trojan eyes din side of secure

207
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,870
messaging applications killed

208
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,370
connectivity applications and that was

209
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,750
the case here so it definitely kind of

210
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,700
motivated us into pulling this entire

211
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,290
thing apart and pulling on all the

212
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,810
threads and understanding what exactly

213
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:00,080
was going on here so we found SilverHawk

214
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,820
inside of applications like updates for

215
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,750
whatsapp telegram

216
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,180
a number of custom chat applications as

217
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,760
well as a application called chat secure

218
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,310
ultimate 2017 that you could buy for

219
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,039
just under $1,000 or you could enter an

220
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,340
unlock code and we'll get to that a bit

221
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,320
later on as it's kind of related to

222
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:25,460
further work and further tooling by this

223
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,719
route we also found SilverHawk in things

224
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,359
that continue to confuse me as a

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,150
researcher trojan as version of a Flash

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,380
Player update not sure how people are

227
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,539
still getting convinced into installing

228
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,330
that but attackers are still pushing it

229
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,030
out as well as the Trojan I version of

230
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,530
Microsoft Word which sounds pretty

231
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,010
terrible to actually try and use on a

232
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,720
tiny mobile device but given all the

233
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,810
applications that we've seen SilverHawk

234
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,400
in we can kind of say that the threat

235
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,000
actors behind this and the developers

236
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,949
really

237
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,580
favourite Trojan izing updates to

238
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:05,120
whatsapp telegram as well as a system

239
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:07,310
package update so once we had that

240
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
initial thread in October we're really

241
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,900
interested in obviously trying to

242
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,280
identify as many samples as possible

243
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,980
that belong to this family and then

244
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,720
actually conduct you know analysis

245
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,760
around the capabilities but also take a

246
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,850
look at some of the other metadata like

247
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,310
the time stamps and the reason for doing

248
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,020
that is time stamps can be pretty

249
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,390
helpful in a lot of cases in actually

250
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,400
figuring out what time zone a malicious

251
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,900
developer is on which can then you know

252
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,970
feed into attribution later on down the

253
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,209
line in this particular case that wasn't

254
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,490
useful for developer time zones but

255
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,050
looking at the dates of when samples

256
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,950
were actually packaged we don't believe

257
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,829
they were modified or you know tampered

258
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,930
with essentially say once we identified

259
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,970
more samples we could do analysis on

260
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,949
just the dates themselves and get a good

261
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,690
understanding of when these samples were

262
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,400
actually being pushed out into the wilds

263
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,620
when they're being created and get a

264
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,720
better understanding of how this actor

265
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,430
was operating so with that in mind we

266
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,390
can kind of see here that SilverHawk

267
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:11,319
samples first popped up in mid 2016

268
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,910
indicating that this actor had a mobile

269
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,060
surveillance capability from it at least

270
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,770
that point if not earlier we think now

271
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,260
our testing samples out at that stage

272
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,420
before regularly releasing new updates

273
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:29,510
and versions in throughout 2017 or why

274
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:31,339
up until up until present and so in

275
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,140
terms of capabilities and what this what

276
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,220
these applications can do they might

277
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,110
have different icons but they're all

278
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,430
basically the same under the hood and do

279
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,290
what you would expect generic

280
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,050
surveillance wear to do they don't use

281
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,459
any zero-day exploits but kind of a few

282
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,170
interesting things that we can point out

283
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,670
that they do is you know remotely

284
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,140
recording audio so if you can imagine

285
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,459
the implications for political

286
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,890
dissidents who might be in sensitive

287
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,730
meetings or would love the enemy would

288
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,040
love to know what they're talking about

289
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,690
if their phones infected you can just

290
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,939
remotely start recording and stream the

291
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,980
audio out same with remotely turning the

292
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,380
camera on and taking photos as well as

293
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,050
accessing photos videos files that are

294
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,740
already on the phone a unique aspect

295
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,439
that they put

296
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,730
was a survival counter so what happens

297
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,959
is every time there's a connection to

298
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,690
the command and control servers that's

299
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,219
successful it resets to two and then

300
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,380
every time a connection attempt is made

301
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,240
or if the c2 servers down it drops down

302
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,330
by one and then when it finally hits

303
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,310
zero SilverHawk is dormant and then it

304
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,810
gets reset upon rebooting the phone but

305
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,310
this is really good for the threat actor

306
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,020
because a lot of you might know that a

307
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,339
typical sign of compromises if you're

308
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,870
just turning through battery life really

309
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,430
quickly and they've made sure that their

310
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,690
app isn't going to raise suspicions by

311
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,239
just eating through the person's phone

312
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,040
battery so yeah other things you'd

313
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,390
expect it to do it'll hide its icon so

314
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,329
you don't know it's on the phone send

315
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,130
out basic device information and then in

316
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,810
terms of a sample communication that we

317
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,910
saw to one of the command and control

318
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,770
servers this is a packet capture from

319
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,569
one of the earlier samples but they all

320
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,120
kind of operate in the same format where

321
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,070
it starts with Hamza packet you get an

322
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,020
integer command and there's dozens of

323
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,730
them that will show on the next page the

324
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,709
data that will be going out and then a

325
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,420
boolean success if it was successful or

326
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,399
not and then ends with haunt as the

327
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,469
delimiter stock so I don't know if you

328
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,180
can see it but this sample four right

329
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,130
here is talking about command number 17

330
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,380
which is the basic device information

331
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,689
command and so it was able to send out

332
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,700
the IMEI number on the same serial

333
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,610
number if the device is rooted or not

334
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,649
who the carrier is all that information

335
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:30,260
back and here's a few more so 17 was

336
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,959
when we talked about 34 and 35 starting

337
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,490
and stopping that audio recording

338
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,020
throughout the variations of the malware

339
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,779
that we've seen there haven't been too

340
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,370
many variations but the digit or the

341
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,079
command number associated to the certain

342
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,990
command might alter but one thing that

343
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,520
we noted going through the variance of

344
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,680
this malware over the last few years are

345
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,449
the earlier samples were they're all

346
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,189
very basic but the earlier samples just

347
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,630
had the IP address for the command and

348
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,270
control server it's just hard coded in

349
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,160
along with the port number then about a

350
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,870
year ago year and a half ago they tried

351
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,760
to obfuscate the IP address a little bit

352
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,140
so they just removed some digits and you

353
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
did a simple replacement because they

354
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,130
were place like app for a certain number

355
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,260
and then some of the most recent samples

356
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,000
that we saw they obfuscated the IP

357
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,680
address a little bit more and just wrote

358
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,180
some strings backwards even though they

359
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,040
were still in plain text so it was

360
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,719
nothing too complex but we think this is

361
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,069
a good indicator that they've been

362
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,990
seeing a lot of success with these tools

363
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,150
if they haven't

364
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,560
the need to drastically overhaul the

365
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,819
tool that they're working with because

366
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,739
it's been around for a few years now

367
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,480
where there are antivirus products that

368
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,490
will pick it up and so they've only had

369
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,880
to make minor changes to be able to keep

370
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,490
using it successfully yeah so if we go

371
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,960
back to that particular chat scare

372
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,880
elephant application that I mentioned

373
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,250
before that you could unlock for $1,000

374
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,600
you know as you can expect if you put an

375
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,910
application like this in front of a

376
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,900
reverse engineer there they're naturally

377
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,370
not only going to look at their

378
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,030
malicious side of things but also try

379
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,700
and crack it in this case it's basically

380
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,050
a level zero crack meaning so super easy

381
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,600
the activation key is just hiding in

382
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,300
there you can enter it in and it says

383
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,470
you know all your nets are secured with

384
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,079
a smiley face so you know it's

385
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,450
completely legitimate that's all nice

386
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,420
and good but what's interesting is that

387
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,160
that activation code not only unlocks

388
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,170
that out but it also appears in one

389
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,660
other sample that doesn't belong to

390
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,069
SilverHawk so things started to get

391
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,390
interesting for us at this point we're

392
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,980
like oh this is kind of weird there's a

393
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,710
connection to a completely different

394
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,570
family and it turns out that this other

395
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,310
family was the commodity surveillance

396
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,960
tool caught on to wrap that if you're

397
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,609
not familiar with it's essentially the

398
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,470
same it's got a lot of the same sort of

399
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:39,100
capability as a silver wall you can pick

400
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,840
it up on various forums so it's capable

401
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,400
of you know recording audio collecting

402
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:48,670
text messages you know the operator of

403
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,590
the tool can actually push out certain

404
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,810
certain binaries and have them run on a

405
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:56,620
device so a lot of similarities with

406
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:59,020
SilverHawk but it gave us a an initial

407
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,810
Andhra rap thread to pull on and and and

408
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,600
from this we're able to identify a

409
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,969
number of anti rat samples being used by

410
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,280
this actor so not only had they created

411
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,500
their own custom in-house tool but that

412
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,380
also started playing around with Andrew

413
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,720
a rat so if we jump back and do the same

414
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,680
sort of date analysis that we looked at

415
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,870
previously we can see that the Andrew

416
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,339
rat development took place in early 2016

417
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,770
and they are pretty heavy they're

418
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,610
creating a number of difference trojan

419
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,680
Ives applications before actually moving

420
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,790
to doing their own custom development

421
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,280
and what we think

422
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,990
has taken place here is that they got a

423
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,780
bit of mileage out of using an to rap

424
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,940
but this is a really well researched

425
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,650
tool so there's a lot of coverage from

426
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,960
antivirus vendors out there and it's

427
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,350
unlikely that it would stay undetected

428
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,030
for long on a compromised device so well

429
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,820
that it's likely they got value out of

430
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,890
it it's probably one of the reasons that

431
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,820
push them to actually creating their own

432
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:03,160
tool which is SilverHawk as Christine

433
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,080
mentioned like there was no use of 0

434
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,910
days so you might be wondering how these

435
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,960
guys were actually able to compromise

436
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,550
target target devices of interest and

437
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,160
this is kind of a technique that we see

438
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,930
from a lot of other actors that are

439
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,079
towards the lower end of sophistication

440
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,640
we see a lot of watering hole sites and

441
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,470
a lot of social engineering taking place

442
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,300
and that was the case with this

443
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,300
particular group so they're a liar a lot

444
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,150
on convincing people of interest to

445
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,160
visit one of their many watering hole

446
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,680
sites in this case we can see one for

447
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,719
the chat secure light application it's

448
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,780
got some convincing legitimate material

449
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,150
but then it's also got some stuff that

450
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,949
isn't quite legit which is here's a good

451
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,920
example which is how to actually go

452
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,650
about installing the chat secure app and

453
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,089
you know you should probably probably

454
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,410
not fall for what they're saying when

455
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,620
they say enabled device administrator

456
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,990
access because it's going to give this

457
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,770
this app obviously pretty much pretty

458
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:05,349
comprehensive control over your device

459
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,270
and as we started looking at all these

460
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,169
different watering holes that this group

461
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,639
had spun up we noticed that like there's

462
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,160
definitely some poor operational

463
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,690
security mistakes on their part so a lot

464
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,520
of open directories which allowed us to

465
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,860
see what they are they were hosting on

466
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,569
the infrastructure here we could see a

467
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:26,139
lot of the silverhawk samples that were

468
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:28,000
compiled in packaged in mid 2017 along

469
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,130
with some desktop binaries and this

470
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,530
provided the initial connection to a lot

471
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,750
of their desktop tooling as well and

472
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,580
then looking at other watering hole

473
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,710
sites that they had we can see here

474
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,750
pretty much all the Android rats ampuls

475
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,320
and they're the last modified time

476
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,700
stamps lineup with our analysis on from

477
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,870
a few slides back where we saw them

478
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,580
really ramping up and

479
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,580
an activity in early 2016

480
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:58,270
not only were they doing some some

481
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,919
mobile malware they were also creating

482
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,139
phishing sites like Kristen mentioned

483
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,429
that they've gotten a lot of mileage in

484
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,630
the past out of compromising

485
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,460
administrator accounts for certain

486
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,480
groups and kind of leveraging that

487
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,650
access to target a wider audience so we

488
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,029
can kind of see that down here on the

489
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,110
bottom left where they've successfully

490
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:21,460
compromised the admin account for the

491
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,129
Facebook group Syrian National

492
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,220
Democratic Alliance and then posted

493
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,520
malicious binaries that hosted on

494
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,080
mediafire so they're kind of a kind of

495
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,260
branching out and making sure that if

496
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,908
they can't actually compromise you via

497
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,440
by an Android surveillance we're told

498
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:41,500
they'll actually try and fish up

499
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,610
financials as well yeah and so we don't

500
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,350
have too much time for the stock to get

501
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,729
into the desktop component but it was

502
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,350
there in conjunction and the way that it

503
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,210
primarily spread was through trojan dyes

504
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,428
Word documents and the titles of these

505
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,169
documents seemed to be

506
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,070
attention-grabbing trying to entice what

507
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:57,460
appeared to be I guess primarily

508
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,520
military focused or journalists focused

509
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,330
targets you know exchange of prisoners

510
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,870
information about a mortar bombardment

511
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,830
or a leak steel system and then some of

512
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,270
the tools that they were using on the

513
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,629
desktop side if you're familiar with

514
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,610
them include NJ rat h1 plus a custom

515
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,450
dotnet downloader and dart comment I

516
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,740
mean on top of that some of their

517
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,690
desktop malware you second-stage scripts

518
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,990
and those were available on publicly

519
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,880
accessible sites like paceman and so in

520
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,020
terms of tying it all together and the

521
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,370
information that we've kind of briefly

522
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,049
shown you guys today and what we've been

523
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,668
looking at for a while and how we were

524
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:32,080
able to attribute it to the Syrian

525
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,260
electronic army it was through a lot of

526
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,389
things so debugging symbols from logging

527
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,039
statements and Android samples there was

528
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,140
Auto metadata in word files along with

529
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,960
open directories that OPSEC and then

530
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,460
some interesting c2 domains

531
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,470
regarding the c2 domains one that really

532
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,130
stood out at first was Bashar al-assad

533
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,799
one SCA dot know IP dot me so we think

534
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,559
SCA Syrian electronic army but then

535
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,960
regarding PDB file paths so PDB file

536
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,649
paths we got to them they contain

537
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,620
debugging information which can get

538
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,690
of a lot of insight into the developer

539
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,459
environment and so a lot of unique names

540
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,820
and handles that we saw were a loss

541
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,770
hacker the pro abu allah who mo asked

542
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,110
atop them are some other ones but two

543
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,960
ones of interest here a lush and the pro

544
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,429
so a lo shocker is a previously stated

545
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,230
member of the Syrian electronic army

546
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,570
that was called out by the European

547
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,910
cyber army who is very anti Assad anti

548
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,679
Syrian electronic army and he was also

549
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,450
previously referenced a few years ago in

550
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,730
a citizen lab report because he was

551
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,740
found also through traces through PDB

552
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,420
files to be Trojan izing desktop

553
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,870
versions of siphon which is an anti

554
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,310
surveillance software and so not was

555
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,620
also specifically targeting Syrian

556
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:46,280
dissidents but then another key member

557
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,679
here is the pro and the pro a.k.a meddle

558
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,629
Agha he's currently on the FBI cybers

559
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,150
most-wanted list as a known member of

560
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,770
the Syrian electronic army charged for a

561
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,900
lot of different things he was first

562
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,670
charged in 2016 but he was recently

563
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,530
indicted a few months ago in May 2000 a

564
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,170
teen still whereabouts unknown

565
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,550
but one of the charges that was kind of

566
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,710
probably one of the best-known Syrian

567
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,200
electronic army hacks was for engaging

568
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,610
in a hoax regarding a terrorist attack

569
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,590
where they hacked The Associated Press's

570
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,969
Twitter account said there were two

571
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,949
explosions in the White House and Barack

572
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,420
Obama was injured and that wasn't

573
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,360
physical terrorism but had a lot of

574
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,580
monetary effects where the Dow Jones

575
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,010
dropped 145 points in two minutes and

576
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,929
S&P index dropped for three minutes and

577
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,710
that wiped out almost 137 billion

578
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:32,420
dollars of value in it and then other

579
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,280
personas that we've got through metadata

580
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,170
and logging statements on the top from

581
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,810
like the desktop component meadow coder

582
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,100
the pro radix Kitab some unique

583
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,620
interesting usernames here

584
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,540
radix we've seen also not only on

585
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,330
desktop but in a lot of the mobile

586
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,129
source code as well so he's listed in

587
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,070
almost every sample of SilverHawk as

588
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,900
kind of involved in its development yeah

589
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,230
so with the personas we can see that you

590
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,910
know some of these hacker handles and

591
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,070
individuals have known connections

592
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,960
already to the ACA and others are you

593
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,790
know newcomers to the scene that appear

594
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,830
not only in in the desktop side of

595
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,360
things but also on the Android in the

596
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,580
Android piece as well as on watering

597
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,320
holes so at the top allows hacker and

598
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,659
the pro they already had that connection

599
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,730
and then these guys down the body

600
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,530
for the most part of spread between all

601
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,180
the different tooling that it's being

602
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,520
used by this group and then there are a

603
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:27,020
few others that you know we're

604
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,820
continuing to dig into basically so we

605
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,350
haven't been the only people are the

606
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,450
only researchers that have been looking

607
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,000
at this tool both on the Android and

608
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,470
desktop side so if you're interested in

609
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,040
this I strongly recommend checking out

610
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,690
360 threaten their threat intelligence

611
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,639
right up they've got some pretty good

612
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,280
stuff there as well as Kaspersky Labs

613
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:51,890
fire iff and citizen lab have looked at

614
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,389
either this tooling or the ACA so just

615
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,060
quickly some of the key takeaways from

616
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:59,300
this talk you know we've seen that the

617
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,070
SE a while they've been knowing to

618
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,240
conduct you know lower sophistication

619
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,429
and tax in the past that have

620
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,860
predominantly just been fishing we've

621
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,830
seen that they've expanded that out to

622
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,689
not only include custom desktop tools as

623
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,939
well as commodity desktop tools but also

624
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,030
the same sort of thing on the mobile

625
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,070
side of things so they're continuing to

626
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:22,460
use multi-platform tools as well as

627
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,290
create their own stuff and as we just

628
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
saw there are a number of new personas

629
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:29,810
now connected to to this group and at a

630
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,310
higher level it just really shows that

631
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,690
there's a low barrier to entry when it

632
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,520
comes to creating offensive mobile

633
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,410
tooling we do see some people are

634
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,080
definitely using premium tools that cost

635
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,360
a lot more but on the flip side there

636
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,070
are a much greater number of actors

637
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,719
deploying low sophistication tools and

638
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,520
having a lot of success without having

639
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,530
to rely on investing and you know zero

640
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,760
days it's quite easy to just create a

641
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,180
lot of this stuff using publicly

642
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,090
available code yeah so if you'd like to

643
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,930
follow us on Twitter it's Twitter

644
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,909
terminal refer flossman

645
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,250
my name because I'm boring Christian

646
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,020
daughter so and we're almost out of time

647
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,050
but we'll be up here or we could quickly

648
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,050
answer questions if anyone is interested

649
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,050
so

650
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:45,209
[Applause]

651
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:47,430
questions so okay I will just repeat the

652
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:52,260
question from beginning for everyone so

653
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:54,300
you said this unlockable tool they had

654
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,280
on their website for nine hundred ninety

655
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,350
nine dollars it had the difficulty of a

656
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,660
level zero correct me and I was

657
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,730
wondering how about the Trojan you just

658
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,790
showed this is someone somehow

659
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,130
obfuscated if this run time pact or was

660
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,460
it just like plain Android rat and row

661
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,890
rat to look at as in how did we get the

662
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,470
code or how difficult was it to get the

663
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:19,950
code quite straightforward so there are

664
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,950
a number of tools that that you could

665
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,120
use to get this information quite easily

666
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,510
some of them the free others aren't so

667
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,399
Jeb would be like a paid version that's

668
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,410
really good Android's reverse

669
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,180
engineering tool but there are a number

670
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,530
of other like freely accessible tools

671
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,470
it's like apktool or you could just

672
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:44,180
unzip it and look at the smiley as well

673
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:48,120

675
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,159
this tool infecting IOT devices um we

676
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,649
just got the timeline but we can answer

677
