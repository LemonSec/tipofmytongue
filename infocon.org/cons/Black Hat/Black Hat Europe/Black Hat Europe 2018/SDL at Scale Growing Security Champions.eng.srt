1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940
hi good morning everybody I am RINO

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,650
Boyle although lots of different things

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,139
out there like to take a different name

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,049
on a different spin on my last name so

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,609
that's not a mistake but I get things in

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,539
the mail I got things in e mail I get

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,070
website so all whose inevitable I think

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,090
that I encounter application security

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,429
some day with this name but but so a

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,340
little about me I've been in in this

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,890
field for almost 20 years initially I

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,110
was a pen tester working at Fidelity

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,329
Investments where we started up an

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,950
internal pen testing team totally

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,809
focused on application security and also

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,629
being part of an internal team meant

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,550
that we focused on not just finding

18
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,960
issues in our pen tests but also working

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,140
closely with the development teams to

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,360
make sure that they fix stuff then from

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,199
there I moved on to the research team at

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,820
Varick code where initially I was doing

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,250
sort of product focused research but

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,290
then over time transitioned into my

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,350
current role where I oversee our own

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,450
internal product security so again it's

27
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,070
not just about finding security issues

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,909
but working with all of our development

29
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,100
teams to fix those issues and this

30
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,750
picture is one time I was walking down

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,149
the street and a bird just landed on me

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,799
which I thought was pretty awesome so

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,750
that's why that's my picture but so what

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,079
we're here to talk about today is how to

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,509
build a security champions program this

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,490
is something that that we laid the

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,640
groundwork for at Varick code going back

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,500
about five years and have built it up

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,930
over time and learned a lot of lessons

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,759
from that experience and the the reason

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,119
we were looking into a security

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,310
champions program was that we had the

43
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,909
same problem that I think a lot of folks

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,920
do which is challenges with scaling our

45
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,149
product security function against a

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
development world that was changing so

47
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,878
our developing organization was growing

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,890
and they're switching to new

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,790
methodologies that meant they were

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,760
shipping things faster

51
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,640
they were releasing more frequently and

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,230
that meant security needed to find a way

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,809
to keep pace with that going back to to

54
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,840
2015 the appdev priority survey from

55
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,549
information week said that 69% of

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,030
organizations were using some sort of

57
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:36,459
agile methodology 13% were planning to

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,950
within 12 to 24 months

59
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,439
so overall that was the direction things

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,540
are moving faster and if security can't

61
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,340
find ways to scale and to keep up with

62
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,870
all of the development that's happening

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,170
and all the product that's getting

64
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,480
released security can fall behind on

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,179
those product lines and then there's the

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,010
exposure of shipping vulnerabilities

67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,549
more frequently just like your shipping

68
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:05,230
functionality more frequently so one so

69
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:07,510
in in addition to to all of the other

70
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,970
tools and and processes that we've

71
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,418
implemented to try to go after that

72
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,639
problem at very code one of the critical

73
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,310
pieces has been building this

74
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:21,729
partnership between product security and

75
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,760
the development organization in the form

76
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:26,470
of a security champions guild and that

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,470
relationship has been a win-win

78
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,000
relationship for both sides where we get

79
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,299
the scaling we need and they get some

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,579
tangible benefits as well and so today

81
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:40,419
I'm going to talk about what what we've

82
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:42,250
built some lessons is some things that

83
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:45,040
we did right the first time and some

84
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,909
things that I wish I had had someone to

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,798
tell me to do it this way at the time so

86
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,870
I asked you to hear a bit about what

87
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,540
we've done and how I've someone

88
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,549
generalized this and try to interpret it

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,409
to how you could apply it to your

90
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,479
organization and to the culture at your

91
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,650
organization because I think this is one

92
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,340
of those things that really does take

93
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,139
that customization to succeed and then

94
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,709
as a result you'll be able to build a

95
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:13,989
similar program and reap these rewards

96
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,849
of shipping secure software more

97
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:20,739
frequently not just shipping more

98
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:23,529
frequently so what is a security

99
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:25,270
champion there's a lot of definitions

100
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,400
out there and I think some of the most

101
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,799
frequent ones you'll see

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,979
go part of the way of what I view a

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,500
security champion as so my definition is

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,840
a product team member responsible for

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,040
ensuring security is incorporated into

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,330
the team's products and processes so

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,090
that's that's pretty general and a lot

108
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,070
of the definitions you'll see will say

109
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,039
that it that the focus is about

110
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,409
interfacing with security teams and I

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,570
think that's part of it but I think that

112
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,930
doesn't go far enough I think that

113
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,389
actual taking some amount of ownership

114
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,090
and some responsibility is also an

115
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,810
achievable part of the security champion

116
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,820
role if nothing else the way I sort of

117
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,800
summarized this is that you want the

118
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,930
security champion or security champions

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,090
to be the security conscience of the

120
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,490
team so that's that's the the

121
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,049
fundamental thing is for someone just to

122
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,229
be a part of that team that that's going

123
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,150
to make sure security comes up to be

124
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,430
that little voice in the back of the

125
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:31,929
team's collective head saying oh what

126
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:35,830
about security we attempt to have at

127
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,979
least two on every product team so that

128
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,750
we have some natural redundancy built in

129
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,729
things do vary from time to time but

130
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,530
generally the range is around one to

131
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:48,639
three with two being the the ideal and

132
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,549
we bring them through sort of a phased

133
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,560
process where initially it is kind of

134
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,139
just about being an interface to the

135
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,580
security team but as time goes on and as

136
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,490
they have more training and more

137
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,479
exposure they can take on some more

138
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,380
responsibilities the role is also

139
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,380
intended to fit in completely with

140
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:15,280
existing development driven processes we

141
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,110
don't ask for the security champions to

142
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,270
come in and dictate a bunch of

143
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,130
development processes that security

144
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,900
chooses we want them to still work

145
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,370
within whatever process they're working

146
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,159
in so if they're on a team is doing

147
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,479
agile great we're gonna try to find a

148
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,919
way to make this work with that if

149
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,950
they're from a team that's not doing

150
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,070
agile that's doing waterfall or you know

151
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,530
scrum fall or Kanban or something else

152
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,690
out there

153
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,049
we're gonna have them find a way to

154
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:45,090
adapt it to what their team is doing and

155
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,730
advocate for security in the process

156
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,109
that they are using

157
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,470
another important point is that it's not

158
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,390
a replacement for security whether that

159
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,120
be product security or any other type of

160
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,200
security group that's working with them

161
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,220
they're just intended to be sort of a

162
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,719
first level support within the team so

163
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,790
that the team can accomplish some things

164
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,100
without having to rely on those

165
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,780
centralized groups that are probably

166
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,430
overwhelmed with the number of teams

167
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:17,640
working on stuff and they're also not

168
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,340
just an individual security champion but

169
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,039
part of the guild meaning that there's a

170
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,619
support in place for them to work

171
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,460
together and share common problems and

172
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,790
share common solutions as well as

173
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,659
working with the security team so to get

174
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:39,150
things started with a program like this

175
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,610
there's a couple things that some things

176
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,650
that we did to seed the program

177
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,560
initially some of it we were doing not

178
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,060
so much with the with the intention of

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,000
starting a security champions program so

180
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,220
it was just our culture but when we

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,590
decided we were going to try this we set

182
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,410
out to identify some specific groups

183
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,489
that we knew would need to buy-in for

184
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,740
this type of program to be successful

185
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,290
and that there were certain things that

186
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,050
each of these groups would have to

187
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:11,070
commit to to make sure this was going to

188
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,870
work so the first group was security

189
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,150
that was pretty easy buy-in because it

190
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,940
was our idea if you're doing something

191
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,429
like this again hopefully you're seeing

192
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,890
the value and you'll be bought in but

193
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,330
that's not enough to just want to do

194
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,080
this you've also got to make the

195
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,090
commitment to to possibly make some

196
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,280
changes to the way you run some aspects

197
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,409
of your security program and then the

198
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,709
two that we in particular highlighted

199
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,140
were integration and fast implementation

200
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,780
so when I say integration I mean that as

201
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,170
a security team you're gonna have to

202
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,610
adopt the processes and the tools that

203
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,520
the development organization is using

204
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,180
and that they've chosen and you're also

205
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,970
gonna have to chain

206
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,890
when they change this was something that

207
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,140
we've dealt with even even on our scale

208
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,410
where the development team may decide

209
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,199
that they're gonna change from to start

210
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,089
using scrum and then a year later decide

211
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,730
scrums to heavyweight so they're gonna

212
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,040
change their process to scrum ban and

213
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,890
whatever changes they're deciding to

214
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,740
make because of how it benefits them in

215
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,390
running their process we have to find a

216
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,920
way to adapt so we have to define things

217
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,899
that are flexible enough to work with

218
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,589
whatever process or whatever tools

219
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,500
they're going to be using and then

220
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:33,300
hand-in-hand with that is is moving fast

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:36,270
so speed is important that's the focus

222
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,430
of development today is on shipping

223
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,980
things more frequently which doesn't

224
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,349
meet the old the old security model of

225
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,810
annual reviews of stuff or annual pen

226
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,690
tests so that means you've got to find

227
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,550
ways to move faster which means

228
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,100
incorporating into those processes

229
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,329
they're using but I think it it also

230
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,339
means sometimes that's you as the

231
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,010
security person getting out of the way

232
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,440
as much as possible this doesn't mean

233
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,360
you know calling it quits and saying art

234
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,089
Security's not a part of this anymore it

235
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,450
just means finding the places that are

236
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,520
most valuable for you to be directly in

237
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,000
line and possibly blocking the process

238
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,120
versus places where you can find tooling

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,130
or standards that the teams with the

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,970
help of their security champion can rely

241
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,550
on and and do it themselves so maybe you

242
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,050
don't need to be involved early in the

243
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,140
development process because the security

244
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,709
champion will be and you're still the

245
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:41,400
the check towards the end of the process

246
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:44,520
then from development the the two things

247
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,300
we ask there are one excepting security

248
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,370
as part of the process so with this with

249
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,449
this sort of trade-off of security

250
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,640
trying to get out of the way and help

251
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,250
them move faster that doesn't mean that

252
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,860
security can be forgotten it doesn't

253
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,959
mean that development can say oh yeah

254
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,640
well we'll totally do this and then not

255
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,709
do it they have to take some ownership

256
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,689
of security the same way that

257
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,330
as things have changed over time they

258
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,880
have they take control over they take

259
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,830
ownership over the the functionality of

260
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,180
their software and the performance of

261
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,000
their software and all these other

262
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,279
things that we can call quality security

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
needs to be part of that too and they

264
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,310
have to commit to adhering to that and

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,500
then holding themselves to the same

266
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,640
standard that you would if you were

267
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:36,060
involved in every part of this so again

268
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,760
just because security is creating this

269
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,250
new program and giving them some more

270
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,540
independence doesn't mean the standards

271
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,399
change if you have development

272
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,649
guidelines if you have corporate

273
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,089
policies all of that still applies and

274
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,600
the teams will still be held to that

275
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,040
you're just giving them a little more

276
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,980
flexibility in terms of how they achieve

277
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,980
that and possibly when you evaluate that

278
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,140
and then the third group is is

279
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,570
management of different types so this

280
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,120
could be people managers or this could

281
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,060
be project managers it depends on what

282
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,120
your organization looks like but the two

283
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:16,199
commitments here are the people and the

284
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,320
goals so if you're going to ask some

285
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,270
folks in your organization to be

286
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,029
security champions they're gonna have to

287
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,480
have a commitment to do the things that

288
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,189
that involves which again we're trying

289
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,080
to find a way to do this within all of

290
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,709
developments existing processes so we're

291
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,890
not making a big ask for you know weeks

292
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:40,020
and weeks of extra work or something but

293
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,630
we do need to make sure that that

294
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,339
there's a commitment that they're going

295
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,939
to be able to spend the time that they

296
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,320
need to actually come up to speed on

297
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,770
security so that they can perform this

298
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:57,329
role adequately and then second for the

299
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:01,260
goals if the if the goals aren't treated

300
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,920
the same as other goals would be things

301
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,010
will flounder

302
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,110
so how your organization sets goals will

303
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,550
be a big factor here whether it's on the

304
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,160
individual level for the security

305
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:14,849
champions or if we're talking about the

306
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,610
goals for a for a product so I got very

307
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,340
good we're now using a process called

308
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,160
safe

309
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,680
where every team has certain goals on a

310
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,449
regular cadence and we make sure that

311
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,029
security champion and product security

312
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,760
goals are part of that process just like

313
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:33,939
every other feature commit or anything

314
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:38,230
else we're looking at so then those same

315
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:41,140
goals also are going to be shared goals

316
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,820
at that point between security who's

317
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,250
probably setting some of the direction

318
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,589
for what the security champions will

319
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,240
work on and development with their

320
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,250
commitment to support that and

321
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,460
prioritize that and make sure that this

322
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:58,450
is happening the next set of things

323
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,770
these are things that we were doing

324
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,600
largely a very code not specifically -

325
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,430
to start off a security champions

326
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,670
program but just because of sort of the

327
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,430
culture that we had and our roots but if

328
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,589
you don't already have a strong sort of

329
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,689
culture of advocating for security and

330
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,420
making it something that is accessible

331
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,640
and maybe fun for development I would

332
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,050
encourage you to do that before you try

333
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,990
to actually kick off a security

334
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:30,370
champions program so at very code we had

335
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,320
a lot of Lunch and Learn sessions so we

336
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,060
had a recurring thing where it would be

337
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,790
monthly or twice a month and we'd have

338
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,560
some sort of Lunch and Learn where we

339
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,439
did get like pizza ordered or something

340
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,209
and have someone come present about some

341
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,700
topic that they were familiar with so we

342
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,410
had people talk about typography and we

343
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,240
had people talk about Burning Man we had

344
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,270
people talk about technical talks as

345
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,430
topics as well and security would

346
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,449
sometimes be a part of that but as we as

347
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,239
we knew we were gonna launch this

348
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:01,230
program we made it a point to get folks

349
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,140
from like our security research team to

350
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:07,480
present and just share some of what was

351
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,689
going on in the security world with a

352
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,940
larger group within our organization to

353
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,060
help drum up some interest in security

354
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,670
as a topic second post conference

355
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,380
summaries so different people throughout

356
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,319
the organization would be going to

357
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,370
security conferences throughout the year

358
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
folks from our research team would be

359
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,510
going out to like blackhat Def Con and

360
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,489
shmoocon and lots of different

361
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,020
conferences developers would go

362
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,460
sometimes on there

363
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,699
or sometimes that's part of their

364
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,530
training just because of what we do and

365
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,840
we would organize a session after those

366
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,810
for people to come back and just share a

367
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,420
little bit about what they had seen at

368
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,170
the conference so like in in the summer

369
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,880
after after the big Vegas conferences we

370
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,219
would reserve a room for like an hour

371
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,600
and we would have people sign up and we

372
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,670
take a look at how many people we had

373
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,890
and we we'd allocate you know around 2

374
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,699
minutes per person to just give a real

375
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,100
quick headline version of what the talk

376
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,890
was and provide some information to go

377
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,910
further and this was open to all of the

378
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,920
development just like the lunch and

379
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,719
learns use open to everyone so they can

380
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,420
come in and hear about what was

381
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,120
happening in security and and take and

382
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,729
learn about where to go to see some more

383
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,350
depth about it and then third and then

384
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,870
the one that's that's probably still our

385
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:29,200
most successful is having regular

386
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:32,320
captured the flag or CTF sessions this

387
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,410
started off because a group of a group

388
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,180
of folks were got hooked on there was a

389
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,719
challenge released online called the

390
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,660
hacking Easter puzzle sort of CTF

391
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,660
challenge a few years back and we had a

392
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,339
whole group try it out a lot of folks

393
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,990
who hadn't done any sort of like CTF

394
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,810
stuff before so this was a good one

395
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,730
because it was technical but not

396
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,619
exploitation for everything there was a

397
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,420
lot of sort of puzzle just sort of

398
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,030
technological puzzles types of

399
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,430
challenges and we had a lot of folks

400
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:08,109
from development get hooked on it and so

401
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,310
we set a weekly meeting sort of towards

402
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,699
the end of the day so we did it from

403
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:16,510
like 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock on Tuesdays

404
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,370
and so I meant if people couldn't come

405
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,349
right at 5:00 you know if it was they

406
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,909
they had to kind of do this after hours

407
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,980
in some sense for their team they could

408
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,440
come from 5 to 6 but everyone would get

409
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,410
together in the cafeteria and work on

410
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,510
these puzzles together and it became

411
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,820
such a successful thing that we kept it

412
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,100
going even after that challenge was over

413
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,100
we had something like at least 10 I

414
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,320
think developers finish the entire

415
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,050
puzzle set during the time it was open

416
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,439
and then from there we made it a

417
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,740
recurring thing wherever

418
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,450
every week now we do it around lunchtime

419
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,640
we'd still do like a two-hour slot right

420
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,820
around lunchtime once a week so that

421
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,500
people have some flexibility but they

422
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,240
come in and they work on whatever they

423
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,620
want we do we have sort of a loose

424
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,170
curriculum for people that are totally

425
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,820
new to it where we use like over the

426
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:09,530
wire has some just open CTF challenges

427
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:14,800
they're focused on particular topics

428
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,800
like web security or Linux security or

429
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:22,070
crypto and that's something that we keep

430
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,379
going and new people come in as other

431
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,189
people sort of tap out for a while and

432
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,070
it's been a really successful way of

433
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,540
getting new developers who might have a

434
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,669
little bit of an interest in security or

435
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,810
didn't even know they would they come in

436
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,540
and they start to learn a little bit

437
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,100
about oh so this is so I keep hearing

438
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,480
about how I'm supposed to protect

439
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,590
against like cross-site scripting and

440
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,420
sequel injection and all these other

441
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,840
things this gives them a chance to

442
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,240
actually go through that and go through

443
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,520
that at their own pace and and see the

444
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,830
progress they're making and understand

445
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,370
the defense better because now they

446
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,590
understand what the attack actually is

447
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,260
so as a result of going through all of

448
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,480
these hopefully you'll get some ideas or

449
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,280
some of these or other ideas that you

450
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,010
may have something you can incorporate

451
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,879
security application into your current

452
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:18,680
organization that'll help you find some

453
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,570
candidates so before starting off the

454
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,850
program you're gonna have to have some

455
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,879
folks volunteering to be security

456
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,439
champions so that means you've got to

457
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,010
find the right people in the

458
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,290
organization hopefully through doing

459
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,350
stuff like a CTF session or these lunch

460
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,750
and learns you'll have some ideas of

461
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,370
folks that have come to those and have

462
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,130
started to express an interest and those

463
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:46,159
will be really good candidates like I

464
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,880
said the CTF sessions have for me been

465
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,680
the number one sort of recruitment

466
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,510
method they're people come in they start

467
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,970
doing that and then as they get more

468
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,590
involved they've become a natural fit

469
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,410
for being the security champion on their

470
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,899
team if there's

471
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:04,200
an opening there which will also find

472
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,690
from from talking to those different

473
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,860
groups that we need buy-in from you'll

474
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,110
also find that they probably have some

475
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,020
ideas there may be someone on a team

476
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,149
who's already doing a lot of this stuff

477
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,770
and advocating for security but maybe

478
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,660
they're just sort of doing it a little

479
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,790
bit more in a vacuum and and not as

480
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,990
connected in or maybe you know them

481
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,129
already in there they're doing some of

482
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,910
this stuff and working with you closely

483
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:29,370
so again they'll just be a natural fit

484
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,540
but from all of these from all these

485
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,510
possible sources

486
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,610
I think volunteers are best we've had

487
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,670
volunteers and we've had what we suffer

488
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:44,010
I'd call voluntold which is the manager

489
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:46,110
has has sort of nominated them and we've

490
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,879
definitely seen the most engagement from

491
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,379
people that are doing this because they

492
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,240
genuinely find it interesting and

493
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,890
because they want to be a part of

494
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,980
security so I definitely recommend

495
00:20:52,890 --> 00:21:01,260
volunteers whenever possible some of the

496
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,550
qualities around what makes a good

497
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,340
security champion

498
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:09,899
so we specifically look for people that

499
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:13,020
have some sort of influential role on

500
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,940
the team so that can be something like

501
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,350
that they're Trailblazer on the team

502
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,510
they're one of the team members who

503
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,919
really sort of pushes the boundaries in

504
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,250
terms of whether that's in terms of the

505
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,420
technology that the team is using or the

506
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,550
processes if someone who's pushing to

507
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,940
say oh this you know the scrum process

508
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,830
is is even too heavyweight can we do

509
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,600
something a little bit different how can

510
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:38,100
we how can we restructure things to work

511
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,629
better folks that I used to say that

512
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,270
like you know the people who were

513
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,700
talking about docker back before anybody

514
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,290
else knew who what that was and thought

515
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:51,390
doctors were it was just like a pair of

516
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:53,190
pants or something but the the people

517
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,720
who are looking for what's next and

518
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,640
looking for how to change things and

519
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,530
prove the way the team works are gonna

520
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,450
be influential in some way that can be

521
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,110
advantageous if you're asking them to

522
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,760
advocate for security other other ways

523
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,469
that someone might be influential again

524
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,810
it's really going to depend on your

525
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,030
culture and on the team but it could be

526
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,510
that that there

527
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,649
that they're really just they have some

528
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,960
seniority like there's someone who's

529
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,420
been working on this product forever and

530
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,550
they sort of set the standards for how

531
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,650
things go with it and that would be a

532
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,560
great person to have involved it could

533
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:32,250
be skill based in that there may be

534
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,260
someone who's who has a background that

535
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,670
really closely aligns like maybe maybe

536
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,890
they were security person but they've

537
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,250
moved into development it could be any

538
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,380
sort of set of skills there and related

539
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,890
to skills we also don't limit this to

540
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,230
any particular role so for us security

541
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,320
champions can be a developer they can be

542
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,610
someone who's primarily a tester they

543
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,040
can be someone who's focused on like

544
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:59,340
build and release engineering which

545
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,170
really serves us well when we have

546
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,550
different tasks across all of the

547
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,130
security champions going after different

548
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,620
problems if it's primarily a development

549
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,270
issue well then we have all of our

550
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,909
development experts weigh in and share

551
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,440
how they come up with a solution if it's

552
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,300
something more related to how do we

553
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,580
integrate this security tool into our

554
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,110
pipeline then it's great to have someone

555
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,179
with release engineering skills and

556
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,820
familiarity with the tools we're using

557
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,220
to build our software so we don't limit

558
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,159
it based on role we encourage that

559
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,900
diversity actually so that different

560
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,170
problems have different groups of folks

561
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,150
that can help solve it a couple things

562
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:40,830
that we specifically try to avoid though

563
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:42,570
are we we set like a 90-day waiting

564
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,649
period from the time when someone joined

565
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,929
us the company or if someone has just

566
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,090
just switched to like a new team or a

567
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,560
new product that they're working on

568
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,860
because we don't want to overload

569
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,540
someone who's ramping up on their sort

570
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,070
of day-to-day so if someone's new to the

571
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,629
company that means they're learning the

572
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,290
culture they're learning whatever

573
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,330
product it is they're working on they're

574
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,980
focused on a lot of things and they're

575
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,050
probably also not going to be that

576
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,290
influential while they're getting going

577
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:14,909
so we may work with the team that we

578
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,639
know has this gap and we want to

579
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,140
introduce a security champion and we may

580
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,550
even sort of earmark someone that they

581
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,580
know is coming in to say oh they would

582
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,080
be a great security champion but we're

583
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,540
gonna let them get up to speed first

584
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,340
we're going

585
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,530
let them get to the point where they're

586
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,030
really performing on the team and then

587
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,730
we'll bring them into this and give them

588
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:36,100
some new stuff to ramp up on and and be

589
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,960
involved in the program and then

590
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,830
similarly again just trying to avoid

591
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,540
people being overloaded we avoid having

592
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,870
security champions that are filling

593
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:50,500
other roles on the team such as a scrum

594
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,060
master or a member of another guild like

595
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,710
we really only have one other guild

596
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,679
that's fully staffed which is our UX

597
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,440
guild but we try to avoid someone being

598
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,900
tapped for too many of those roles or if

599
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,150
they're working as a team lead which

600
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,850
sometimes those those may make them

601
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,500
influential but again we don't want to

602
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,709
overload them we don't want their

603
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,800
day-to-day responsibilities with this

604
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,350
other role to overwhelm the time and the

605
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,100
effort that they could be doing for

606
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:24,699
achieving our security goals

607
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:27,189
so once suppose you've got buy-in from

608
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,890
these different groups you've got a

609
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:34,030
group of like volunteers that are gonna

610
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,990
be your security champions but now

611
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,030
you're gonna have to start thinking

612
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,340
about what what are you actually going

613
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,590
to have them do so I'm willing to bet

614
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,110
that if you're if you're working in

615
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,480
security you probably have some ideas of

616
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:49,389
things that the development teams you

617
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,030
work with could improve in terms of the

618
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,710
their security processes maybe they

619
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:57,899
maybe they've got a bunch of security

620
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,900
debt that you know about and that really

621
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,110
never those goals are that you have in

622
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:15,250
mind for how you can improve the

623
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:17,590
security of your products try to try to

624
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:23,010
categorize them into two buckets the

625
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:26,320
first being things that are more about

626
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:29,260
having someone from the team work with

627
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,929
you to follow a process that you've

628
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,730
already set or to implement a tool that

629
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,110
you think would be helpful or maybe

630
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,570
they're already supposed to be doing but

631
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,748
hasn't been well adopted

632
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:43,149
but something that doesn't ask the

633
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:45,129
security champion to be a security

634
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:47,439
expert but something where they can just

635
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:50,049
partner with you to accomplish this and

636
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,429
then the second bucket are those things

637
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:56,229
where they might be a little bit more

638
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:59,080
self-sufficient so so the example that I

639
00:26:56,229 --> 00:27:02,559
use for our history at very code was

640
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,199
around code reviews so yes like we're a

641
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,220
security tool company but we also do

642
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,720
manual reviews of things too and we put

643
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,749
a lot of effort actually into defining a

644
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:19,330
process for doing security code review

645
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:20,639
as part of our agile process where a

646
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,989
[Music]

647
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,728
security review is part of the criteria

648
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:26,139
for closing a story out during the

649
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:29,559
sprint if it's been selected as a

650
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:31,590
security review and so it's important

651
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,999
for us and it's also extremely

652
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,949
overwhelming for a very small product

653
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:38,409
security team to try to keep pace with

654
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,409
that and to close those reviews out on a

655
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:45,639
week-by-week basis to keep pace with the

656
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:48,070
development teams so our our first sort

657
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:50,228
of bucket there of asking the security

658
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,239
champions to be involved in that without

659
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:55,869
needing to be experts was just about

660
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:58,840
them understanding when do they need to

661
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:00,668
ask for a security review and following

662
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,478
the process that we have for that and

663
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:07,509
then the secondary bucket is about them

664
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:12,249
taking a little bit more involvement in

665
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:14,529
those reviews and so I say to group them

666
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:18,190
into these two sorts of buckets because

667
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:20,440
I view security champions in their

668
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:24,549
development as kind of having two phases

669
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,899
and so the first phase is the one where

670
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:28,749
they they really are just that

671
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:30,428
conscience for the team and the focus is

672
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:33,879
just sort of on asking that question of

673
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:36,190
when do we need security so as long as

674
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,330
they're in their existing meetings with

675
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,090
the team and they're asking that

676
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,369
question oh I think have we thought

677
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,228
about is there are there security

678
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:46,480
implications for this story and

679
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:48,099
answering that question and if they

680
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,230
can't answer that question at least

681
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,830
raising it so that it can be escalated

682
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,480
and they can

683
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:57,399
to security so at this phase they're

684
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,309
still gonna need a lot of nurturing

685
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:03,189
there they're just dipping their toes

686
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,720
into security and we're not expecting

687
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,679
them to take a lot of ownership for

688
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,320
these things just to follow some process

689
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,140
so to use the code review example at

690
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,080
this point we'll be asking them to to

691
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,230
have some means of identify which

692
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,199
stories need a security code review for

693
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,610
us we did this by working with all the

694
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,649
security champions and that sort of

695
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,299
first batch that we brought in and we

696
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:31,178
asked them to take a look at past

697
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,519
security findings so stuff that the

698
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:36,429
security team had found in their product

699
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,769
in the past and find some of the

700
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,269
patterns there and write them up in

701
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:43,630
something that we called a grooming

702
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:45,130
guideline so this now meant that we gave

703
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,899
them some we give them a template to

704
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,850
sort of start from that just identified

705
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:53,199
certain things like if this story

706
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:56,049
involves any sort of crypto anything it

707
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,299
needs a security review but then we

708
00:29:56,049 --> 00:30:00,908
looked with them at their past findings

709
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:03,309
to say okay so this story it might not

710
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:05,169
have anything that's really as obvious

711
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,610
as like oh there's crypto code here it

712
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:09,840
might have just been like oh we added a

713
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:13,299
new API but maybe they forgot to put

714
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,799
proper access controls on that API so we

715
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:16,240
captured that as part of their grooming

716
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,519
guideline to say okay anytime we're

717
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,149
adding a new API it means there has to

718
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,399
be a security control around access

719
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:27,158
control and that means it's a candidate

720
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,370
for a security review and so this

721
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,470
document for each team became something

722
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,649
that anybody from the team could look at

723
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,779
and evaluate their story and determine

724
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:41,350
does this meet the criteria for getting

725
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:44,559
a security review so the security

726
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:49,000
champion again worked closely with us to

727
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,740
to define what this stuff was and didn't

728
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,240
need to be a security expert so this was

729
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,889
something that pretty much anybody from

730
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,559
the team who was interested would have

731
00:30:53,889 --> 00:31:02,260
been able to go through this process and

732
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,908
not participate from there we we moved

733
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,780
on from like just having those grooming

734
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:09,040
guidelines

735
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:11,320
to making things even more repeatable we

736
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,080
now have like a sort of online wizard

737
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,389
interface that teams can use to follow

738
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,000
our process for determining if something

739
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,130
needs a security code review and and now

740
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,360
even which level of security code review

741
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:27,850
and we found once we had this group

742
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,080
together that we would inevitably find

743
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:35,080
uses for this particular group of people

744
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,540
even beyond these sort of goals that we

745
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,250
were setting because we found that we

746
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,840
now had a group of folks that had

747
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,850
volunteered to participate in the

748
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,399
security of their product and knew their

749
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,199
product well so when we started to

750
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,840
implement a product security incident

751
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,850
response team to deal with high severity

752
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,580
disclosures or just high publicity

753
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:57,419
disclosures that we needed to be able to

754
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,889
react to and understand our exposure

755
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,970
this was in the days before things like

756
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:07,120
automated SCA but the the security

757
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,400
champions became a natural fit for okay

758
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,100
we have an urgent issue we need to know

759
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:15,280
which product lines are affected we

760
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,379
could very quickly send this request out

761
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,920
to them and have them report back in and

762
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,240
say oh yes you know preferably oh no

763
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,970
we're not using this product at all

764
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,250
we're ok or yes we are using this

765
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,510
product and then we could work with them

766
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,870
to figure out if there actually was some

767
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,129
exposure so there was a no shortage of

768
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,989
things we found to do with this group

769
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,970
once we had that that ball rolling

770
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,590
including all of these types of things

771
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,310
that didn't actually involve them to be

772
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:46,090
security experts but as we move on from

773
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:48,310
that phase and and this I think is where

774
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:51,370
the real payoff from a security

775
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,169
champions program can happen is or

776
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,229
whether they start to bear fruit right

777
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:00,070
is is when you can get into like a phase

778
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:01,780
2 type of goal with them so for us to

779
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:06,310
use the security code review example

780
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:09,520
again this even with you know having

781
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,899
this process that helped so now we have

782
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,820
we had all of these security champions

783
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,920
helping their teams identify which

784
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,020
stories needed a security review if

785
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,279
anything that increased the volume of

786
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,830
security reviews our

787
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,909
our very small product security team had

788
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,769
to deal with which could be very

789
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:29,320
problematic because we were definitely a

790
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:31,929
bottleneck we were an externality to the

791
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,668
team but we were part of their

792
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:36,039
requirements to actually say their

793
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:40,960
story's done so this is this was always

794
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,580
a very sort of tense topic things would

795
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,049
go well for a while and then inevitably

796
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,059
one team would have a huge spike in

797
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:48,519
their output and we would struggle to

798
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:52,059
keep up and we would become a blocker

799
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:54,669
and that would get escalated because it

800
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:56,830
would be a problem so we looked at that

801
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:59,799
as something that we really thought we

802
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:03,549
could find a way through the security

803
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:07,658
champions guild to ease some of the some

804
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:09,069
of the tension there and in a way that

805
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:12,970
let them take a little bit more

806
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:16,569
ownership around the process so what we

807
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:19,239
did was identify a two-tiered process

808
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,829
for security reviews where there's still

809
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:24,969
some reviews that have to go to product

810
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:26,470
security but before that they have to go

811
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,239
through a security champion review and

812
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:30,279
then there's some stories that just have

813
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,928
to have a security champion review and

814
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:33,489
we knew that if we were going to go

815
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,399
after this approach this meant

816
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,288
definitely transitioning from a security

817
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,399
champion who just knows how to interface

818
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:45,010
with a security team - one that actually

819
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:49,750
has learned enough about security and

820
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:52,000
specifically code review to do this our

821
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:55,059
first attempt at it I totally totally

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,160
failed we came up with an approach that

823
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,510
was sort of very mentor driven like what

824
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,259
we had done with the grooming guidelines

825
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,849
and started going down that process and

826
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,339
realized someone could go through this

827
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:08,559
whole whole process do everything we

828
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:11,078
asked of them and never find a security

829
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,609
bug which seems like a pretty bad way to

830
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,970
get someone ready to look at code and

831
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:18,180
find security bugs so again being very

832
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,709
in the spirit of trying to be agile we

833
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,440
failed as quick as possible on that when

834
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,119
we saw that wasn't going to happen and

835
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,069
tried to figure out okay how we iterated

836
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,290
and said how can we do this in a way

837
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:31,360
that's actually going to be successful

838
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,910
so it took a little bit more time from

839
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,130
the security team to build a program

840
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,730
that would make them successful in doing

841
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:43,150
this but we did so we we came up with a

842
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:45,160
three sort of three three activities

843
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,170
that we asked the security champions to

844
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,450
before they could take on these code

845
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,940
reviews and so we asked them to do like

846
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:55,060
some online e-learning about sort of

847
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,960
fundamentals of SAP sack and then second

848
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:01,450
we had them sit and participate in a two

849
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,790
day training course given by product

850
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,990
security where we talked again about

851
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,720
some sort of fundamental security

852
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:10,990
concepts like confidentiality integrity

853
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,779
availability and stuff that we take for

854
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:16,149
granted because we hear it all the time

855
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:19,690
but they maybe don't hear about it in

856
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:24,910
that context as well as some of just the

857
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:28,870
the the concepts of like you know trusts

858
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:31,029
trust zones trust boundaries and white

859
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:33,609
list versus black lists and positive

860
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,930
versus negative security models a lot of

861
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,180
those fundamental concepts that we

862
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,299
understand but that don't make it to the

863
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,960
developers we do half a morning focused

864
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,820
on that then we start moving into

865
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,360
specific controls like data validation

866
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:52,510
logging error handling encoding and

867
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,640
sequel parameterization and then we do

868
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,800
on the second day some threat modeling

869
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,220
exercises based on what they've gone

870
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,170
through already and those particular

871
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,540
controls that we talk about with them

872
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:09,160
are the same ones that we expect them to

873
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:11,230
look for in security reviews so again we

874
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,460
asked them to do this within the context

875
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,080
of what they're already doing because

876
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,750
teams are already doing peer code review

877
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,660
and then we chose some security topics

878
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,880
that we thought were realistic for this

879
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,319
group of folks to look for so there's

880
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,630
nothing too advanced here it's things

881
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,690
like are you logging stuff and are you

882
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,100
logging stuff that you shouldn't be and

883
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,780
it's it's not that complicated it's

884
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,270
stuff that they're already looking at or

885
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,730
just adding a few things for what they

886
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:40,390
should look at as well and then the

887
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:41,770
third part is again since our first take

888
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,150
on this didn't give them enough

889
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:46,960
opportunity to actually

890
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:49,329
bugs we put together some exercises

891
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,490
where they can actually find bugs so we

892
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:54,730
went through some old findings we had

893
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:57,129
and we sort of abstracted them and made

894
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:00,099
them a little bit less product specific

895
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,660
and we actually spin up once they've

896
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:04,390
gone through that training they can

897
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,848
schedule the time and I spin up an

898
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,769
environment for them that has all these

899
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,970
merge requests in the same tool that

900
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:11,919
they would normally be looking at

901
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,200
they're merge requests in and I asked

902
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,660
them to go in and do a peer review on it

903
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,788
including applying the security stuff

904
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,279
that they've done in the past couple

905
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:23,980
days and they go through and they look

906
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:26,109
for the bugs and they actually they know

907
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,599
there's bugs in there but they do a

908
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:29,890
really good job of finding them and then

909
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,420
we get together afterwards and have a

910
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,730
one-on-one conversation where they

911
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:37,119
explain what they went there what the

912
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:39,549
process was what they found and it's

913
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,759
been a much more successful way of

914
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:45,519
introducing them to that process and if

915
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:47,529
they complete all of these things and

916
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,049
based on the conversation if they feel

917
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:51,730
confident that they could do this and I

918
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:53,170
get a good strong sense or someone else

919
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,599
for product security gets a strong sense

920
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,460
that that they're ready that will

921
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,809
actually add them to the to the list of

922
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:03,819
certified code reviewers and now they're

923
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:06,460
they're very much in that sort of Phase

924
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:07,989
two of being a security champion where

925
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,619
they can actually take on a little bit

926
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:13,239
more responsibility and make product

927
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:20,440
security less of a bottleneck for their

928
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:24,339
team they're an important point there

929
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,289
though it is to have a lot of clarity

930
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:28,210
around the scope of something like that

931
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,489
because obviously this could be a recipe

932
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,109
for disaster right if we we just told

933
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:35,890
them okay you guys are good to do your

934
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:38,710
own cold code reviews go and we didn't

935
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,538
still have that some concrete ways for

936
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,390
them to know exactly which code reviews

937
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:45,730
they should be taking on themselves and

938
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,890
which ones they shouldn't then that

939
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,480
could be a real problem so that's why we

940
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,450
still ask them to follow the same

941
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,630
process that they were before so that we

942
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,620
still maintain visibility into the fact

943
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,570
that code reviews

944
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,730
are happening or not happening if

945
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:08,170
they're not and then we can detect that

946
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:12,760
and and deal with it so then for things

947
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:18,430
that that we do to sort of help sustain

948
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:20,830
the program our one reward the security

949
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,649
champions so so you're asking them to

950
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:26,500
take on some more responsibility you're

951
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,390
asking them to do even more in their

952
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,830
current role and and in the in

953
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,980
everything that their team is already

954
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:34,480
doing so there should be something in it

955
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,040
for them

956
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,700
besides just the fact that they might

957
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,650
want to so some things are just the

958
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,569
access they get to the security team or

959
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,130
the security teams can be really

960
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:49,450
interesting for them especially if they

961
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:50,740
are interested in this we find that we

962
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,710
have people come in who are really just

963
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:57,310
excited to be able to work with our team

964
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,510
and to learn more about this they're

965
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,490
also getting some really valuable

966
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,550
experience it's kind of a resume builder

967
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:05,350
to say not just I'm a developer but oh

968
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,540
I'm a developer who's also had some

969
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:11,549
specialization in security because it's

970
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:14,920
such an important topic we give them

971
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:17,500
access to extra training that they

972
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,570
wouldn't have just on their team so

973
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,030
every team has a certain allocation of

974
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,460
training budget but we have a dedicated

975
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,230
security champions training budget so

976
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,170
that means security champions just have

977
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,810
to get the approval from their team to

978
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,880
be unavailable for whatever duration it

979
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,259
is for the training they're going on but

980
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,820
the team doesn't have to make any

981
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,500
financial commitment so we've sent

982
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,270
people to you know big groups of

983
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,400
security champions to local conferences

984
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,830
near us we've sent folks out to bigger

985
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,400
conferences like black hat and DEF CON

986
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:52,720
and we could do that all without asking

987
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,520
the development teams to pay for it the

988
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,830
CTF sessions so that sort of like

989
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,810
learning to hack and being involved in

990
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,090
that way and seeing that other side of

991
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:03,340
it it can be really interesting and it

992
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,900
also can just be fun and and that's

993
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,859
something that they get value from and

994
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,029
then

995
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:13,670
stickers badges shirts whatever you know

996
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:15,140
whatever whatever really works in your

997
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,729
culture for some sort of like

998
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,069
recognition of this is someone who's

999
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:21,319
done something special or or fulfills a

1000
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:23,239
special role so like you know we we we

1001
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,670
have a lot of stickers around the office

1002
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:27,049
and we do different runs of these like

1003
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,969
zero one stickers and we have like a

1004
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:34,459
special one that only security champions

1005
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:37,910
get so and then second staying in touch

1006
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:41,269
so this really is about working with

1007
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:44,420
these team members as well as creating

1008
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:47,209
sort of a community across all of them

1009
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:50,569
so however however your development

1010
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:53,149
teams are are staying in touch like if

1011
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,609
they're using slack or HipChat or some

1012
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,630
other messaging service

1013
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,949
make sure there's like a channel or

1014
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,890
maybe IRC and make sure there's a

1015
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:03,079
channel for security champions we do

1016
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,368
this and we make sure all the security

1017
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:06,529
champions are in there as a means of

1018
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:08,479
communication and inevitably people also

1019
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:10,489
stumble upon it and want to pay

1020
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:14,029
attention and that also can be a

1021
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:16,249
recruitment technique eventually but

1022
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:18,140
it's a place for them to to share notes

1023
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,669
and to connect with each other in

1024
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:24,199
addition to connecting with the security

1025
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:26,420
team we also do guild meetings we used

1026
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:27,739
to do them monthly as the programs kind

1027
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,689
of matured we tend to do it more

1028
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:31,779
quarterly now to make sure that we

1029
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:34,399
really have enough stuff to talk about

1030
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:36,349
but we use those meetings to to get

1031
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,689
together and see how things are going

1032
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:41,479
with the different teams are there

1033
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:43,219
problems that they're encountering as we

1034
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:45,019
have like quarterly goals for the

1035
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:47,150
programs that becomes our venue for

1036
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:49,189
sharing notes about what the goal is and

1037
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,499
having someone who maybe has already

1038
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:53,449
made some progress on that goal share

1039
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:55,578
that with everybody else so that as they

1040
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:57,949
start to look at it they can have a bit

1041
00:43:55,579 --> 00:44:00,109
of a head start but all these things are

1042
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:02,660
just are just ways of keeping people

1043
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:04,819
connected both with the security teams

1044
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:08,178
as well as each other so that they're

1045
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:09,859
benefitting from the group an important

1046
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:12,640
thing too since this is is kind of a

1047
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:16,279
guild and a particular role we don't

1048
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,600
when someone changes teams we ask them

1049
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:20,550
to take the role with them

1050
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,660
so I know I said before like we don't

1051
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,040
want someone who's ramping up on

1052
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,720
something new but that's we don't want

1053
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,690
them ramping up on the security side of

1054
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,549
things and their product but if you're

1055
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,050
in this in the guild and you've been

1056
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,270
doing this on your product for a while

1057
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,820
and then you change teams and are just

1058
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,320
working on a new product even if it

1059
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,510
means maybe now we're gonna have like

1060
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,840
you know four on that product we know

1061
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:46,170
it's only temporary and having extra

1062
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,610
ones never hurts so we'll ask them to

1063
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,990
keep that role as they move around

1064
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,220
because they're still a part of the

1065
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:54,569
guild they're still a part of the

1066
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,089
program monitoring progress so this

1067
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,260
one's definitely important because

1068
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:01,410
especially if you're trying to

1069
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:04,110
transition some of the responsibility to

1070
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,940
the teams how can you and your security

1071
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,920
and your security role make sure that

1072
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,500
they are staying true to that commitment

1073
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,910
from before all of this that they're

1074
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,430
going to hold themselves to the same

1075
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,319
standard and how can you see that you're

1076
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,330
actually progressing and achieving the

1077
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,450
goals that you that you set for

1078
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:23,009
yourselves and for the program so all

1079
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,560
the metrics that you're probably using

1080
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,890
now about stuff like security findings

1081
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:31,470
and all the rest of it that all still

1082
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:34,230
applies but you can probably do some

1083
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:36,390
more stuff as well so either tracking

1084
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:39,870
that's related to a particular goal so

1085
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:42,210
we do this quarter by quarter like when

1086
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,430
we do a new security champion goal for

1087
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,260
everybody we set up whether it's a

1088
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:49,140
Kanban board or it's like a dashboard

1089
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,470
depending on on what the objective is so

1090
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,640
like we had a big push for like closing

1091
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,919
SCA vulnerabilities when we started

1092
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,600
using a new tool there and so we had a

1093
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,130
nice dashboards to check in for other

1094
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,480
things like if we're asking everyone to

1095
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,380
do some elearning we might just have a

1096
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,120
Kanban board but one thing that we

1097
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,970
introduced specifically alongside the

1098
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,359
security champions program was our

1099
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:15,180
product security maturity model so

1100
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,490
there's there's some sort of common ones

1101
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:20,069
out there like bisa more open Sam and

1102
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:22,229
they have their purpose but they didn't

1103
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,970
really map to what we were trying to do

1104
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:26,280
with the security champions program and

1105
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,680
how we wanted to measure the impact of

1106
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,360
the security champions on their teams

1107
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,899
and their products

1108
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,520
so we took this format that again

1109
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,460
learning from our counterparts and

1110
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,680
development we already had like a build

1111
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,480
a release engineering maturity model in

1112
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,120
this sort of format where it was just

1113
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,310
different levels of expertise and so

1114
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,130
different topics and we brainstormed

1115
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,930
what are some of the topics that we want

1116
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,930
to focus on over the next couple years

1117
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,600
and improve how our teams are doing so

1118
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:00,450
that's where we came up with this list

1119
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,000
and then we defined sort of beginner

1120
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,950
level as our base level as like they're

1121
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,690
not really doing anything and then we

1122
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,180
defined the expert level as what we

1123
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,160
thought like an ideal for us like a dev

1124
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,540
set off steam what would they be doing

1125
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:17,940
and then we tried to map out a

1126
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:22,710
progression from doing nothing to that

1127
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:24,990
expert level and we go through this on a

1128
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,460
regular basis and evaluate the teams on

1129
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,410
where they are on these different

1130
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,510
categories and while this isn't

1131
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,430
something we change a lot it can be

1132
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,690
changed if we as we're trying to get to

1133
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,580
a goal if we find like you know what

1134
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,170
this really wasn't realistic we do

1135
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,810
reserve the right to change it over time

1136
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,490
and we also know that this isn't

1137
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,560
exhaustive for everything that we ever

1138
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,970
want to do with our security program but

1139
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,390
these are the things we wanted to focus

1140
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:51,569
on in the short term and we can add more

1141
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:53,520
rows as we need to there's a lot to

1142
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,260
figure out in terms of how do you how do

1143
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:59,280
you work with the security champions and

1144
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:03,180
with their teams to map onto this and I

1145
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,670
will say we found it again being very

1146
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,020
limited resources on product security it

1147
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,790
can be a little bit overwhelming to try

1148
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,470
to go through and verify all this stuff

1149
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,090
so we're currently looking for ways to

1150
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:15,020
streamline this process to make it

1151
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:19,410
something we can do more regularly and

1152
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:21,060
then finally reflect and iterate with as

1153
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,160
with all things in like the agile world

1154
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,560
you've got to look at what you're doing

1155
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,810
but it periodically you know take that

1156
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,130
time to think about is it working is

1157
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:31,980
there a way you could do it better

1158
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,470
I give that example of our first attempt

1159
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,260
at trying to do code reviews just wasn't

1160
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:39,120
going to happen so we needed to stop

1161
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,920
that as quick as possible free up

1162
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,549
people's time and then re-evaluate how

1163
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,589
we can do it better

1164
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:47,390
similarly as if you're using something

1165
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,529
like that maturity model you're gonna

1166
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,879
want to reflect on what are the new

1167
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:53,359
categories that you want to start

1168
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,190
focusing on at some point so if you keep

1169
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,980
all of these things in mind and in

1170
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,290
particular how to sort of customize them

1171
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,119
and incorporate them into your own

1172
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:04,609
culture at your organization then I

1173
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,160
think you can find a way to to build

1174
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:10,130
that partnership between security and

1175
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:13,098
development that helps you scale your

1176
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:17,420
program and helps them move faster

1177
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:21,260
without being as externally reliant on

1178
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:23,359
on the security team I think we may have

1179
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:27,280
just like a minute or two for a quick

1180
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,279
question if anyone has a question

1181
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:43,599
thank you I have a question before you

1182
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:45,579
mention that would be nice if a security

1183
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,150
champion that is moving from one product

1184
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:50,349
team to another team will keep the the

1185
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,529
security champion thing

1186
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:56,980
I mean role my now my question is Bonnie

1187
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:58,569
will move if in the new prod in the new

1188
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,240
product team there will be already a

1189
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:03,880
security champion how will be I mean the

1190
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:07,689
new upcoming guy will be like a system

1191
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:12,220
security champion or yeah yeah

1192
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:15,849
so we early on we did sort of identify a

1193
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,200
primary security champion and then sort

1194
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:18,730
of we called it secondary but it could

1195
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,839
also be tertiary or you know however

1196
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:24,730
many we over time we haven't enforced

1197
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:27,788
that as much we've kind of left it up to

1198
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:30,099
them to divide the work typically we

1199
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:32,950
find that the teams don't have a

1200
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:35,349
shortage of work to do so giving them

1201
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,089
the flexibility of deciding so that

1202
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:38,740
based on what it is so if we've got

1203
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:42,130
someone who's been a security champion

1204
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:44,558
on that team longer then if we're

1205
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,630
talking about a threat modeling session

1206
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,279
that we want to do with them they might

1207
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,019
be better suited to it just because they

1208
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:52,710
have the most background if it's about

1209
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:55,779
making some changes in the pipeline to

1210
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,009
change some security scanning that's

1211
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:59,289
probably something either one of them

1212
00:50:57,009 --> 00:51:01,900
can do so so we don't specify one as

1213
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:04,450
primary anymore but they sort of self

1214
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:11,259
select who's appropriate for for a given

1215
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:12,819
task so I think do we have time for

1216
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:18,160
another question or should we go offline

1217
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:23,230
for questions I have a question okay

1218
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:25,660
last question so what you said you have

1219
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,910
two champions ideally three champions so

1220
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:31,269
again if someone moves does it happen

1221
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:33,578
that product manager says like I have

1222
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:35,348
already two champions in the team and I

1223
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:39,160
don't want the third one the fourth one

1224
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:41,589
and one more question how many champions

1225
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,868
you have and does it happen that the

1226
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:47,259
team is so small that it's only two

1227
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:49,119
people are only one person yeah so so

1228
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:50,470
the last question first like we

1229
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,320
definitely have some teams that are

1230
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,200
very small where we may have like two

1231
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,940
local resources who are our security

1232
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,970
champions and then they may have an

1233
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,590
extended team that's or they have like

1234
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:04,450
some staff augmentation for development

1235
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:07,359
or something so we have had that

1236
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,160
situation and we've had both of them the

1237
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,160
security champions which actually is

1238
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,170
really good because that example of

1239
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,730
doing like code review one of our rules

1240
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,710
is you can't be the security code

1241
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:21,010
reviewer of your own code of course so

1242
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:23,859
even if you're a team of two with maybe

1243
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:25,930
staff augmentation it really is

1244
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:27,369
beneficial to have both go through that

1245
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,440
training and be a part of it because

1246
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:31,359
then they can still peer review and they

1247
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:36,700
can review the code coming in from the

1248
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,960
augmentation we've never had anyone sort

1249
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,779
of raise it as a problem that they have

1250
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,910
too many security champions I think

1251
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,510
largely that's because we do make it

1252
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:49,569
such a point of limiting how much time

1253
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:52,420
we ask for we try to introduce all of

1254
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:54,369
this stuff into the existing meetings

1255
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,950
that they're having we try to be really

1256
00:52:54,369 --> 00:53:00,310
respectful of asking for security

1257
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:02,740
champion time so it's only every now and

1258
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,359
then you know we've only ever asked for

1259
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,859
like a full two day chunk of a security

1260
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:08,529
champions time for that internal

1261
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:10,420
training once per security champion and

1262
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,369
so as long as they have the flexibility

1263
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,750
not to say okay I've got four people

1264
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:15,880
from my team that are all going to be

1265
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:19,060
gone for two days it really hasn't been

1266
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,440
a problem so and inevitably at least

1267
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,020
with our organization people do move

1268
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,619
around over time so even if there's four

1269
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:28,089
on a team today that may mean that

1270
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,589
there's enough other developments on

1271
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:32,650
that there's enough that's such a big

1272
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:35,230
team that is still proportional or it

1273
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,880
may mean that over time it's gonna

1274
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,820
flatten out anyway as two people move

1275
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,070
around again so so thank you I will be

1276
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,359
around if people have further questions

1277
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,390
you can meet me in the back of the room

1278
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:49,630
but thanks very much

1279
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,629
[Applause]
