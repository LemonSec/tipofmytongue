1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,429
hi so this is a measured response to a

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,750
grain of rice I'm Joe Fitzpatrick you

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,639
can find me on Twitter at securely Fitz

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,830
this is my first time the black hat

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,268
Europe which is pretty cool I'm glad to

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,949
be here I've been to the black hat

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,869
United States a few times but that's

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,810
very close to home for me so I was glad

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,009
to make it out here I have about 15

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,169
years of experience playing with

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,539
hardware that includes starting out

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,840
doing silicon debug I was doing a speed

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,420
debug of desktop and server CPUs from

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,890
that I moved more into hardware pen

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,050
testing pre and post silicon of chips

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,730
and while I was doing that I moved into

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,078
the training side I there were a lot of

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,879
people who had a lot of background in

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,160
hardware and functional validation

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,379
making things making sure things work

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,819
the way they were supposed to and I kind

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,949
of tried to help people understand how

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,899
to pick out the hardware security bugs

24
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,420
that they should be you know flagging as

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,390
well instead of just looking at things

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,420
from a purely functional perspective I

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,129
do own a pair of shoes that have LEDs

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,930
inside of them and a shirt that is sound

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,369
sensitive and has LEDs inside too and

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,180
yes that's at a conference I was at work

31
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,650
when I took that picture I now for the

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,470
past six years have been doing training

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,810
I teach classes I've taught at blackhat

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,060
us several times applied physical tax

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,890
training on embedded systems x86 systems

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,650
these are all about using your hands to

37
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,960
hook wires up and undermine the security

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,159
of systems by using physical access so

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,740
before we go any further I do want to

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,659
put some disclaimers in here I think

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,670
this image summarizes it pretty well I

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,470
don't know about about Hardware implants

43
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,420
but I got a buddy named Joe who does so

44
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,579
let's give him a call I don't know if

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,880
you know the mean but this is a from a

46
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,679
TV show that I've never actually seen

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,679
about pawnshops and this guy you know at

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,659
a pawn shop often has people he calls so

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,490
it seems like I'm the guy who people are

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,200
calling about Hardware implants since

51
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,520
for some reason in the past two months

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,610
people are a little more interest to

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,110
them in them than they were before I've

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,229
played a lot with Hardware implants over

55
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,830
the past several years but I'm Joe I do

56
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,810
this for fun essentially I do this solo

57
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,040
by myself I don't work for a government

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,769
agency

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,989
I know that there are a lot of people

60
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,940
out there who do do this professionally

61
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,650
whose jobs are to build these hardware

62
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,450
implants that might go in servers or

63
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,860
telecom systems or anything else but I

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,109
don't think you're gonna get any of them

65
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,750
to come and talk to you at blackhat so

66
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,540
unfortunately I'm just Joe I'm what you

67
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,310
get so you know know that what I'm

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,220
talking about is from my own experience

69
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,870
building things and creating things and

70
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,209
not necessary from the perspective of

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,340
someone who is funded with several

72
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,250
millions of dollars and has signed their

73
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,400
life away on all sorts of government

74
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,700
forms and whatnot so what is a hardware

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,140
implant I'm using this word perhaps some

76
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,959
people aren't sure what I mean by that

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,790
the first time we we see this word this

78
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,510
term of implant used a lot is around

79
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,790
2013 it was used a lot in all the leaked

80
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,220
documents from Snowden covert implants

81
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,980
software implants Network implants these

82
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,090
are essentially malicious bits of stuff

83
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,959
payloads code whatever that is used to

84
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,880
generally do surveillance type

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,910
operations right so these are

86
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,739
intelligence agencies who want to get an

87
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,299
implant into a server so they can

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,919
monitor what's on that so they can have

89
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,750
a way of collecting intelligence off of

90
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,880
this device hardware implant came into

91
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,739
more common use around 2013 at the end

92
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,168
of the year when Der Spiegel published

93
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,900
an article about the ant catalog this

94
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,780
was a purported leaked document that had

95
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,060
several pages that described little

96
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,510
malicious hardware devices that could be

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,599
implanted into servers into mobile

98
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,980
devices into cables that would give

99
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,879
Hardware access to those systems so

100
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,410
historically when we think of Hardware

101
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,929
implants we think of Hardware attack

102
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,760
devices the basic classical example is a

103
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,139
keystroke logger this is a USB keystroke

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,239
logger you plug it into your USB port

105
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,780
you plug the car you plug into someone

106
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,010
else's USB port I would never do that

107
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,480
but apparently that's what people do

108
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,548
plug it in someone else's keyboard and

109
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,589
their USB port and it logs all the

110
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,940
keystrokes that go through you retrieve

111
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,859
it and then you can retrieve all the

112
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,080
keystrokes that were stored on it they

113
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,240
even made these so old that they came in

114
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,870
like ps2 connectors and and 5-pin din

115
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,330
connectors

116
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,860
before we even had USB but that's been

117
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,599
around for four decades at this point

118
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,580
the other thing that's been around is

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,820
mod chips who's ever played on a game

120
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,599
console before who's ever played like a

121
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,250
game on a game console before okay so

122
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,020
apparently you know once you once you

123
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,639
modify and solder things onto your game

124
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,969
console you can still play games with it

125
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,860
too

126
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,389
I don't know that's the fun part is the

127
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,130
soldering these mod chips on they

128
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,930
basically change the way the device

129
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,490
works so that you can do things the

130
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,199
manufacturer of the hardware didn't

131
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,750
intent this is a hardware modification

132
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,400
you know the model is a little different

133
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,720
because the attacker is now the owner of

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,049
the system as opposed to the attacker

135
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,990
being not the owner and the the the

136
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,880
malicious agent on the system but we get

137
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,850
the same types of devices the same

138
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,039
examples of what we're looking at we

139
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,500
also have counterfeit bypass devices

140
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,210
this is a photo that someone posted on

141
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,510
reddit a few years ago saying hey I

142
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,969
bought a bunch of switches on eBay or

143
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,729
some other strange source of equipment

144
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,199
and I found one that I took apart and it

145
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,020
had this weird chip stuck on the bottom

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,240
anybody know what this might be and you

147
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,430
look at it and of course the reaction to

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,919
post 2013 is like oh my gosh it's

149
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,139
implanted you know you have spyware on

150
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,750
your system but no this is just a by a

151
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,120
counterfeit bypass device you buy a

152
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,650
switch you pay for the number of ports

153
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,620
you have on it and or the speed or

154
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,419
configuration of it if you want to be

155
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,560
malicious and make money what do you do

156
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,960
it you take a bunch of the cheap

157
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,370
switches you put a bypass device on it

158
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,750
so that suddenly they work as the

159
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,370
expensive switches you change the

160
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,660
sticker on the front you sell them to

161
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,289
people who are willing to buy stuff on

162
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,900
eBay and you profit right again we still

163
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,789
don't have Hardware implants that are

164
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,120
being manufactured and used by

165
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:16,830
intelligence agencies so this is a

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,669
project that I work on with a friend of

167
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,190
mine killa okay Mike and we made the do

168
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:25,830
B key so on the left which way is left

169
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,260
on the right you have an actual Yubikey

170
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,969
and I got a free Yubikey at a conference

171
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,190
and I thought oh this is great I wonder

172
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,010
if it's real how do I go verify that

173
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,539
it's real I go to UB Keys website you

174
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,180
because website they say Oh does it have

175
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,849
a serial number like does it say powered

176
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,370
by UB come on the back then it's real

177
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,290
I can fake that so we invade our fake

178
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,060
dooby keys we're the ones on the left

179
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,130
and you can see that the case on the

180
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,780
dooby key is not as good as the case on

181
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,640
the Yubikey yet but we're still working

182
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,630
on that it also has a programming part

183
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,460
of the board which hasn't been snapped

184
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,440
off yet but we made these devices to

185
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,060
show like yeah we we get these hardware

186
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,680
security devices and we don't really

187
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,780
have a good understanding of what

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,340
hardware security means because again

189
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,440
there are a lot of people who receive

190
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,619
those those free UV keys at a conference

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,630
off about of a bowl at a table and don't

192
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,610
have any reason to believe they should

193
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,640
be suspicious of the supply chain that

194
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,260
got them to them another example from

195
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,750
last year or two years ago is this the

196
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,950
RSA token so you know you have an RSA

197
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,140
token if you flip it over you'd see a

198
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,780
little display with a six digit pin that

199
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,969
you type in when your login I flipped it

200
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,859
over took the back off and I soldered on

201
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,140
that little extra board which has a

202
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,330
bluetooth module right so you take an

203
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,400
off-the-shelf hardware device you open

204
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,260
it up you add some extra parts to it and

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,580
suddenly it's Bluetooth enabled which is

206
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,800
like what everybody wants right so it

207
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,270
broadcasts a six-digit to every 60

208
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,670
seconds it broadcasts your 6-digit pin

209
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,870
so everybody can listen to it or you can

210
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,590
pair it with your computer and it types

211
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,150
it in for you

212
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,919
which you know whatever and then even

213
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,560
further along we've got these lots of

214
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,960
examples of skimmers so these are a

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,920
series of skimmers that were found in

216
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,200
gas pumps in Colorado Sparkfun is a

217
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,360
supplier of like hobby electronics type

218
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,890
stuff and they were asked to go and take

219
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,750
a look at some of these and these are

220
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,450
basically really cheap off-the-shelf

221
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,370
devices you can buy them for roughly $5

222
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,039
you can actually buy them assembled as

223
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,480
skimmers for $5 pre-programmed and what

224
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,860
would happen is someone would get one of

225
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,810
these or they would be given one of

226
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,430
these and say hey go go plug it in that

227
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,590
gas pump you know open this service

228
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,970
panel and plug it in the socket and then

229
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,590
all you have to do is go back every

230
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,360
couple days pull out your phone pair

231
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,189
with it over bluetooth and it downloads

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,409
all the credit cards that have been

233
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,570
scanned at that gas pump right these are

234
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,640
all methods of manipulating hardware

235
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,410
devices using up their hardware right

236
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,750
that really and for most part doesn't

237
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,819
leave a software a trace right we think

238
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,830
about everything we do everything we

239
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,710
have systems of logging and detection

240
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,660
for we're always counting on software to

241
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,680
leave a trace or network access to leave

242
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,430
a trace so these

243
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,890
ways to avoid that so let's talk

244
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,500
specifically about USB hardware tax so

245
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,240
USB is kind of the easy one everybody's

246
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,160
heard about how oh don't plug in a

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,550
random USB Drive you don't know what it

248
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,260
is

249
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,170
well how did we get to this point and

250
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,399
why do we still do it anyway I mentioned

251
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,170
before we've got these keystroke loggers

252
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,580
you know you plug it in the USB port you

253
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,260
get all your keystrokes that come

254
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,649
through you retrieve it and you get the

255
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,149
can get those keys later

256
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:25,920
so there's also specifically programmed

257
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,230
devices they are designed to be

258
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,640
malicious USB devices we've got in the

259
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,320
middle the USB rubber ducky which

260
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,819
focuses on a lot of keyboard type

261
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,040
attacks you plug it in it plays back a

262
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,529
series of keystrokes that will open up

263
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,209
terminals and type commands on the left

264
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,529
you got the bash Bunny which is similar

265
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,540
except it shows up as a USB network

266
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,880
device and it does a few network based

267
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,730
attacks again these are hardware devices

268
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,380
you can buy for pretty reasonable prices

269
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,470
you can carry them to computer you plug

270
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,870
them in and have a surprisingly high

271
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,270
level of success at exploiting systems

272
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,890
with these but again these are these are

273
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,790
purpose-built devices they're designed

274
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,350
specifically to be attack devices if

275
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,810
you're around tomorrow tomorrow morning

276
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,430
Luka is going to showing off the the W

277
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:14,400
hit injector this is essentially a USB

278
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:17,550
what's it called rubber ducky it does

279
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,699
hid and other attacks but it's connected

280
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,199
to Wi-Fi I believe it's also a GSM

281
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,570
version so you can remotely do these

282
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,860
these Bluetooth these USB attacks once

283
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,480
you've plugged this device into your

284
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,220
system right we're talking about ways

285
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,360
that we're expanding the hardware

286
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:36,990
ability to access and proxy physical

287
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,670
access to systems bad USB was pretty

288
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,560
interesting basically there's this

289
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,920
chipset the fission chipset you find it

290
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,300
on USB drives and it's a chipset it's a

291
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,430
SOC a system-on-chip

292
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,069
it's got a core that's programmable it

293
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,319
stores flash and it gives you access to

294
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,120
the the NAND flash the big volume of

295
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,070
flash on the other side that implements

296
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,750
the USB Drive you can reprogram this

297
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,910
sometimes these are sold off the shelf

298
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,550
without the the the reprogramming

299
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,380
ability being taken away so sure enough

300
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,779
you can take an existing device off the

301
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,640
shelf modify it with just software and

302
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,630
now you have a malicious hardware device

303
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,120
that isn't even

304
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,930
a fabricated device it's a tamper -

305
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,130
modified existing device USB is even

306
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,770
more exciting from the attackers

307
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,870
perspective right you've got this port

308
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,610
that instead of just being USB it also

309
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,920
carries your display it also carries

310
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,660
Thunderbolt 3 it can carry all sorts of

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,199
different alternate data streams over it

312
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,180
as well this is two examples of USB see

313
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,310
to display adapters the one on the left

314
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,130
is the Apple one which costs about 80 US

315
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,900
dollars you plug it in to your USB C

316
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,140
port on the other side you have an HDMI

317
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,150
port a power port and a USB output right

318
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,949
but if you look at it you've got a lot

319
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,959
of chips on there and I believe on the

320
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,270
opposite side from that diet that

321
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,820
picture you've got a JTAG header for the

322
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,590
chipset that is on there JTAG being a

323
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,130
debug port you can go and reprogram the

324
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,140
firmware

325
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,200
luckily the latest firmware is lockout

326
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,310
JTAG access so you may not have to worry

327
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,380
about that unless someone goes and

328
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,910
resolder x' the replacement chip on

329
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,460
there without JTAG just enabled I'm

330
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,900
sorry disabled details on the right you

331
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:15,660
have an inexpensive $20.00 USB USB C to

332
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,189
VGA adapter and you see three chips on

333
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,420
that little board and I don't know if I

334
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,820
can highlight them well enough but

335
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,949
you've got the biggest chip is basically

336
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,760
what turns the DisplayPort signals off

337
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,710
of the USB into VGA signals so it's kind

338
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,420
of a passive analog chip then over here

339
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,740
you've got a very tiny chip that's a USB

340
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,930
power delivery chip that's telling the

341
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,140
system to give it power says oh I'd like

342
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,959
5 volts at 3 at 500 milliamps or I could

343
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,449
say I'd like 20 volts at 3 amps all

344
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,890
software and then lastly as this chip

345
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,810
right here that the middle middle sized

346
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,870
chip in the corner and that's a USB

347
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,400
micro controller I open this device up

348
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,050
thinking I would have to find a pin to

349
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,060
short out to reprogram this micro

350
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,729
controller sure enough it turns out it

351
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,709
was by default reprogrammable all I had

352
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,210
to do is plug this into a USB port and I

353
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,450
could go ahead and rewrite the firmware

354
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:06,210
on the USB side of my display adapter so

355
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,730
I chose to program it to also show up as

356
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,130
a USB HID device so I plug it in the

357
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,420
screen shows up and suddenly random

358
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,740
keystrokes got to start getting entered

359
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,380
while I'm presenting and slides flip

360
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,970
around pretty annoying but it's one of

361
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,770
those things you can't do you can't tell

362
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,490
just by looking this device what's

363
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,930
inside so even further along you know we

364
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,640
have these devices that we previously

365
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,040
thought were passive like output only

366
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,260
devices we've got the point where we

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,990
have lightning cables that have enough

368
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,720
extra space in the housings that you can

369
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,410
put a malicious USB device inside of

370
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,600
them a friend of mine mg has a series of

371
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,719
videos on his on his Twitter account

372
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,820
where he basically in the little housing

373
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,760
of this cable is able to put just enough

374
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,950
logic to playback a USB series a series

375
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,540
of USB interactions so you don't even

376
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,740
realize you're just using a cable and

377
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,149
this cable can be malicious and this is

378
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,220
all like kind of the high point of this

379
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,110
that I've encountered is this Cape this

380
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,390
is a seven dollar cable that I bought

381
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,149
from China and you look at it and

382
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,640
there's a media tech arm CPU right here

383
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:13,110
and the reason is because this USB cable

384
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,300
inside that housing which is no bigger

385
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,190
than a normal USB cable has a cellphone

386
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,640
module it has a slot for a SIM card

387
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,320
right and it has a microphone right so

388
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,120
all the previous USB attacks were

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,220
focused on interacting with the system

390
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,200
this one doesn't even bother this is

391
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,700
completely decoupled it just gets power

392
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,470
from the system so you hand someone a

393
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,000
USB cable and say oh here use this to

394
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,260
charge your phone and they plug it in

395
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,940
and they're charging their phone or they

396
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,860
leave it in their car and use it to

397
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,839
charge their phone or listen to music on

398
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,120
their phone and the whole time it's

399
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,430
powered on it's on the cellphone Network

400
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,870
it's reporting its location and when you

401
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,140
call the device you can open up a hot

402
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,820
mic and listen to what's going on write

403
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,380
a theory that I have not yet you know

404
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,420
proven is the fact that when you plug

405
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,010
this thing into your laptop it's close

406
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,709
enough to your laptop that you would

407
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,360
hear the tap of keystrokes right timing

408
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,369
analysis would be able to let you use

409
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,020
this cable to figure out what keys are

410
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,570
being pressed without even electrically

411
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:10,160
sorry logically being coupled to your PC

412
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:13,170
so it's pretty amazing to me what is

413
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,949
possible with just USB right and we're

414
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,170
only scratching the surface here so how

415
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,579
else could we connect a hardware implant

416
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,979
so let's say we want to make a malicious

417
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,899
device we can hook up to USB or external

418
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,370
ports that's the easiest way but they're

419
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,020
kind of obvious because you see a little

420
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,820
little thing sticking out of a port on a

421
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,029
PC so you you don't want to do that if

422
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,550
you're trying to be covert in any way

423
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,079
inside the system we've got PCI Express

424
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,410
how many of you have extra slots that

425
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,930
you're not

426
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,779
using a desktop system probably most of

427
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,810
you you've also got on laptops most

428
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,639
Wi-Fi modules are removable lots of SSDs

429
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,619
are now removable those are PCI Express

430
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,019
attached devices so even in a laptop

431
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,050
you've got spots where you can plug in

432
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,759
extra hardware what's also really neat

433
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,099
is you can tap internship communication

434
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,509
on a regular system you've got tons of

435
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,310
devices that are all communicating to

436
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,769
each other and every single one of them

437
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,268
has a protocol they speak if you're able

438
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,889
to access the wires that connect to

439
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,360
chips you have no reason there's no

440
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,129
reason why you couldn't sniff that

441
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,500
protocol there's no reason why was a

442
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,269
little more modification to the system

443
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,819
you couldn't intercept and man in the

444
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,129
middle of a protocol and lastly you've

445
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:21,899
got debug headers right when boards are

446
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,699
manufactured they're manufactured and

447
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,230
tested they go through a qualification

448
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,399
process and then finally someone says

449
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,709
this this board is done let's

450
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,480
manufacture it for production and no

451
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:31,949
one's gonna go and do another revision

452
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,050
of the board and remove all those debug

453
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,189
headers because that's extra risk you

454
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,529
don't have the ability to go back and

455
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,849
debug stuff that went wrong so you often

456
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,379
have debug headers on the board if you

457
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,410
could just tap on to those debug headers

458
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,509
and pins with a malicious device you

459
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,939
could go back and play a series of debug

460
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:50,250
commands to modify that system in in

461
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,930
operation so when we could talk about

462
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,279
hardware we've got we've got entry

463
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,800
points we need these entry points to get

464
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,540
into the system but how many do we have

465
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,990
so this is a what we might see inside of

466
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,990
a server

467
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:07,650
this photo is diagram is from AST this

468
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,569
there are manufacturers of BMC board

469
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,919
management controllers and on the left

470
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,059
side we see the board managed controller

471
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,459
on the right side we see that the

472
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,678
classic CPU Northbridge Southbridge

473
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,419
setup and these days it's kind of

474
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,809
all-in-one Northbridge Southbridge but

475
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:24,089
don't worry about that we see we've got

476
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,709
network connectivity our Mir GM III

477
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,000
right those are connectivity is between

478
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,780
the chip and the physical layer of the

479
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,450
network we've got USB 2 2.0 1.1 we've

480
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,970
got PCI Express connectivity LPC which

481
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,070
is a low speed version a low pin count

482
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,320
version of an ISA bus we've got UART

483
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,809
we've got sd card slots we've got

484
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,049
additional NIC connections as well as

485
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:48,720
display and serial ports so we've got

486
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,850
tons of opportunities to hook up wires

487
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,039
to this system to base

488
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:57,539
Stickley maliciously modify its

489
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,400
operation so when do these hardware

490
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:03,750
tacks make sense oh I gotta speed up

491
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,120
quite a bit so what if you have airtight

492
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:12,390
security practices you have employees

493
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:14,370
who are involuntary attacks you have

494
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,230
perfect network security then hardware

495
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,299
makes sense if you're dealing with air

496
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,220
gap system systems that are not on a

497
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,230
network that are not couple in any way

498
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,270
then it makes sense to have a piece of

499
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,510
device that is what is your link between

500
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,650
this and the outside world sometimes you

501
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,908
actually do a decent job you have a

502
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,400
heavily monitored network for any

503
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,289
various reasons sometimes you have

504
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,880
industrial control type scenarios where

505
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:38,100
you have these data diodes that are very

506
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,409
careful about letting data only flow in

507
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,360
certain directions sometimes you just

508
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:45,150
have a very rigid policy that doesn't

509
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,860
let outside access happen so again

510
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,720
physical access is a way to get into

511
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,570
these systems that wouldn't be otherwise

512
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,669
remotely accessible and of course supply

513
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,649
chain if you have access to the supply

514
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:58,169
chain if you have access to how the

515
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,750
hardware gets into the the target system

516
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:02,280
then you have access to that to the

517
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,140
firmware that's on that Hardware the

518
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,418
extra components where those components

519
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,220
come from and supply chain isn't just a

520
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,049
one-stop thing this is the supply chain

521
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,700
of your boards the supply chain of your

522
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,010
chips the supply chain of your passive

523
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,110
components the supply chain includes how

524
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,129
these devices are shipped around and how

525
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,649
they're assembled where they're

526
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,150
assembled once you've manufactured a

527
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,610
board with all its components on it and

528
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,049
you ship it to the end end user where

529
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,780
does it go is it sit in a warehouse

530
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,309
until it's it deployed when we go to the

531
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,990
situation with voting machines right

532
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,340
there's a lot of talk about how voting

533
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,470
machines are so secure because they're

534
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,299
only used on a certain day of the year

535
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,340
and the rest of the year they're stored

536
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,720
in a closet in the school where the

537
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,209
voting happens at least in the United

538
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,390
States sure it's very different here but

539
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,490
again perhaps it's different here but

540
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,990
again you know the no one thinks about

541
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,669
the security of the physical security of

542
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,380
these devices because it's a box it's a

543
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:55,919
heart it's a piece of hardware that they

544
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,390
kind of think of as immutable when it

545
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,490
comes to a Hardware attack if you are

546
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,929
able to implant a hardware device right

547
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,929
there's no network logs there's no

548
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:05,820
traffic there's no backwards

549
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:07,379
observation that can happen perhaps

550
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,299
you've got surveillance cameras that's

551
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:10,799
kind of a different story but there is

552
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,720
this deniability that comes with a

553
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,980
hardware device expect especially if

554
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,149
it's an off-the-shelf type hardware

555
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,100
device and last exfiltration if you're

556
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:22,139
on a network where you're very careful

557
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,939
about what data gets out are you also

558
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:27,570
careful about what hardware leaves and

559
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,429
how it leaves I heard a story it is just

560
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,619
a story and as a multi hand story so I

561
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,240
don't know how factual it is but you've

562
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:36,059
got memory modules and memory modules

563
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,279
have a very tiny piece of Flash on them

564
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,049
that let you program the parameters of

565
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,149
that memory module and there was a

566
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,950
report where system had memory modules

567
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:45,658
that kept failing tests and so the

568
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,269
memory module was packaged up and sent

569
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,950
out to RMA and in that process

570
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:51,690
someone was caught trying to steal these

571
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,929
memory modules from the mail room

572
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,590
turns out apparently legend story there

573
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:00,629
was data on these on these little SPD

574
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,509
flash modules on the memory modules that

575
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:05,189
was exfiltrating data so hardware access

576
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,429
gives you an interesting way to get data

577
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,409
off of a system lastly if we've got

578
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,899
vulnerable Hardware if we have a bug in

579
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:14,850
a space of silicon it's pretty tough to

580
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:17,100
fix that it definitely doesn't get fixed

581
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,119
in a quick way and you generally don't

582
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,879
want to destroy your hardware just

583
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,899
because it has one bug what that means

584
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,820
though is we might have a situation

585
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,498
where our hardware vulnerabilities are

586
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,480
baked in and known to be good for

587
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:29,549
several years whether it's five years or

588
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,480
thirty years if we've got vulnerable

589
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,799
hardware that's always gonna stay

590
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,169
vulnerable we don't have to worry about

591
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,899
a patch or a software update that fixes

592
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,129
it then we've got an easy way and like I

593
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,709
said unpatch noblemen or abilities

594
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:42,360
format as well what's also interesting

595
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,039
when we go to the lower layers of

596
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,508
hardware the the deeper we bury

597
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,970
ourselves into the hardware the harder

598
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:50,399
it is to detect right it's just like in

599
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,230
software realm if we have a malicious

600
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:53,610
process the operating system can observe

601
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,379
that if we start tampering at the

602
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,570
operating itself operating system itself

603
00:21:55,379 --> 00:22:00,049
we can't trust the operating system to

604
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,340
report on itself when we have a higher

605
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:04,139
privilege levels or lower privilege

606
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,970
levels depending on which perspective

607
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,699
you're looking at you may have the

608
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:12,090
ability to hide from the operating

609
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,259
system and even an even lower level when

610
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,730
we get down to hardware it's the same

611
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,740
way we have lower levels of hardware

612
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,490
that are pretty much invisible to the

613
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,220
upper layers because

614
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,570
the way the abstraction works and of

615
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,890
course social engineering with hardware

616
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,530
is so much more effective than just

617
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,790
talking on the phone because I mean free

618
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,480
you be keys who doesn't want a free

619
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:32,040
Yubikey right so again like let's put it

620
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,510
back in context why is any of this

621
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,080
relevant why am i if you're talking

622
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:39,570
about these things so what does a

623
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,389
hardware advanced persistent threat look

624
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,990
like right examples we gave were kind of

625
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,130
a you know more homebrew a little D more

626
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,630
decoupled from the system but what if

627
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,330
what if someone had millions of dollars

628
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,790
to go invest in creating the ideal

629
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,030
Hardware implant what would that be so

630
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,710
there's a story the big hack and as you

631
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,500
can see there's a tiny little chip on

632
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,590
the tip of a finger and this story a

633
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,179
news article reported how allegedly

634
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,428
there was this tiny little chip the size

635
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,140
of a grain of rice that did some really

636
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,450
bad things and it was implanted in the

637
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,410
entire supply chain and 30 vendor T

638
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:18,870
companies had found or may have

639
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:22,650
allegedly been on the list to get this

640
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:26,449
malicious implant right and again its

641
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:30,120
device size of the point of a pencil

642
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,320
supposedly did all this stuff and if we

643
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,020
look through the article we see the

644
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,889
technical details which are very limited

645
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,080
something happened at a crucial moment

646
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,429
small bits of the operating system were

647
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,899
being stored in the board temporary

648
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,670
memory and route to the server central

649
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,780
process of the CPU the implant was

650
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,370
placed on the board in a way that

651
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,500
allowed it to effectively edit this

652
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,699
information q injecting its own code or

653
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,179
altering the order of the instructions

654
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,650
the CPU was meant to follow from a

655
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,090
technical perspective this doesn't make

656
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,190
a lot of sense but if you put it through

657
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,020
the journalism filter and like realize

658
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,540
it's written for laypeople we basically

659
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,850
have a description of malicious code

660
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,409
right or manipulating existing code or

661
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,059
maybe you could call return on to

662
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,950
programming kind of the same way because

663
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,800
you're messing with the information q I

664
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:13,530
don't know the point is we've got a

665
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,928
piece of hardware that allegedly causes

666
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,120
some issues in the way the software runs

667
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:22,230
everything and this is a bat this is a

668
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,120
big deal if we look at the example that

669
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,290
was shown in the article we see that

670
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,610
they're talking a lot about super micro

671
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,860
motherboards there's a photo of a super

672
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,850
micro motherboard and targeting

673
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,229
specifically the board management

674
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,360
controller

675
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,000
you have a server you've got your your

676
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,500
x86 CPU that's doing the big tasks and

677
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,540
all the big work connected to lots of

678
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,549
memory and network cards but you've also

679
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,260
got this backside this baseboard

680
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,870
management controllers extra chip

681
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,730
usually an ARM processor that helps you

682
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,830
power up and power down the system and

683
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,150
gives you a virtual terminal so that you

684
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,860
can remotely administer this thing

685
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,110
without having to walk down the aisles

686
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,360
of servers to get to the ones who ever

687
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,309
you actually want to talk to so number

688
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,530
one is that chip the a speed a CPU

689
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:03,090
system on chip it's got an arm core as

690
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,460
well as all that connectivity we saw on

691
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:08,490
a block diagram a couple slides back on

692
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,100
the far left we have a flash chip number

693
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,600
two this is a I believe this flash chip

694
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,428
is connected to a speed controller it

695
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,439
has all the firmware this controller is

696
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,690
actually gonna run and execute right

697
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,460
down below and the bottom left is number

698
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,919
three there's an additional flash chip

699
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,690
that's that's the BIOS for the CPU so

700
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,730
when the processor boots up it needs its

701
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,679
own its own UEFI bios whatever it uses

702
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,150
that's executing off of that chip over

703
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,040
there so we have two chips sitting right

704
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,070
here in this like two square inches of

705
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,190
board space that hold code that hold

706
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,320
firmware we look up between the the

707
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,940
cipta the flash chip and this and the

708
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,700
board magical controller we see number

709
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,679
four a little bit hard to see and that

710
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,260
is a spot where there's like eight

711
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,850
little pads love of metal but there's no

712
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,160
chip there it's little white outline as

713
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,780
well as marked um eight that's a spot

714
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,429
where you can actually put another flash

715
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,530
chip and some of these board management

716
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,390
controllers support failover so if one

717
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,040
flash chip seems corrupted it'll go away

718
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,630
from the other sometimes you see this

719
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,700
when you have a board that just

720
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,169
depending on what she was cheaper that

721
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,690
day they'll either use the eight of the

722
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,760
16 pin version of that chip so we've got

723
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,710
an extra spot there and in the bloomberg

724
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,270
article they had an illustration where

725
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,840
that's where they put this grain of rice

726
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:21,059
sized device and then number five I

727
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,320
circled just above the the board

728
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,090
management controller we see a whole

729
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,909
bunch of those little little golden dots

730
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:29,010
those are test points and whenever I'm

731
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,260
dealing with a CPU like if I were

732
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,940
developing a system with a CPU I would

733
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,280
want access ability to its debug

734
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,020
features so my assumption when I see

735
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,059
golden dots right next to a CPU I

736
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,400
probably have a debug port of some sort

737
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,720
right so a little sleuthing you might be

738
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,150
able to figure out what those pins are

739
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,580
what they do a little bit of datasheet

740
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,190
research you'll find details like that

741
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,840
again we are just talking about two

742
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,990
square inches of this board happens to

743
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,459
be a very capable 2 square inches but

744
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:01,260
this is what we can see and what we can

745
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,850
try and do within that little area so

746
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,379
based on this article there was a lot of

747
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,790
reaction of people who are panicking

748
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,680
because we have these little devices

749
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,870
that are the size of a grain of rice

750
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,180
somewhere in everyone's systems or no

751
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,010
one systems we're not really sure how do

752
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,390
we test for them what are we what do we

753
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,220
have what's our indicator of compromise

754
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,430
how do we know that we've been affected

755
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,630
by this issue so open up your case and

756
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,480
look inside do you have grain of rice

757
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,230
sized components on your motherboard yes

758
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,780
you do

759
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:30,360
ok here's the dilemma though that's how

760
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,100
they're made right actually that we have

761
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,889
little flash chips in the background on

762
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,320
this slide but your board is covered

763
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,670
with resistors and capacitors that are

764
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,350
all the size of a grain of rice this is

765
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,450
how we assemble these boards this is how

766
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,520
we get so much complexity into such a

767
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,650
small space so will you see these

768
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,610
components yes are they necessarily

769
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,830
malicious components probably not now do

770
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,929
your boards exactly match the best

771
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,399
schematic you can get of them so this is

772
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,470
assuming you can actually even get

773
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,640
schematics of your boards oftentimes the

774
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,890
data and information you'll get from

775
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,390
manufacturers kind of just a block

776
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,130
diagram or maybe a little bit more

777
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,570
detail about what chips are what and how

778
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,390
they're connected to actually get a

779
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,189
complete schematic right with all the

780
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,030
electrical connections and all the parts

781
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:17,220
numbered is pretty rare and when you go

782
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,660
and double-check things it's very likely

783
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,060
that they're not going to match why is

784
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,220
this right we have engineering change

785
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,899
orders updates and revisions that pretty

786
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,510
much guarantee that by the time your

787
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,400
board gets shipped to you something has

788
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,410
changed from that original schematic

789
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,390
right oftentimes the original schematics

790
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,100
never get updated but what you need to

791
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,200
look at is the schematic plus the stack

792
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,000
of 13 engineering change orders to

793
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,590
figure out what chips are what where

794
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,940
they are what values they are and

795
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,889
whether or not they're pops it or not

796
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,400
very often you'll have a bank of

797
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,840
resistors small little components that

798
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,110
are used as switches to tell you whether

799
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,860
things are configured on or off and

800
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,050
depending on how you want to configure

801
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,879
this specific board because this board

802
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,950
is is one we charged an extra five

803
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,149
dollars for feature for

804
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,340
we just pop a little resistor in the

805
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:04,889
right spot and we enable that feature so

806
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,240
you're really can't count on just a

807
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:08,340
slight difference between your your

808
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,990
billow materials and your board to be an

809
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,730
indication that that something is

810
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,340
malicious from the hardware implant

811
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,500
perspective here's another great one

812
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,379
there's a follow-up article about

813
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,230
Ethernet issues and how there was some

814
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,059
backdoor to ethernet jacks do your duty

815
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,549
do you have metal housings on your

816
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:29,158
ethernet jacks yes you do

817
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:31,168
this article implied that that meant you

818
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,320
had a hardware implant because they were

819
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,769
used for heat diffusion that's not at

820
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,899
all true

821
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,789
nearly every Ethernet jack today has a

822
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,559
metal housing so why they are listing

823
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:42,389
this as an indicator of compromise is

824
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,980
kind of baffling right

825
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:46,500
the reason why they have that metal

826
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,720
housing is to shield the noise that

827
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,309
might come from the transformation that

828
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,880
transformer inside of there so what's

829
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:55,620
the point

830
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,179
what are these implants do so there is

831
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,918
very little description in the article

832
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,309
about like what the actual indications

833
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,990
of something happening was so we still

834
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,820
don't know we don't know what network

835
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,710
activity might have happened that led to

836
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,600
their discovery we don't know where they

837
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,779
were contacting what they were doing so

838
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,389
we have a lot of assumptions we have a

839
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,039
lot of like doom and gloom but we don't

840
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:19,500
have any information so what's the point

841
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,090
right why would someone go to all this

842
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,710
effort to put these little devices on a

843
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,600
board I mean is this component graffiti

844
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,220
graffiti is someone just showing off and

845
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,289
claiming their turf by throwing a

846
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,529
strange component on a board it's not

847
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:33,779
necessarily a surprise that this would

848
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,190
be possible without something else going

849
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,570
on

850
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,159
so the problem right now we have no

851
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,010
useful information to help with

852
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,159
detection since two months ago right

853
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,769
nothing has come up no details so we

854
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,169
also need to be very careful should we

855
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:50,220
really trust anyone who says they do

856
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:52,200
because if they do they probably have

857
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,450
some more information and it'd be great

858
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,149
to have that information but otherwise I

859
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,159
think it's kind of a a good indication

860
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,299
of someone just trying to take off take

861
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,010
advantage of the opportunity an

862
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:05,129
ambulance chaser or snake oil salesman

863
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,730
whatever you would like to call them so

864
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:12,870
is this real or is it a hoax

865
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,520
I don't know right I will say that

866
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,340
you blatantly I don't know I don't have

867
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,879
enough information I am no expert beyond

868
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,530
my own research however the question

869
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,860
that I can answer is this possible

870
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,180
right yes I absolutely think that the

871
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,100
things that were described are

872
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,500
technically possible I'm a technical

873
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,790
person when I see challenges I see an

874
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,430
opportunity to go and implement

875
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,980
something since this was published less

876
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,300
than a month after it was published

877
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,730
cholesky security did a blog post where

878
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,480
they had this little device that went

879
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:48,300
and reprogrammed over the the I squared

880
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,580
C interface a network adapter and showed

881
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,440
that you could basically send undetected

882
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,030
network traffic over I squared C I

883
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,340
squared C is a low speed serial

884
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,750
interface right in this example they

885
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,850
have a USB connected device this is the

886
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,809
Hydra bus there's no reason this

887
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,129
couldn't be implemented in the

888
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,110
microcontroller and there's no reasons

889
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,960
my controllers can't be implemented in

890
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,969
the size not of the size of a grain of

891
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,520
rice but not much larger and in a

892
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,820
package that would be really obvious to

893
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,980
find on my motherboard NCC group did a

894
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,860
great article discussing Hardware

895
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,559
implants and supply chain issues in

896
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,389
addition if you're headed to CCC later

897
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,920
this month Tremmel Hudson's gonna great

898
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,230
have a great presentation where he has

899
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,990
his proof of concept he's gonna examine

900
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,030
the design of a spy bus hardware implant

901
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,559
with similar capabilities of those

902
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,559
described in the Bloomberg super mikro

903
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,990
article these are you know these mod

904
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,910
chips of the state so again we're going

905
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,790
back to these mod chips from game

906
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:47,400
consoles it's kind of where where the

907
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,139
the old art has come from and really

908
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,360
it's what we're doing anymore where

909
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,410
we're modifying an existing system with

910
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,020
some some new useful features so again

911
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,690
is this possible yes but that's not the

912
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,040
question we need to ask right that tells

913
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,190
us what's gonna happen in the near

914
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,399
future but Swift on security who is

915
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,600
clearly a very great authority talks to

916
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,880
US government hackers on their

917
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,800
experience and ask the question how did

918
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,250
Bloomberg find the only Chinese supply

919
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,990
chain hacking story that wasn't true so

920
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm up here telling you that it seems

921
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,080
improbable to me I'm not saying that

922
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,570
it's improbable that there are supply

923
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,189
chain hacking going on I would have to

924
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,679
guarantee there's that supply chain had

925
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,800
no no

926
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,810
but I'm questioning the details of a

927
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,090
story and how we should probably be

928
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,440
properly reacting to this so why would

929
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,419
they use a coupler the device that was

930
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,790
described as his little white chip that

931
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,830
has no place on a motherboard it belongs

932
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,139
on a network a Wi-Fi adapter or a

933
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,330
Bluetooth module or cell phone it

934
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,030
doesn't belong on a motherboard why are

935
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,129
there no first-hand accounts and if

936
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:53,200
there were even second or third-hand

937
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,730
accounts of it existing how come there

938
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,160
was no reports of what it actually did

939
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:59,110
what was the actual end cause did it did

940
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,060
it exfiltrate data did it steal data

941
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,990
didn't manipulate did it blow things up

942
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,460
and catch servers on fire we don't know

943
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,260
so the a in many apts

944
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,570
is often missing the advanced part right

945
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,810
is it realistic for us to assume that

946
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,640
the first half to the first Hardware apt

947
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:17,469
would be an advanced one so finely

948
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,239
polished and tuned that it's a custom

949
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:21,609
chip that was designed in a custom

950
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:23,889
package that was you know sneaked snuck

951
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:26,230
into a specific set of boards for a

952
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,480
specific vendor that's a bit of a

953
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,490
stretch for me

954
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,080
so joecraine had the greatest quote in

955
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,000
the article which specifically said

956
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,819
having a weld on nation-state level

957
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,889
hardware implant surface would be like

958
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,899
witnessing a rainbow rainbow jumping

959
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,989
over a unicorn jumping over a rainbow

960
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:45,069
right this is the type of stuff where if

961
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:47,168
they're actually doing it to this degree

962
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:49,330
you're not gonna find it and if you are

963
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,408
gonna find it it's not gonna be done to

964
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:55,000
this level of perfection so I want to

965
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,800
believe right from a technical

966
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,600
perspective this is so exciting to me

967
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,100
and I'm looking forward to the next few

968
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,319
months where people start proving that

969
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,779
all the technical details are possible

970
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,880
but I can't put any faith behind a story

971
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,980
and afterwards if you come talk to me I

972
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,130
have a bunch of stickers of this so ask

973
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,050
me for one of those so you may say I'm a

974
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,370
trainer I'm not the only one because you

975
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,960
will need to expect I know of at least

976
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,490
four groups of people who are working on

977
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,040
proofs of concept you will see them at

978
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,439
CCC blackhat def comm upcoming issues of

979
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,050
P or C or gtfo so keep your ears out

980
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,670
keep your eyes out for more details on

981
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,210
the technical side of this how is this

982
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,970
possible

983
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,740
how can we make it work but how did we

984
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,930
get here right this is still a little

985
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,279
bit hazy right earlier this year we had

986
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,720
Spectre and melt down they really

987
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,750
changed the landscape in my perception

988
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,850
of how we treat Hardware right this is

989
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,800
a hardware vulnerability but it was

990
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,450
software exploitable right that was the

991
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,280
big difference and this is the first

992
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,560
time we had a really like solid response

993
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,060
to a hardware vulnerability there's been

994
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,740
hardware vulnerabilities in the past and

995
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,320
they're sometimes BIOS updates and other

996
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,000
other mechanisms but spectrum meltdown

997
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,800
had this coordinated response from

998
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,020
nearly every operating system vendor at

999
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,000
the same time across multiple CPU

1000
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,890
vendors at the same time all in response

1001
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,810
to a hardware architectural

1002
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,069
vulnerability this is different from how

1003
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:13,090
we've treated Hardware vulnerability in

1004
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,220
the past side channels between caches

1005
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,960
and you know multi multi-threaded

1006
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:21,459
processors have been known for over a

1007
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,200
decade but only now is a big deal so why

1008
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,280
do people trust their hardware because

1009
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,480
they don't know that they shouldn't

1010
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,860
they've never had the experience to

1011
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,080
think that this piece of hardware is

1012
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,820
actually mutable it's modifiable it's

1013
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:35,049
manipulatable to the same way that our

1014
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,490
layers of software are so the question

1015
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,380
is would anybody listen if we didn't

1016
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,689
have this choreographed disclosure this

1017
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,190
song-and-dance website logo theme and

1018
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,170
all that stuff would anybody pay

1019
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,140
attention to these hardware issues I

1020
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,580
don't think so but now that I have your

1021
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,350
attention because other people have done

1022
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:54,279
this let's talk about the right things

1023
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:56,290
to do so a measured response means not

1024
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,420
like reacting not doing a knee-jerk

1025
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,370
reaction like actually having a logical

1026
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,720
and well thought-out approach in

1027
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,150
response to something that's happened

1028
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,850
right so let's say you go to the doctor

1029
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:10,510
you just read in the news that someone

1030
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:13,000
died from cancer some person of I don't

1031
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,900
know who woody and you go and you say

1032
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,810
the doctor hey let's let's start

1033
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,710
chemotherapy wait wait what's going on

1034
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,090
it's like well I want to start

1035
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,160
chemotherapy so-and-so died of cancer

1036
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,490
and I hear that this is how to fix it

1037
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,930
well why don't we you know do a physical

1038
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,569
checkup see if there's anything wrong

1039
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,250
with you as I go no no no I just I know

1040
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,470
this is gonna fix something so let's

1041
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,970
just do it well you know chemotheraphy

1042
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,620
Swee don't even know if you have

1043
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,270
anything that might be cancer we don't

1044
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,819
know whether it's malignant or or

1045
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:42,940
treatable or untreatable like you know

1046
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,620
well then what can I do what can I do to

1047
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,850
protect myself and the doctor would

1048
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,859
probably say something like well you

1049
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,410
know eat lots of vegetables exercise

1050
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,090
regularly and stay healthy but no one no

1051
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,680
one puts a lot of effort into that right

1052
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,330
they want solution I don't think anybody

1053
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,379
actually wants chemotherapy this is a

1054
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:01,880
obviously a exaggerated example but this

1055
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,030
is the response that people are having

1056
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,920
to this kind of news right you can't

1057
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,770
find something that's not real we don't

1058
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,690
know whether this implant exists or not

1059
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,890
you can look for it you can spend a lot

1060
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,140
of times looking for it and lots of

1061
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,759
money but that's only going to distract

1062
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,370
you from the actual risks you need to

1063
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,800
worry about right think of a hardware

1064
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:23,750
implant as a complement at the opening

1065
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,420
note Jeff Moss mentioned that at the

1066
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,280
executive summit he heard like c-level

1067
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,710
executives bragging to each other about

1068
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,660
who got which apps like attacking them

1069
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,100
which which nations were attacking their

1070
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,720
companies which is a sign of how

1071
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,250
important you are if you've got a

1072
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,169
hardware implant in your system that is

1073
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,120
a compliment right however if you're not

1074
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,800
already defending against apts on a

1075
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,660
regular basis and doing a good job of it

1076
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,540
then you're not ready to worry about

1077
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:51,410
hardware a PT's entirely different

1078
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:54,080
league okay and so an effective attack

1079
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,210
actually does something right can you

1080
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,880
detect malicious software or news

1081
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,950
network activity what I took away from

1082
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,020
the the ant catalog which came out which

1083
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,819
was leaked in 2013 is we had all these

1084
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,170
examples of Hardware implants I'm a

1085
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,940
hardware person and I think about how

1086
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,430
everything can be done in hardware but

1087
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,660
the hardware implants in the ant catalog

1088
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,940
basically were hardware devices that

1089
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,700
gave software access as soon as the

1090
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,860
software took control it was a software

1091
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,200
solution from that point on so if you've

1092
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,330
got the infrastructure to monitor your

1093
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,830
network monitor your software then

1094
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,410
you're gonna detect something when a

1095
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:30,319
hardware device goes and levels up to

1096
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,500
that level of privilege they that's how

1097
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,010
the hardware is going to do it so what

1098
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,390
should we worry about right so you know

1099
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,180
what are the big threats we've got today

1100
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,339
we've got botnets with Dioses and mining

1101
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,990
on people's computers we've got data

1102
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,580
breaches we've got ransomware and and

1103
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,549
crypto and somewhere and all different

1104
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:51,590
variations thereof right all this

1105
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,390
happens from money and disruption right

1106
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:59,300
and the few other scenarios too but

1107
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,890
hardware it has a couple specific things

1108
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,140
that are unique hardware lets you bridge

1109
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,879
air gaps so is there a way to make money

1110
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,950
or cause disruption by bridging an air

1111
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,690
gap that's when hardware might pop up

1112
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,700
right hard

1113
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,589
let's you persist wipes you can erase

1114
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,390
the entire system and somewhere in the

1115
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:15,799
hardware whether it's firmware or actual

1116
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,868
like silicon or other additional

1117
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,720
modification you can persist that wipe

1118
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:22,010
that happen on a persist the wipe that

1119
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,509
happened to that system reinstallation

1120
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,790
of the operating system even reflashing

1121
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,650
of the bios right this is a scenario

1122
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:31,099
where hardware might be a rock an actual

1123
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,770
threat right hardware lets you show off

1124
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:35,390
your capabilities right this is that's

1125
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,980
that corner case that's scenario like

1126
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:40,190
hey if we wanted to just show off that

1127
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,160
we can make this chip that is very tiny

1128
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:45,020
and does things then yeah it's not

1129
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,089
Trinity to show off but it still doesn't

1130
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,099
make sense to go to that level of detail

1131
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:51,500
and a custom-designed chip and a custom

1132
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:55,550
package to just show off that you can do

1133
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,650
it so a typical server will have about

1134
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,200
ten or so components that have their own

1135
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,609
firmware right this is an edition this

1136
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,368
is not including the drives or anything

1137
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:05,930
else this is the the the BIOS flash chip

1138
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,280
you know the hard drive controller the

1139
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,379
network control all these devices have a

1140
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,150
little bit of firmware on them right in

1141
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,770
addition it's going about have hundreds

1142
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,150
of active components these are

1143
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,030
components and whether they're doing

1144
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:20,180
excuse me power regulation or logic or

1145
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,099
anything else they are going to be

1146
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,810
active they're gonna actually do do

1147
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:26,359
things just switch switch current switch

1148
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,890
signals or switch data right on top of

1149
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,200
that you're gonna have thousands if not

1150
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:31,578
thousands of passive components these

1151
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,890
are these tiny little grain of rice

1152
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:35,990
sized resistors that are just buffering

1153
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,970
power that are that are regulating power

1154
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:41,089
throughout the system so you've got a

1155
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:42,470
huge surface to look at if you think you

1156
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:44,299
really need to look down to the level of

1157
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,029
finding grains of rice that are actually

1158
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,680
secret active components this is an

1159
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,930
image from a presentation again I gave

1160
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,700
at blackhat USA two years ago the the

1161
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:55,460
Dow of Hardware the Tay of implants and

1162
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:58,250
this is a stack of Hardware implants

1163
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,619
that I built and aside from the one on

1164
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,940
the far right they all cost a few

1165
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:05,030
dollars the one on the far right was

1166
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,400
like a hundred US dollars the point is

1167
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:09,380
like these are pretty hodgepodge wired

1168
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,339
together things these are hobbyist level

1169
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:16,400
but these are just as much a threat as

1170
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:18,650
these grains of rice that we have not

1171
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,000
been able to see so is it makes more

1172
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,440
sense to look for something that we

1173
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,130
can't see or look for something that we

1174
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,979
can

1175
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,720
so what can we do about it right ripping

1176
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,379
up the servers is probably much a waste

1177
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,149
of time

1178
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,160
right do you have hardware acceptance

1179
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,749
criteria when you order a thousand

1180
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,629
servers or ten thousand or million

1181
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:37,910
servers from a supplier do you actually

1182
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,890
do any review of it do you actually have

1183
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,420
any requirements about what that

1184
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,269
supplier does and where they acquire

1185
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,729
them even as minor as saying oh please

1186
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:48,169
don't buy gray market parts that's a big

1187
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:50,479
step that many companies don't even

1188
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,309
bother or know to take did you look

1189
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:54,890
inside these systems before accepting

1190
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:56,210
them you know it doesn't it takes a lot

1191
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,979
of work to find some of the size of a

1192
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,380
grain of rice but if you open up a box

1193
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:03,109
and find there's extra cards in slots in

1194
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,460
your boxes that's a huge sign that most

1195
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:07,400
people aren't taking the time to even

1196
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,799
look right where did your hardware come

1197
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,109
from right are you sure it actually came

1198
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:14,119
from there right how do you audit this

1199
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:15,859
right do you audit that the hardware you

1200
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:17,869
accept is actually the hardware or you

1201
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,430
ordered and did you order do you audit

1202
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:21,470
that the hardware you order from a

1203
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,140
certain source actually came from that

1204
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,939
source these are important questions

1205
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,670
that are going to go a lot farther and

1206
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,059
actually being a rational response to

1207
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,380
realization that supply chain

1208
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:35,719
vulnerability is is a threat to you

1209
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,609
right have you ever had this discussion

1210
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,609
about supply chain security with your

1211
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:43,160
vendors if you haven't yet don't waste

1212
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:45,589
your time tearing servers apart spend

1213
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,779
your time building understanding with

1214
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:49,249
your vendors understanding of what your

1215
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:51,739
requirements for hardware security are

1216
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:55,839
and collaborating to make sure that your

1217
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:58,489
future systems at least have a realm of

1218
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,999
verifiability to them whereas the

1219
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:03,680
existing ones perhaps do not so do you

1220
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:05,629
consider a five dollar hardware

1221
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,799
attacking your threat model the previous

1222
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,359
example was that where there's gas

1223
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:11,420
station skimmers right

1224
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:13,910
five dollars of hardware stuck into an

1225
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:17,239
exposed port on a gas station pump gets

1226
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:21,379
some one value right does your threat

1227
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:23,690
model consider 100 euro attacks right if

1228
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,450
you have not yet done both of these

1229
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,009
please do not waste your time with fret

1230
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:30,649
modeling for 1 million dollar attacks

1231
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:33,710
because you have to realize that what's

1232
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,810
going to be the problem is is the thing

1233
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,610
that's more likely right would you

1234
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,290
notice a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino

1235
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,970
stuck inside one of your systems these

1236
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,800
are big you know development boards

1237
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,299
these are off-the-shelf parts if you

1238
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,760
don't have a mechanism for identifying

1239
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,950
something like this then again you're

1240
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,780
not making the right uses of your

1241
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,790
priorities when you're looking for and

1242
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:56,140
reacting to reports of other supply

1243
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:59,690
chain issues so why even start looking

1244
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,240
so what's the impact of an attack right

1245
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,760
a lot of the reporting that happened in

1246
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,140
the past two months pointed out that

1247
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,980
basically if you have a hardware implant

1248
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,190
it's game over

1249
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,320
right and the issue is how common is

1250
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:14,900
that attack right because our actual

1251
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,700
risk is a combination of the impact of

1252
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,060
the attack and the frequency of the

1253
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:22,279
attack and so when we deal with more

1254
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,440
common software issues the impact is a

1255
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,300
lot lower but the frequency is so much

1256
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,190
higher so we need to actually consider

1257
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:32,480
the risk when we rate what's important

1258
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:35,780
and what's not so what in summary right

1259
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,490
hardware attacks are a real threat I've

1260
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,770
talked about this many times for the

1261
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,479
past several years so if you want after

1262
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,340
the fact please let me know I can refer

1263
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,620
you to other sources that will give you

1264
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,170
details about what is possible from a

1265
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,460
hardware perspective but you really

1266
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,470
means remember you need to respond to

1267
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:55,610
the threat and not respond to the hype

1268
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:58,450
and that is what I've got for you today

1269
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,450
thank you

1270
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:17,308
we have time for question or any

1271
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:26,368
questions oh it's fun so got a mic

1272
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:28,619
coming I'm not a hardware expert not

1273
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:32,789
even on my hardware implants anything

1274
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:34,109
but to meet a grain of salt that or rice

1275
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:36,660
that you're showing that you know

1276
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:38,819
Bloomberg is showing really looks like a

1277
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:43,140
register or something like that right

1278
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:45,630
has anyone actually been able to like

1279
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:48,089
take high-resolution pictures of those

1280
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,910
images and take a look and compare it to

1281
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:53,400
like existing pictures of registers or

1282
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:56,489
diodes or same thing similar you know

1283
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,239
shaped packages and say oh I've seen

1284
00:46:56,489 --> 00:46:59,779
this before

1285
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,799
so there there's a very well understood

1286
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:04,380
procedure for doing something like that

1287
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:06,299
I don't know if that has been done or

1288
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,799
not that's part of a fact that like even

1289
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:10,319
people who've said that they've seen

1290
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:14,549
these things haven't ever followed up on

1291
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:17,400
like how they observe them analyze them

1292
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:18,929
or anything so if I had one of those

1293
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,689
devices you know I would go through a

1294
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:24,179
process of you know basically a metric

1295
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:25,769
acid2 to find the silicon inside or

1296
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:27,719
x-raying it to find out the structures

1297
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:29,279
inside to see whether or not it's just a

1298
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:33,689
resistor or it actually as an active

1299
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,759
device but again this specific device I

1300
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:37,589
don't know I don't know anything well

1301
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:39,630
we'll see I think very soon some

1302
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:41,788
examples of people putting together

1303
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,069
chips in a larger package that is

1304
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:46,380
indiscernible from the naked eye but

1305
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:50,089
would very easily be identified from an

1306
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:53,160
x-ray or something else yeah look if you

1307
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:55,619
think that it's possible for someone to

1308
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:59,428
build this kind of device would it be

1309
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:03,959
easier to directly inject in one of the

1310
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:06,869
big chips some years that is already

1311
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:09,719
malicious it's the same persons that are

1312
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:11,999
building them so I'm sure you're asking

1313
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:14,759
if it's easy to put like logic VHDL into

1314
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:15,649
an existing chip yes versus modifying

1315
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:17,630
another one

1316
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,910
you know so the story described like a

1317
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:22,460
multi-prong supply chain issue where

1318
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:23,839
they they modified the motherboard they

1319
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,060
modified the build materials they

1320
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,220
modified the components right the thing

1321
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,259
is any one of those things should have

1322
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,910
been sufficient to get the job done like

1323
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,950
the only reason they would do all of

1324
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,540
them is if they were really like intent

1325
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:38,439
on blowing money which is apparently not

1326
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,910
odd for government agencies to do but

1327
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,020
you know when you ask that the question

1328
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,940
you're asking is it would it be easier

1329
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,040
just to go and implant it at the silicon

1330
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,430
level and you know an example the a

1331
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,560
speed BMC right they're all sourced from

1332
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:54,049
China they're all pretty much designed

1333
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,970
in the same place so yeah it might

1334
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,650
actually be easier to go and infiltrate

1335
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,990
the design of a CPU like that just

1336
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:03,050
because it's harder to detect and it's

1337
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:15,620
all in one place so I'm not saying it is

1338
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:19,330
it's totally possible though yeah all

1339
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:21,770
right what's your take on the hallway

1340
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:25,220
discussions that are going on with New

1341
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:28,250
Zealand banning the use and the u.s.

1342
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,350
banning in the UK allowing minute and a

1343
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,930
while with Islam is a bit larger than a

1344
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:36,980
grain of rice but nevertheless is it a

1345
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:39,200
real threat or so my my sort of

1346
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,390
tongue-in-cheek cynical reaction to that

1347
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,850
so a couple years ago the US government

1348
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,230
like asked said hi couldn't why wait

1349
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,150
could not be used in any like government

1350
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,640
and was not recommended elsewhere in the

1351
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,160
US you know basically they're pointing

1352
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,629
out that like they can't guarantee that

1353
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,779
it's free from Chinese government

1354
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:59,810
interference right it's interesting

1355
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,720
because we see evidence that like every

1356
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:04,040
government is doing the same thing right

1357
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,959
different countries maybe have like

1358
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,660
different legal systems and different

1359
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,540
rules for that and maybe are more likely

1360
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:14,600
just to disappear people than others to

1361
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:17,300
make stuff like that happen but I don't

1362
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,610
I don't see how that was any more a

1363
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,010
statement about those companies than it

1364
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:24,980
was about you know US companies or

1365
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:28,500
European companies or you know Japanese

1366
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:31,920
companies or Chinese companies so yeah

1367
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,900
is my cynical response but that's time

1368
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,070
I've got stickers and I'll be around

1369
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,240
here or in the hall if you want asked

1370
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,000
any more questions so thank you very

1371
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,589
much

1372
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,590
[Applause]
