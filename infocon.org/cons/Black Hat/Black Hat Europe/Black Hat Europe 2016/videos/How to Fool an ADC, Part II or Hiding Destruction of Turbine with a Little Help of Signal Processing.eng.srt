1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,009
hello I'm here okay perfect so what

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,240
we're gonna have to start with the talk

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,189
and the topic is how to fool an ADC

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,660
right ascend basically about how we're

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,830
attacking our devices so the talk what

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,289
I'm course speaker with Alexander

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,480
 that I'm getting the manage to

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,960
to come but we're is a work in the both

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,180
of us and bit of introduction we both

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,910
work at them Harbor lab we happen in

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,480
Madrid y-axis Catherine Madrid I guess

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,640
and motor security consultant and we

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,730
both have work in various partitioning

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,980
embedded devices on however however

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,559
hacking so what those are all the games

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,910
in case you want to contact us anytime

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,500
to the door or email that's a spine so

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,710
what would you be VM what I'm I'm gonna

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,949
talk today and since this is about how

20
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,030
to attack and better systems and from a

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,359
pure analog point of view and we have to

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,770
to to study how the ABCs actually work

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,220
so I will spend bit of introduction how

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,170
to spend houses and devices actually

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,350
work and which are is there features how

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,180
to interface with them and they will

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,330
will move to the actual actual attacks

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,630
with assist so and how many of you do

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,210
already know what an ADC is just a bit

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,750
survey okay perfect great and how many

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,159
do you have already programmed systems

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,590
with the ADCs like interfacing with them

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,090
all right perfect

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,840
that's great so for us I'm going to

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,570
start like a more general introduction

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,079
an ADC is the part of the it's a cover

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,530
component that helps the digital system

38
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,820
interact with the analog world right

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,130
ramp basically it's a passive system

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,290
where you can read all this sign okay

41
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,229
it helps you translate what the actual

42
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,780
voltages or the actual measurements are

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,520
you want to for example the temperature

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,180
or coloring or voltage this is the

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,538
narrative translate them the actual

46
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,790
signal into values that can be used in a

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,140
little section so except

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,340
relating to the flawed floating-point

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,080
number that you can then operate without

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,850
in a digital anita manner and this is

51
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,590
really characterized using different

52
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,569
different things and for example the

53
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,510
batwave is the type how much frequency

54
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,940
they can actually read and the single

55
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,410
next video is also important also the

56
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,090
nation parade and all these things are

57
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,150
parameters are someone has to choose one

58
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,709
when you're working with them there are

59
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,620
different types of of a thesis these are

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,750
the more common ones and the these are

61
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,019
the sigma-delta the pipe line there are

62
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,790
here like they are they are group into

63
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,310
which are the conversion rates that they

64
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,239
they usually work so just a simple

65
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,080
supporting so how this ADC will right so

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,280
basically when we have the the one an

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,080
analog signal that we want to read we

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,420
want to know exactly AB which at a

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,430
certain point of day all the time which

70
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,840
value is there because if you are

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,670
something for example the temperature

72
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,190
you want to now subtly put it in the

73
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,260
value but open channel at a specific

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,829
time so this is basically a paragraph

75
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,170
approximation in a point that you want

76
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,530
to read just because a DC it gives you a

77
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,200
value and you keep that value for for a

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,940
while and then the next time you want to

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,810
be the value to go back you ask for for

80
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,630
the another value and she would probably

81
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,049
give you the the most recent value from

82
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,260
the analog signal itself this is like

83
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,120
how a Navy SEAL looks live from a

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,780
functional block point of view which is

85
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,600
this an example for the ID 788 well

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,230
visible common ID sister ID see what is

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,549
inside doesn't really matter right now

88
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,010
they just wanted to point out how they

89
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,530
usually work and they have to two main

90
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,168
interfaces the left one is the the one

91
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,589
that is grouped to the another world

92
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,169
those are called channel so this is

93
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,810
specific ADC has eight channels that we

94
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,720
can like finals or

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,330
or anything that we want to measure if

96
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,420
you are wearing that in our environment

97
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,640
we can probably plug there is design of

98
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,330
with from angina or the temperature all

99
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,490
the voltages that we want to to track

100
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,940
around the system it's going on in our

101
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,850
monitoring device and there the part on

102
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,880
the right is the the one that is cooked

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,920
to the serial port is the interface with

104
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,810
the host the host device which is the

105
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,420
one that actually use these values to

106
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,850
process something let's say we we have

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,530
something which are the voltages on the

108
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,410
other systems because we want to make

109
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,230
sure that everything is working okay and

110
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,420
we want to keep in the console we will

111
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,410
bring the channels and say okay the

112
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,750
voltage for the conversion type is it's

113
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,030
okay the voltage for the motor motor is

114
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,770
fine their voltage for the channel that

115
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,440
controls the boiler is fine so we can we

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,910
can sum up those values and see what is

117
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,840
going on this is an how it looks like in

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,560
a in a real world if the chip is in this

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,840
specific package we have their DM Daisy

120
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,690
I beams all the all the other channels

121
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,360
so it's like a we can have an idea how

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,130
these these things look like and which

123
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,470
is a

124
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,310
the wavy the ADCs helped help us and

125
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,070
really what is in the analog world this

126
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,860
is basically like this is a samurai's

127
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,640
envisioning this slide so we basically

128
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,270
have a voltage reference which helps us

129
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,820
to feel to the system decide which is

130
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,110
the maximum value we can get an

131
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,590
amplitude

132
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,470
right so for example and also describes

133
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,140
each bead because we are going to at the

134
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,460
end of the day which is weren't affected

135
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,590
with we want a digital data we're going

136
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,100
to get a bit streamliner like let's say

137
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,280
ABC has a precision of 12 bits we're

138
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,169
going to get 12 bits worth of data

139
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,710
so it's beep a hatching meaning so we

140
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,720
deal with this calculation we've been

141
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,450
fooled with the whole number we can we

142
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,760
can we can do a simple calculation and

143
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,439
get a big shot

144
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,009
the exact value on that side so divided

145
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,610
by 1 K and we get there based on value

146
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,219
that we are actually pretty so this is

147
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,429
more or less how daily to work and that

148
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,589
someone was to implement a system or a

149
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,199
PLC that has an ADC for routing finals

150
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,679
which is howdy with the parameter point

151
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,869
of view so this is how it works

152
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:07,339
mmm well since we are looking to waste

153
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:08,569
attack this right away I'm gonna

154
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,869
introduce what aliasing is is in we've

155
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,579
probably studied views on the high

156
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:16,429
school or on the university and the

157
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,229
Allies thing is when this is some

158
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,939
distortion distortion on the other

159
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,739
channel by the nautical designer is

160
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,959
wrong because we are not reading it in

161
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,449
the right way right so if you go back to

162
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,879
the to the image that I showed before

163
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,579
and here we can see that we have

164
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,860
sampling the end date impulse I know we

165
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,509
are when we were not gonna we're not

166
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:38,300
doing it right so we have any peace to

167
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,639
the he she can manage to say that I'm at

168
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,089
least we need to sample a sign know two

169
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,919
times the frequency this angle class

170
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,189
right so if the channel has a 1/3

171
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:55,309
frequency at least we should sample at

172
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,929
to health because otherwise we will

173
00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:00,559
gonna get nothing but when even though

174
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,389
two times the frequency is not enough

175
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,429
for all type of signals because if this

176
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,189
angle is too complex or is modulated or

177
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:09,529
something even value to sample try to

178
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,959
then at the double of the frequency of

179
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,239
this I know you won't be getting enough

180
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,069
information of the assign so it has to

181
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,800
be a slightly higher so for example here

182
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,079
you can see that if we are doing it

183
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,209
wrong we are not actually getting any

184
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,649
close to the little design on itself so

185
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,779
this is an how it looks like when I am

186
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,110
between something right and this is

187
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,659
close out we are something a different

188
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,610
different frequencies so we have the

189
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,828
design wave that we want to we want to

190
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,889
actually sample by the we're doing wrong

191
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,480
so we are getting things that are

192
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
completely out of the out of the obviou

193
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,319
we are not accurate enough for for this

194
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,570
and also we

195
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,660
if our increasing the frequency of

196
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,790
something and slightly get getting

197
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,329
closer and closer till it finally and

198
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,310
goes to the to the to the right sign

199
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,399
that BB we have at least divided

200
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,870
fragments so this as we can see if we

201
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,329
don't match the design up we want to

202
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:18,610
sample with the with with a frequency

203
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,079
with a sampling frequency we can get

204
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,579
into this Allium program which will

205
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,649
obviously confuse the system right so

206
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,810
for for avoiding this this is the

207
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,980
implementations usually use the Antilles

208
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,430
until 18 filters which basically diet is

209
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,579
like if we have something at 1k here and

210
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:38,769
we need to put an intelligent filter

211
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,569
that blocks all the frequencies beyond

212
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:44,380
and 100 cards to be sure that we are not

213
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,509
something something about the elitist

214
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:49,060
group right so our input system would

215
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,279
just block with a shelf of the island

216
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,759
this filter will block all the all the

217
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,860
frequencies beyond the range this is M

218
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,220
as we security researchers and security

219
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,949
people we all know that in any system

220
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,350
there is the rule you have to validate

221
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,089
the inputs right if you are in a web app

222
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,010
you have to evaluate any input from the

223
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,459
user

224
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,440
no matter what you have to validate it

225
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,230
so this is more or less the same for a

226
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,560
deceased in a in a pure electrical

227
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,990
immune important point of view so you

228
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,699
also have to validate the inputs because

229
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,860
as we can we will see in the future from

230
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,990
the end leaders and data presentations

231
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,540
it can lead you to problems in there in

232
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:37,180
the with a disease so why is this this

233
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,760
thing important right I mean and

234
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,230
currently we know that we can track each

235
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,269
abilities we can take some sort or PLC

236
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,550
there are conferences in black and all

237
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,260
the computers around the world that so

238
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,970
you have to compromise it till he

239
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,439
assists straight as this thing or

240
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,649
whatever so right now is wearing a point

241
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,290
that the several physical traits are

242
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,500
getting more important which means that

243
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,260
what can happen if we compromise these

244
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,470
PLC and or we compromise a lighting

245
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,220
system could

246
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,540
we put about to burn or two we

247
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
potentially like to be something like a

248
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,280
exploded power plant on thorium or

249
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,790
something later

250
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,340
right because okay you have done a great

251
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,090
job just compromised the plc but what

252
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,550
can happen is just more like a you can

253
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,870
do and you can annoy the operators like

254
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,840
trying to to treat some lights or I'll

255
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
do some annoying things or you can go

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,340
forward and you can cause real damage

257
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,940
right so this is a visitor key point of

258
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,330
the of the of the talks here

259
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,450
well bit is more some simple simple view

260
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,570
of how a control system works that

261
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,400
probably most of you have already now we

262
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,100
have the the physical process could be

263
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,880
bullier could be a misprint motor or

264
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,070
anything anything else we have sensors

265
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,860
that help the system know in which state

266
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,600
we've all the reason which stated

267
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,910
physical processes because we need to

268
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,530
know it we need to know something what

269
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,640
is happening there you know they in

270
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,420
order to to to activate to increase the

271
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,830
temperature to decrease the temperature

272
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,050
to stop the process because it's gone

273
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,090
out of control we have to really know

274
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,830
what is going on there but once the

275
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,950
system routes this we it either produce

276
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,910
an action and that action is a is going

277
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,640
back to the physical process so where we

278
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,030
are focusing we list exactly here on the

279
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,200
sensors part which is exactly the the

280
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,050
place were the ATC Studies on chemicals

281
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,930
for actuators we have the tax the DAC

282
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,900
which is the the opposite of a a of an

283
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,350
ADC but with sovereignty of this talk so

284
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,480
[Music]

285
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,120
the main the main idea behind this dot

286
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
on how to do come for an ADC is not

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,150
house dutiful and ABC actually how you

288
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,690
can fool the system using an ADC right

289
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,900
because the ADC is a passive component

290
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,240
than a you could more or less try to to

291
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,090
play with it but the point is and trying

292
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,310
to fool actually the system behind that

293
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,530
is using the ADC so in a

294
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,509
I mean any ICS system and a SCADA system

295
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,000
you know in a new still control system

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,060
and we can have like this type of

297
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,560
deployment right we have the competency

298
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,160
which is the one that with the data and

299
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,000
then adjust we be finals to let's say we

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,389
have an any spinning motor to increase

301
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,370
the speed decrease the speed or whatever

302
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,560
right so we have an ml o sign out there

303
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,610
and an analyst and you can only have we

304
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,519
have one analyst angled edges so once it

305
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,870
is this voltage all or the same and sang

306
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,089
novel goes to the motor to be or the

307
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,319
heating system to increase or decrease

308
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,290
the voltage and this data systems

309
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,759
usually has been monitoring PLC's

310
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,279
they'll help the system checks whether

311
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,130
and that is actually going well right

312
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,350
because you can have the PLC you can

313
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,389
have everything in place but now when

314
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,459
someone knows to know is is everything

315
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,829
okay all the voltage in the system are

316
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,940
okay and sometimes even if you hack into

317
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,880
PLC and you're able to change things

318
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,449
like I could stop this motor I should

319
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,699
put it to work on these moment to be

320
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:35,260
working or increase the temperature

321
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,120
that's those are things that we already

322
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,970
know can happen but if the design is

323
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,850
well if the design of the system is

324
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,310
properly well done and we have the sixty

325
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,529
control PLC's and the monitoring system

326
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,920
that would raise alarms so what we will

327
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,660
call that someone in the control room

328
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,279
will notice that I would say Oh

329
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,110
something it is simply wrong with the

330
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,300
motor we're going to turn out that PLC

331
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,269
because something is going to happen or

332
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:03,839
they connect right so the point here is

333
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,350
could be possible for an attacker to

334
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,050
actually make the safety control room

335
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,970
seeing that everything is okay when it's

336
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,100
actually not or the opposite think that

337
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,569
everything is wrong when it's actually

338
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:20,079
okay so the focus of this talk is trying

339
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,410
to fool the ABCs or try to make the

340
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,019
systems that grid data for analysis to

341
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:29,230
think things that are no real right and

342
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,870
so we have this situation where

343
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,990
their safety systems a safety PLC their

344
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,970
multiple key things that everything is

345
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,610
fine but we are actually turning on the

346
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,310
be the actuator right we're increasing

347
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,420
the the temperature in the boiler or all

348
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,240
the Christians are making the the motor

349
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,270
speed a very real speed so they can

350
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:57,460
actually be in rock so in this talk and

351
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,270
we have analyzed six different devices

352
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:05,770
with are all Sigma Delta ABCs except

353
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,680
there or my dishes are real PLC that we

354
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,470
don't actually know what it inside it is

355
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,070
no documentation I'd and maybe it is our

356
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,960
IVC but I think it doesn't really matter

357
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,430
here so okay we want to attack this way

358
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,500
okay we want to do this which are

359
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,570
actually actual eyesight vectors for

360
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,420
this so one may my thing like okay do

361
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,250
have the SPI interface so let's try to

362
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,670
to facet or do something fancy on that

363
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,910
but since it's all controlled by the

364
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,089
host and I think this is not much to do

365
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,290
there because if you're really in

366
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,240
control they could do to actually do all

367
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,310
the stuff so we're actually going to

368
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,380
focus on how to attack the ADCs front

369
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,620
two ways purely from the analog world so

370
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,600
we're going to attack them through the

371
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,660
amplitude and frequency so we're going

372
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,360
to start studying it with power on the

373
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,760
amplitude on the ablative all right and

374
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,630
this is a setup that could be any any

375
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,790
PLC we have the VA DC which in this

376
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,010
example we have we are monitoring three

377
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,109
three different channels so we have

378
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,020
three different input input sign out

379
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,990
there and we have the fourth the fourth

380
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,609
channel that we are motoring on the

381
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,189
channel seven that is controlled by an

382
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,439
attacker right so the whole system is

383
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,420
doing what it has to do it has to go to

384
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,850
the to the ADC Bri the data and using

385
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,929
that data make any any action right so

386
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,570
what we are going to do is an we play

387
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,730
with a bit with a with the amplitude so

388
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,560
and the all the data sees we do have

389
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,030
this

390
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,900
this table where the soldier will charge

391
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,910
the valid line ranges of voltage that

392
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,040
you can use with that different channels

393
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,190
so here we're gonna play on the negative

394
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,280
side all the other audio to see what

395
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,350
what actually happens right to the NIGC

396
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,900
when you Maju supply something that

397
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,210
normally is not just to be there

398
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,430
soothing bit right so we have them

399
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,800
recorded if we use two different ABCs

400
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,350
this is the 87 706 and then we use

401
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,650
another another issue which is

402
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,350
integrated in a AVR and another metal

403
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,670
angle device so in this video we can see

404
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,560
that here all the channels right now we

405
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:40,320
can point here what here you don't want

406
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,230
this to be complicated so okay and as

407
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,860
you can see what we did was actually a

408
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,090
plug deal with the power supply we

409
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,920
generated different amplitudes and at

410
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,970
the beginning if we go to you can really

411
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,880
point at the top of the I'll be out here

412
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,990
it's before before injecting any any any

413
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,520
voltage right so we have four channels

414
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,900
and we have 0 0 0 which has pre which is

415
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,830
the amplitude okay thanks which is the

416
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,040
plug flow which is the amplitude that we

417
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,770
are using and and the last value is the

418
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,280
reference level of their of them of the

419
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,810
setup where we have here so if we go now

420
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,870
that we cap is here at this point as you

421
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,010
can see the third channel is the one

422
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,210
connected to the power supply

423
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,070
so what would you with actually a

424
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,530
bluebird giving you quality right so we

425
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,260
can generate a negative sign or event of

426
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
the power supply generate for a positive

427
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
final butter we reverse the order so

428
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,510
version a negative sign of and humic

429
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,430
starting to to to increase appeal so

430
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,890
these are like 30 millivolts and we we

431
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,950
hit data in supposed to on your put a

432
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,530
positive values

433
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,650
just suck it right so this is okay the

434
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,600
only two channels are file but once we

435
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,480
reach we when the 300 millions level

436
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,130
their narrative isn't a more meaningful

437
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,110
level we see that in the other two

438
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,450
channels we are getting reading that

439
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,810
they are actually there so you see the

440
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,850
funny thing we did is that using just

441
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,280
one channel we were able to affect what

442
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,230
is what is we were able to affect the

443
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,380
village from other channels so that's

444
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,020
one of the one of the attacks are am

445
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,350
that you can have with this movie

446
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,710
services and and it is actually in

447
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,320
between is the different initiative

448
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,640
friend and different ABC is one

449
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,880
integrated in the one born so here we

450
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,910
have we the fortified channels are

451
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,940
connected the five volt is a is a

452
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,680
reference and then when we start

453
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,460
injecting the the negative values we see

454
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,200
that at the there somewhere

455
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,800
some were reading some different

456
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,030
channels for example the Wonder was

457
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,500
reading three point five three and

458
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,950
actually be the reference level from

459
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,080
under the eyes diagram we were able to

460
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,690
affect it so instead of reading three

461
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,760
points two point three would be the

462
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,950
actual value we were able to change the

463
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,530
original daily see just attacking a

464
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,050
different completely different Channel

465
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,660
we didn't really need to to access it so

466
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,060
as a summary of a heart attack one IVC

467
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,770
from there from the amplitude side and

468
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,680
what we did was to two for the voltage

469
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,680
into negative values so what we do

470
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,470
practically was a trying to go to the

471
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,990
boundaries of the system so we can see

472
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,430
what happening there so and we saw that

473
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,430
with the a digital tested somewhere this

474
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,740
can happen so for example if someone is

475
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,380
within a temperature and if suddenly

476
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,580
those two to the maximum level it would

477
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,830
write an alarm in the system and some

478
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,240
axis will take place that didn't need to

479
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,910
be taking because the actual China long

480
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,410
they are the channel is okay you're only

481
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,560
affecting how the ADC which that anti

482
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,530
information from the from the world so

483
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,759
as I said

484
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,779
just only one simple channel will enter

485
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,969
the other channels or other signings can

486
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:21,669
be accompanied affected so with the

487
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:24,109
study bits how the amplitude works and

488
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,999
we can attack a system from the

489
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,489
amplitude and now we're going to check

490
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:31,579
side reverse with the frequency right

491
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:35,599
which is the next step so and I'm going

492
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,839
to be do took a video about Delta Sigma

493
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,359
ABCs which can be a bit boring so I will

494
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,690
try to go very fast through it and just

495
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,059
carry either very the very people

496
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:48,979
editing one of the properties of the

497
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:53,419
data that that's my ABCs is that the use

498
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,190
over something of the signing so they

499
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,869
are one of the marketing points of the

500
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:00,469
of the ABCs is that okay then we are

501
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,659
over something there the sign of too

502
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,889
much and that you don't really need

503
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:08,719
artistic anti-aliasing filters that we

504
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,479
go back to the introductions so since we

505
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,149
are something for it 20 times the in

506
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,949
frequency that you are going to to

507
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:18,319
actually read to them you can't relax

508
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,989
that that that requirement so you can

509
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:25,519
have a more broad bandwidth of no

510
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,009
rejection part on there on the ADC so

511
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,659
and it is actually how we support eyes

512
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,389
on the on the market right and since the

513
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,459
sampling frequency is very far from the

514
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:37,339
for the actual expectations you want to

515
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:40,789
to to see you don't need to do to do

516
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:45,619
this reaction of also of frequencies so

517
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:47,659
to achieve this in the end

518
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,399
Delta Sigma has different parts today

519
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,219
and are we going to be fast through this

520
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:54,979
they got a modulator that I am we design

521
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,869
or I'll do some comparing so that the

522
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,819
particles that's all for something very

523
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,859
fast to get a very precise information

524
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,409
of the protein to signal then they

525
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,829
implement a digital low-pass filter

526
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,899
direct injection will be target of the

527
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:12,229
end of what we see afterwards that this

528
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:14,389
blue part is terrorized much the same

529
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:16,789
it's a physical data that cuts some some

530
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,369
frequencies and this is more or less how

531
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,109
illusion for a functional point of view

532
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:24,250
you get an the input signal

533
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,370
it goes where the summer is rate and

534
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,559
what at the end of the day you get a bit

535
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,899
and it goes back it feedback feedback to

536
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:34,360
the to the input to trying to get more

537
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,740
or less what we see here which is

538
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,620
healthy kidded touching my words you

539
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,110
have the input sign on London the output

540
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,330
stream of the end of the dog would be

541
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,720
will be down here and I know it's

542
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,769
function block of how how these how this

543
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:53,200
works on okay forget about it the big

544
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,590
boy

545
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,559
and which is actually the functional

546
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,389
diagram of the of the Delta Sigma ABC

547
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,909
that we are going to attack the 87 706

548
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:06,850
so we can see here the modulator and the

549
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,980
digital filter and this is a PGA which

550
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,179
is a program of gain amplitude but it's

551
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,480
offer it's like a feature of ADC that if

552
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,980
you for example are trying to sample

553
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,830
very weak finals you could actually like

554
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,710
amplify a signal a bit it's just the

555
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,139
number of games that you can set and if

556
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:30,940
helps you get a better resolution of the

557
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,740
of the sign because it amplifies a bit

558
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,889
designer and what either changes the the

559
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:38,919
cutoff or the different filter so it is

560
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,409
tiny analyze I mean it's handy and if

561
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:45,519
you we will be studied at the late so

562
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,590
this is the setup we have for the photo

563
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,750
set up for for this attack so we're

564
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,429
using the Piko scope to the nra finals

565
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:56,370
we are here intersecting with ADC and

566
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,620
here you have the end 87 706 and

567
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,080
interfacing interfacing with that and

568
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,340
this is more or less how we would

569
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,889
perform the the the attack where this is

570
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:13,629
probably not actually attack this is we

571
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:16,029
are trying to identify what would happen

572
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,830
to the system if we start playing with

573
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,620
the frequency right so we we are going

574
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,929
to start sampling from zero to several

575
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,350
megahertz frequency of the other input

576
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,110
signal whether the recorder and do some

577
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,570
static static station on that and and

578
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,029
try to see if everything is okay or

579
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,150
there is any any where things happen

580
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,280
so this is what I I thought before the

581
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,020
the game here so we are going to focus

582
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,300
on this rivet because are this

583
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,559
is part of the M of the cause BM how a

584
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,410
holiday filter so this frequency here

585
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,990
are frequencies Adam when you change the

586
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,410
game besides the corners of the of the

587
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,990
filter there is a point where they let

588
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,090
pass and activities and I generated

589
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,090
noise as we saw in the cornet and when

590
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,440
you have a filter that block is actually

591
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,960
a huge amount of of sino

592
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,600
and then you have what with the filters

593
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,240
are not ideal so you have a pan that is

594
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,980
completely blocks on the initial point

595
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,520
where you can get an anti native noise

596
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,080
alright so this is kept in mind that we

597
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,610
should get at this point and I'm

598
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,080
generating no and we'll see what

599
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,600
happened up so once we greet their game

600
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,670
to choose you need to get more accuracy

601
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,850
of this angles the first corner moves

602
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,220
the panel to the right and instead of

603
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,920
seeing the certitude of perpetuate and

604
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,150
now 76 76 K so it means that all the

605
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,130
frequencies of these planes should be it

606
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,750
should be completely blocked because

607
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,120
it's something on the side of the audio

608
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,890
filters I should be completely blunt all

609
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:54,010
right so with voltage what it says what

610
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,100
it says there so this is explained in a

611
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,050
bit but I was talking before we have

612
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,240
really the diffuser and working area

613
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,870
here and if we have a gain one so we see

614
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,690
here that the ADC would pass some some

615
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,880
input channel to the to the output being

616
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,820
an attenuated and then we have there the

617
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,760
deal one for the second for the multiple

618
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,590
of that I mean this dynamics did the

619
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,940
numbers are different because we're not

620
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,650
using the same to look at the data sheet

621
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,630
is actually two hundred two megahertz

622
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,420
plot and when we see that to to gain to

623
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,940
what happen is that as I said the first

624
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,890
coordinate corresponds to the next the

625
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,720
next one and then thirty one to five all

626
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,030
should be completely blocked so on this

627
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,450
demo we are going to show how this works

628
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,070
so where we have basically on the this

629
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,740
part is the microscope interface

630
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,809
and this is what we are actually and

631
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,690
reading something with there with the

632
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,850
other in the right so and we are

633
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,070
increasing the frequent issue

634
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,300
these are frequencies that should be

635
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,570
okay with a DC so we're generating them

636
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,050
and we are giving them perfectly fine we

637
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,750
have three three charts and we are also

638
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,940
supplying this kind of little beauty

639
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,370
well every kill but we also plug in a an

640
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,990
altitude of 1 volt so we have here it's

641
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,320
offset it out also to be able to get it

642
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,420
right so we're getting to here the sign

643
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,080
on and once we can of the the filter

644
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,400
which are getting out general is at in

645
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,950
reading signage here and what we need to

646
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,050
do is like we're out of the the the

647
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,000
sisters were already out of the

648
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,530
preposition and supposed to be amplified

649
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,309
anything so this is okay we are not

650
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:44,260
having any alien problem so we are

651
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,600
getting noise or we're getting we're

652
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,150
getting richness we can see we started

653
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,300
and increasing the booster increasing

654
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:57,340
the frequency and we get anger in the

655
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,690
videos point where the frequencies are

656
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,530
3-1 to 500 so as you can see that these

657
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,880
are frequencies that should be

658
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,650
completely blocked by the system alright

659
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,230
so where we are actually seeing in

660
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,679
theory that once we get closer to the to

661
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,440
the actual to the actual volume here we

662
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,980
start seeing some some weird things okay

663
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,710
this will be okay but is noise is

664
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,090
perfectly fine when we're able to

665
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,150
control it but one for which the magnet

666
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,330
number of 3 3 1 2 5 4 we see that the

667
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,490
the the ADC is actually reading a

668
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,280
complete different sign of Ibiza

669
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,370
householder cycle that is not in the

670
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,830
system and we are generating the input

671
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,020
panel it's a 31k

672
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,790
sign so this is a very important thing

673
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,490
right because it's like we are

674
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,280
generating a final that would cause a

675
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,160
problem to an actuator but the system

676
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,679
plc would think that it's reading

677
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,290
something completely different so we

678
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,600
managed to using the frequency

679
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,049
to make the safety critical distancing

680
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,549
that a penis are okay or not okay

681
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:12,370
because even the monitoring system is

682
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,019
expecting this type of signal or any

683
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,970
other value that we can generate through

684
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,789
here we would read it animal say okay

685
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:21,460
totally fine but we were injecting

686
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,779
something completely completely

687
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:25,240
different so this is what's happened

688
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,720
here it model is in the whole suite

689
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,419
between the frequencies around data that

690
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:34,720
a specific point and there is also a

691
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,039
video here so also when one thing that

692
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,419
happens here is that in the data sheet

693
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:43,090
is tasering this point should be and I

694
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:47,049
am attenuating noise right so maybe it

695
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:49,299
would be okay we get a some noise on

696
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:51,820
that point that is Nora Rajini but the

697
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,049
thing is that we are getting extracting

698
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,720
the same signal that we are putting in

699
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,929
the input but at a different frequency

700
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,309
so it's a very weird thing that happens

701
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:08,889
with the sedative and what we have

702
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:10,750
should happen at this frequency that it

703
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,039
would become should be completely

704
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:12,580
blocked

705
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,690
so what individuals how we how did the

706
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,940
output OData see once we reach to the 2g

707
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,330
3G one two five four ten or so we are

708
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,039
getting closer that's okay that's voice

709
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,149
that should be completely fine for for

710
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,740
the system but when we are getting

711
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,019
closer and closer who stands in that we

712
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,629
have we approach the input voltage that

713
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:42,580
we do supply and we are almost there

714
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,159
so we assigned to see exactly the single

715
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:47,080
data that we were under we'll go back to

716
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,210
the to the to the noise again okay this

717
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,559
part is and okay so for this is a

718
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,230
political point of views so how did the

719
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,899
how this would work in a how could we

720
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:06,299
generates I know that I'm much is a DM

721
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,909
but they they they simply which is

722
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,889
working because when okay we were able

723
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,450
to inject a sign on I get something from

724
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,720
the output but it would only work we are

725
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,450
we mind

726
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,680
- too late the ELC the Safety's PLC

727
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,440
systems see exactly what he thinks has

728
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,840
to be in the line because it is for

729
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,000
example she's looking for that Explorer

730
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,830
final and we inject something it's time

731
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,920
web it will fail and the monitoring

732
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,060
system with realize that something is

733
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,820
wrong the line so as an example here

734
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,360
where we are including different types

735
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,250
of of cells and as you can see we are

736
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,660
when I cultivate the senses when we

737
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,900
inject infamous at other q1k kilohertz

738
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,590
and the output is same official but

739
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,440
agency that agree with them with editor

740
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,000
of the microscope we can generate any

741
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,670
types of science so the thing that is

742
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,610
shopping here is a day DC is not

743
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,020
blocking at all designer light should be

744
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,270
blocked and it's actually getting this

745
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,790
angle at it and and multiplying it by 2

746
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,159
because we are in the indie games so

747
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,310
this is a buddha teenagers up here we

748
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,320
kept playing with their signals as you

749
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,550
can see no literally the same because

750
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,429
this sample line there are some minor

751
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:26,900
minor changes on the on the readings so

752
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,330
this is what happen for the 87 706 so

753
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,760
we're starting again what this is going

754
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,590
on here i am why does this happen like

755
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,790
this right so we thought about maybe in

756
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,040
the filter there is some areas where

757
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,830
they are not on western sections or but

758
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,710
Edina today we have no idea what

759
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,909
happened right so that was our first

760
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,400
conclusion we would happen to we kept

761
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,080
thinking and no idea we didn't come up

762
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,480
with any reasoning possible Spanish

763
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,210
until Alexander thinking amicus okay

764
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,130
maybe it's a possible integer or other

765
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,050
form may be disorder speculation right

766
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,720
because we don't we haven't built nav

767
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,570
see ever we we don't know exactly how

768
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,030
this image that things are made from the

769
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,510
VHDL point of view but he's articulating

770
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,090
so Alexander started working on and well

771
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,350
kageura how the filter is implemented in

772
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,810
somewhere you got the code and we study

773
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,380
them working on creating a simulation on

774
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,200
Python

775
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,410
and so and we created a designer so this

776
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,170
is yeah and how effective would work at

777
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,730
this is fine that they put out firing

778
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,800
filter where we will put the design

779
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,140
align and we get noise so there is

780
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,869
nothing there is yeah just like so in

781
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,849
order to prove that or to testify but

782
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,440
would happen if when we put an

783
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,630
integrator overflow on the filter

784
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,540
implementation we digit a Python code

785
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,420
and so we created is a specific Cover

786
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,780
Flow pass so if there some goes over

787
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,970
limit it gets solved flow on K on the

788
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,170
output so our universe we don't know

789
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,430
what is going to happen of this but

790
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,180
interestingly it is morally the same

791
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,430
what we got on the ADC so we have this

792
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,400
very high frequency sine note and on the

793
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,109
output after introducing them take it

794
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:21,660
over the flow on there on the filter

795
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,119
calculations we got the much lower

796
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,859
frequency and final so maybe this is as

797
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,650
a possible explanation data that was

798
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,700
most fun to try

799
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,460
so we also went one step ahead and we do

800
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,109
some the capping of the of the tube

801
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:39,599
thanks to our settle lab to see whether

802
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,940
boo boo boo see that I was a

803
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,550
microprocessor or I couldn't something

804
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,589
like to Balak data or that's alright

805
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,710
or the integrate over flow but from here

806
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,210
and we can see my pan as well this is a

807
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,619
clone generation the vortices and this

808
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,810
is some CMOS logic places in the Ragged

809
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,200
a microprocessor so maybe we were

810
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,349
completely wrong or maybe but you can

811
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,690
also introduce bugs if your permanent

812
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,839
very logical possibly and do some bad

813
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,280
calculations and get some integrable

814
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,319
close but who knows and the next device

815
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,589
is a cottage was entirely with the 87

816
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:22,140
706 or how do we study that I will found

817
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,220
frequencies that someone could hide what

818
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,010
if it's actually doing right so in this

819
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,290
say when using this PLC which is a

820
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,670
natural PLC we don't know but certainly

821
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,550
with which type of VDC because we

822
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,220
created like a it's a top right like the

823
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,980
real a power plant setup where we have

824
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,640
the the PLC at the turbine here that

825
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,029
agenda

826
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,279
reading power for the nuclear plant and

827
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:50,729
he give the control room the control

828
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:53,009
room that is monitoring what is going

829
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:54,769
out there so

830
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:57,989
okay it would have no it would make a

831
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,239
noise I would try to see it and so we're

832
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,239
basically doing this shame and playing

833
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,309
with the frequencies it should be

834
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:06,329
different that they want before but I

835
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:08,309
will show you how it looks like and I'll

836
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:11,579
be by now here we are generating the

837
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,559
semolina in a right way and you don't

838
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,719
see anything weird there the pills is

839
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,909
beauty line and everything everything is

840
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:22,229
fine but in a moment you will start if

841
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:25,380
you see there the motor you will see

842
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,739
that if the starts making weird moves so

843
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,349
that's when we study them to respond to

844
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,809
see that is making we remove that means

845
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:38,640
that we are not driving the motor in the

846
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,650
right way we are inputting wheel

847
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,169
frequencies into the speed so means data

848
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:46,079
what if this is a huge turbine or

849
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,939
efficient motor and you could actually

850
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,739
break it because you are causing lots of

851
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,929
vibrations on them on everything around

852
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,509
it and so along the other component in

853
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,029
another 50 fuses in system a few things

854
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,469
that everything is fine I was applying

855
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:04,019
the continuous 3.6 mm ball right so and

856
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:06,269
this is the code we used to to generate

857
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:10,259
this and basically the way as I said

858
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,029
before the main thing we want to do is

859
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,609
to try to fool the horse of the AVT

860
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,189
right so okay but on food ABC by the

861
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,919
point of view to full be additional

862
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,779
inclusion data see when you're making a

863
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:23,400
team that I've seen things are not there

864
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,079
so we basically here we put a the line

865
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,269
to the right value for a fixed amount of

866
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:33,929
time and after that time we introduce

867
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:37,880
this is fast switching on and off the

868
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,759
we're driving the motor very fast we

869
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:44,130
have frequency so that was the lateral

870
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,019
movement I just saw are actually

871
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,299
produced by that amount right of code

872
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:51,959
and as you can do so from there from the

873
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,449
video the the actual reading so the

874
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:56,729
value is totally fine it doesn't really

875
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:58,700
detects the apps and download

876
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,530
of the sinus or weather-wise it should

877
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,060
be attenuate or indicate that something

878
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,500
is wrong with with the line

879
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,510
so the waveform that we generate is more

880
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,770
like David so why it works so why this

881
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:14,750
it works is because the LED face what is

882
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,230
it

883
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,890
the weighted programmers oh where I also

884
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,810
work two days ago

885
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,750
with this type of system and usually do

886
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,450
is you read a scientist value and I'm

887
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,030
going to start to do accounting right

888
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,880
you are not continually monitoring the

889
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,050
assistant because okay I'm going to

890
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,359
monitor this let's do it once per second

891
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,030
for every two seconds of a lab you

892
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,390
probably read like a during a 100

893
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,880
milliseconds you return two values you

894
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,540
do take the average - to remove some

895
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,820
outliers diagram for some quantification

896
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,619
problems and everything is fine and then

897
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,810
you go to asleep but following this

898
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,640
approach what is happening is that of

899
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,710
course while you are sleeping the system

900
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,050
can become can be changing so that's

901
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,260
actually what I'm having ambition of

902
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,589
this plc it's real design on body this

903
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,230
this type of vision asleep utilize this

904
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,900
so during the sciences where the piece

905
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,510
is actually sitting we can inject angles

906
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,510
very fast line cause we're prevented

907
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,630
like the one position we produced a

908
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,310
design additional example of what we

909
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,099
could use like and on the other bottom

910
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,470
ISM the time that is always actually

911
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,450
reading and leaving the other time is

912
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,460
doing something else it's probably not a

913
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,589
fleeting barrage do the calculations or

914
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:36,470
maybe actually sleepy night I actually

915
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,430
did that quite a few in the past so well

916
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,819
that's also with them with the PC system

917
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:47,690
and we also studied more ATC like way we

918
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,369
have six we studied this one which you

919
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,740
can see it this is the same the same

920
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,329
procedure would be before we study from

921
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:59,180
zero to several mega cards and this

922
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,000
stage is we are using Python and voila

923
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,060
this takes several weeks to two

924
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,280
connections happened editor Christina in

925
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,260
a feminine so it can actually talk like

926
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,349
a monster per per sec -

927
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,690
the whole frequency range so as we can

928
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,829
see here and this is a all these

929
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,450
frequencies you're getting some

930
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,239
unattainable yes I know but is not

931
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,640
enough this is the area where we're

932
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,109
getting the right sign of the inputs I

933
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,640
know that the one that we want to read

934
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,049
but we keep increasing the the frequency

935
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:35,299
which are getting the point where okay

936
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,999
you get annoyed did you find this this

937
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:41,329
area which is where the same input on

938
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,940
the semantics of the of the input but in

939
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,970
this case and this we don't get the same

940
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,910
input finalists will happen with the 87

941
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,989
706 here we get our not right so great

942
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:58,130
honest energy know which we use for an

943
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,380
attacker we have to Street in more

944
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,210
because we have to it depends on how

945
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,489
much it can also download if dozen boys

946
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:07,670
in a more or less statistical values you

947
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,170
can get futures the level may be in some

948
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,029
case it works but it's not like

949
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:12,799
assessing the other one that exactly

950
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,720
replicates your your sign a lot of

951
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,630
different other different frequency well

952
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,329
this is a magnitude a magnified part of

953
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:23,059
the of the beginning and we also study

954
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,630
this other ADC which more or less

955
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,950
performs the same and this is funny

956
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,180
because here this this football scene

957
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,099
similar but this monitors in this area

958
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:36,079
where we have the anagen with equal the

959
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,269
same level of the audience without they

960
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:41,180
or the input even though we play with

961
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,509
different and with different waveforms

962
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:47,029
and we were getting on with the sine

963
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:49,549
wave no matter what input with god we

964
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:52,249
saw with the design work but we couldn't

965
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:52,729
control it

966
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:56,150
so this would work if an the safety

967
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,039
system is respecting exactly that

968
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:00,319
waveform and it is working the same but

969
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,930
preventing to put food and then the

970
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,059
appeal with the will be CDC but it's

971
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,559
more complicated than the first one at

972
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,660
that time we saw and this always someone

973
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,729
does the things right so this is how it

974
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:15,529
should look like when we have trouble

975
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:18,349
implemented intelligent filter and

976
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:21,140
everything that you get the designer at

977
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,700
the beginning which is a magnified view

978
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,330
that we

979
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,760
design along the ranges that you have to

980
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,670
get a sign on but beyond that you don't

981
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,050
get anything else it doesn't matter

982
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,390
which frequencies you'll input so with

983
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,170
this ABC we did we should be fine and

984
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,960
then then we'll statistically decipher

985
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,960
ESP as oc5 which is an a salt which has

986
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,990
a SPD a allows you to buy some logic on

987
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,260
it and it was very fun because we found

988
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,870
this on good data we don't know what it

989
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,650
is so it's just what is done so at some

990
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,050
frequencies so how is it looks like this

991
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,980
for let's say a 50k we're giving these

992
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,920
values 50 case market like it is this

993
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,830
value quickly case us to hit the between

994
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,190
other values it is Sunnah weird and

995
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,660
responds to the end to the frequencies

996
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,120
and of course this part here it's also

997
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,240
prevented in fact because we have no

998
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,340
clue we have to do more more research on

999
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,250
this and we see one one what is going on

1000
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,200
but it's unlikely education again all

1001
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,790
day all day beginning so this is the

1002
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,790
we're looking what would you get and the

1003
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:35,780
distant male summary table of how we see

1004
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,090
a complicated or impossibility to fully

1005
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:43,490
assist in using visa vie seduces and as

1006
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,180
a final thought and the recommendation 0

1007
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,760
which is always like validate your input

1008
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,580
the same way we do with with their web

1009
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,100
browsers with the mobile apps anything

1010
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,060
together an input from the outside

1011
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,760
should be validated it is very the same

1012
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,800
thing so the only things that are we

1013
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,590
problem there is no much attention on

1014
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,710
the pure electrical part of the other

1015
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:11,390
systems so even though some data if you

1016
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,580
really recommend using intelligent

1017
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,860
filters sometimes they are too too

1018
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,040
relaxed that I allow you to put like 50k

1019
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,890
bandwidth so if you are using the system

1020
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,510
with the narrow between

1021
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,910
try to put a null geology filter for

1022
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,960
that part and well that is so any

1023
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,360
question or or anything

1024
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,790
[Applause]

1025
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,329
so you mentioned that it could be this

1026
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,760
integer overflow so you seem to think

1027
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,140
that is a digital problem in fact or is

1028
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,300
it an electrical problem parasite

1029
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:20,339
currents or interference or it is a

1030
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:23,400
digital problem that casa da facility

1031
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,750
they think because at the end of the day

1032
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,760
most of the systems some of them have

1033
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,859
been make your process or inside that

1034
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:31,430
drives the whole reading the whole

1035
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,690
outputting because they have to also

1036
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,890
convert to SBI and I as we know we have

1037
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,540
so where you can update you can fixed

1038
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,190
you can do everything instead of

1039
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,970
changing the whole day whole thing with

1040
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,010
a BST air which is more more complicated

1041
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,559
and effective but in fact yes if it's

1042
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,720
actually taking over flow which could be

1043
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,670
I don't know if someone has more

1044
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,530
experience with that we are really happy

1045
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:01,640
to hear that is a total inter digitizing

1046
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,680
how much does this behavior do you think

1047
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,770
is down to anomalies or weaknesses and

1048
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,990
how much dance just normal behavior or

1049
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,720
said transformative life so I didn't get

1050
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,200
there with them

1051
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,350
how much behaviour is this may be

1052
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,710
anomalous or due to weaknesses in

1053
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,270
implementation like an overflow or how

1054
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,500
much do you think it's just standard

1055
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,180
normal characteristics or taking

1056
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,410
something into the dead transform

1057
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,880
analysis and the thing is if even in the

1058
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,850
87 706 if you do the proper areas and

1059
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,030
pls in filter the attacks would be to be

1060
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,590
stopped it's like a we are do you put

1061
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,380
the database if you disable it okay but

1062
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,060
if you just use it wrong you're going to

1063
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,490
get SQL injections right so it's more

1064
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,110
about the same day this is what it is

1065
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,540
and maybe that's the feature that can be

1066
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,160
changed but if you properly

1067
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,690
narrow the bandwidth that you are using

1068
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,970
you won't be getting this province this

1069
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,160
one arises because for the Delta G my

1070
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,560
this is the the marketing point is like

1071
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,710
you don't need as a strict cancellation

1072
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,990
filter because it's over something so

1073
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,120
it's not something either ten times of

1074
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,240
20 times the frequency they are reading

1075
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,680
people need not my stat lab we've shown

1076
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,890
that I see if you go above the limit

1077
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,900
even below the anti-aliasing filter

1078
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,990
start cutting of the frequencies they

1079
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,490
can be they can be problems and I mean

1080
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,710
and that's one thing one of the

1081
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,330
questions you ask and the other one is a

1082
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,120
weather data a program of the of ABC I

1083
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,510
think if the same data six sources data

1084
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,820
that other game to the frequency we are

1085
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,470
using should be blocked with an

1086
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,240
implementation issues was there or they

1087
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,950
or they or the data it is wrong so

1088
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,720
something is missing their other data

1089
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,240
seed is not properly written I could be

1090
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,870
also with or and they are doing wrong in

1091
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,930
the whatever thing they are doing many

1092
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,720
because also my don't I don't know this

1093
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,840
is a speculation but they don't expect

1094
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,660
anyone trying to do these type of things

1095
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,700
like it's like from the early days the

1096
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,160
one did anything that anything on the

1097
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,970
sole where

1098
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,619
no one validated anything you just get

1099
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,770
everything on the IOPS of the kernel you

1100
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,900
assume that the point that you were

1101
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,910
getting where kernel space but what

1102
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,550
happens if you're using user space

1103
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,260
pointer like more or less the same and

1104
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,230
things are there they could be broken so

1105
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,390
you have to validate whatever goes in

1106
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,490
that I make sure that it matches where

1107
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:53,200
what it has to have to be thank you

1108
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,489
[Applause]
