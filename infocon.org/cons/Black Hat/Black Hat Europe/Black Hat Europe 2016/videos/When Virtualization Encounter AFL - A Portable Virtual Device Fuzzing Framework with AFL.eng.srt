1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,290
hello and we're glad to take the

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,319
conference of a black hat and my topic

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,200
could about what realizations of the bar

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,920
fighting integrated with the AFL a car

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,160
American fasting group reaches ephemeris

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,720
and fighting framework currently under D

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,210
think it is my agenda first I will

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,470
introduce a little of us and also I will

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,630
introduce how we think and how we

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,890
consider it our funding approach and

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,260
also I will introduce the implementation

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,160
of our solution in detail and last I

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,640
will try to I will try to introduce case

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,129
study of how we use our fighting

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,770
framework to reproduce the vulnerability

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,870
of venom okay this is my partner Jack

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,309
the tech highest work the 10 plus years

18
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,250
in security include micro focusing on

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,619
broader document and convertibility but

20
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,590
his legs are badly hurt so it could not

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,900
travel with me that the bad wishes to

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,580
Jack and it is me I have worked about

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,509
the cell years in security in fin micro

24
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,310
manipulating on the sandbox development

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,090
and on currently deployed of Windows

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,090
Mike Android and iOS and so forth first

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,240
of all the summarizer of the funding

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,890
approaches to also brutalization

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,549
software the first category I can't

30
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,000
quite fast in the ghetto ass the key

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
point I decide to researcher of the

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,159
further with trying to capture as the

33
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,850
normal old request in the ghetto or get

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,990
VM and try to replace the request in the

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,630
Gaslamp was the target were two devices

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,619
and the during the fighting process the

37
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,830
researcher will faster the data and

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,750
costs brutalize agents of the world to

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,270
cry

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,940
so the advantages about it can devil

41
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,580
approach is that it is simple it is

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,250
simple and it is odd cause abnormal

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,480
knowledge of our protocol knowledge but

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,300
as a Peter the quantity Satan there is

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,690
no code courage and the by design the

46
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,260
Fighting's group is in containment on

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,140
that conference another category of four

48
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,720
methods is the conformance fighting test

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,900
which is suggested in black height

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,150
before black black head conference

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,490
perform so keep on day you tighten it

52
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,790
kind of method we will try to trace the

53
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,000
Creed entities of a register and owl

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,630
memory using the symbolic execution so

55
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,930
so advantage of also for this kind of

56
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,530
method it is it can fast deeper but

57
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,960
these are the one to decide size also

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,130
like over code courage and the

59
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,830
performance would be relatively low in

60
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,400
academic so third party is a code

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,740
courage the code courage articles the

62
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,550
researcher to revealing a lot of open

63
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,460
source code or console reversing the

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,030
binary code as assembly code so it would

65
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,290
cause lot effort for the researcher but

66
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,630
this kind of method could not be as

67
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,400
available even also it this way is the

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,860
flexible so sorry this is my much money

69
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,520
attacking interfaces towards the virtual

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,710
utilizations of the world and our

71
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,350
solution is focusing on so what we

72
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,380
divide this part here and here

73
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,340
so as our approach we have designed

74
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,500
according to four principles in our

75
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,350
design so first principle is about the

76
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,730
probability as actually we have used

77
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,460
catamite bells open-source system as the

78
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,580
common format of a wordy disk and

79
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,310
secondly we have uses a serial port

80
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,950
devices as the community communication

81
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,130
bridge between between the VM another

82
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,400
under the host the Tecna period is a

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,730
performance because we have introduced

84
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,590
the bells actually the bells system is

85
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,400
much lighter than the guest that we am

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,110
set has the Linux windows and so forth

87
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,680
so the performance of fading could could

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,790
be high the third principle is that the

89
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,270
fighting could be direct because our

90
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,490
funding framework is inert about situm

91
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,540
which can direct access were to devices

92
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,870
so there's no interference of the device

93
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,500
and lower layer of gas ram so supporting

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,320
could be directed to the worst devices

95
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,729
and finally our solution have introduced

96
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,580
have introduces code courage and

97
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,820
feedback and control integrated with AFL

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,030
okay let's see the architecture and

99
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,960
overview module by module actually so

100
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,390
for architecture is divided into four or

101
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,330
four important modules the left part is

102
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,790
the virtualization software process

103
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,240
occur we as he it contains the catamites

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,620
bowel Sitton required to CBS and also

105
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,510
the memory and i/o space

106
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,350
operation proxy server we are required

107
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,080
to MLPs so we entity contains several

108
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,240
virtual devices such as

109
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,229
network seeker and so forth and the

110
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,520
virtual server to the report is here and

111
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,229
are not important

112
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,479
a model is the device control client

113
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,240
module it can communicate with the proxy

114
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,449
server where the word to see robot here

115
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,419
and the device control data it's

116
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,139
formatted which is suitable for FL

117
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,229
folding under the AFL relating the

118
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,979
module is outside of the VM which is

119
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,560
located on the host side here okay

120
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,380
this is the user interface if

121
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,710
during our fighting activity so it'll

122
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,500
ever all fasten your user interface

123
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,820
let's is the CBS cut my bowels system

124
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,539
module in detail actually this power

125
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,120
system is based on the sibyl's

126
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,620
open-source product and we have designed

127
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,240
our practice server inside the CBS and

128
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,479
we have also uses or what would would

129
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,729
use your report as the communication

130
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:31,229
bridge traditionally any versus edom

131
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,260
have three feet have three phases in the

132
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,620
whole lifecycle the first surface is the

133
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,889
power-on self-test and the second is the

134
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,550
put face put into the castle of an

135
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,150
operating system the second the third

136
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,180
one is it will provide the basic input

137
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,509
and about included and the output browse

138
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,550
situm service for the random cat vamp

139
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,930
actually in our fighting promote we we

140
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,570
should remove unnecessary put this and

141
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,000
the bells Wrentham servic service and it

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,690
does keep the positives in our design

143
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,919
and in the post service we have we'll

144
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,439
add our act recording for example

145
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,749
after the up - up to the political

146
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,479
detection of the vehicle memory and the

147
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,159
settable of hardware and the review at

148
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,919
our necessary device hardware setup for

149
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,649
example server to serial pot and finally

150
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,009
we will run up our Prouty server module

151
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:48,160
in a Honda loop okay about the proxy

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,439
server its main trouble it is either it

153
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,350
view receives the memory IO access

154
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,100
requests from outside of the guest VM

155
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,750
and executed the request inside the

156
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,970
protesser module until the whole process

157
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,040
crash actually we have were doing some

158
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,470
modification to us interruption

159
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,990
mechanism in Cecilia's catamites file

160
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,829
system and we replace the interruption

161
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:25,600
mechanism with support mechanism towards

162
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,389
the targeting were two devices and with

163
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:33,189
with tomate mechanism so the mint

164
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,730
robbery of the proxy server is it view

165
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,470
receives our requests which could be

166
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,670
described like this for example is the

167
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,850
input input bite into the world into the

168
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,220
lung or to the bind of output the word

169
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,550
order for the long and read write

170
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,130
specific address with oh sorry we see

171
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,410
Pacific value and lips so the Proteus

172
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,050
server can process so I'm our requests

173
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,850
like this another important module you

174
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,819
know design is the device control client

175
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,610
the device control client will handle or

176
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,279
read in the device control data which is

177
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,660
a formatted suitable for FL fuzzy and I

178
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,230
will describe a third DCD DCD format

179
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,610
later so the main problem of the DCT

180
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,310
could be divided into

181
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,750
the four steps so first step is to the

182
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,700
DCCC we will and launch so module

183
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,430
modulation with utilization subdue our

184
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,640
process and also as to notice so cut my

185
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,990
pal situm like this understand so how do

186
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,089
you think we will say hello to the proxy

187
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,339
server inside of the CCDs and this under

188
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,910
certain e so DCC will send us the

189
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,600
initialization requests to the CPS for

190
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
example it will send the generalization

191
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,960
request towards so USB it's a 2 CI

192
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,910
devices and like this and finally the

193
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,480
DCC will pass the GCD data or scientist

194
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,940
or other side of the cell well p.m. and

195
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,830
the translators the PCs GCD to our

196
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,430
request

197
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,970
ok last is a workflow step by step at

198
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,310
the first that we will first incremented

199
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,130
to target devices of civilizations of

200
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,800
the world for example the target is the

201
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,710
USB related software what we do at this

202
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,760
and effect is that we will use FL fast

203
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,270
to launch the targeted device a target

204
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,839
application occur device control client

205
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,440
GCC understand the DCC will read in so

206
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,180
formatted device control data and the

207
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,480
communicate which is a practice server

208
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,600
where the virtual serial port under then

209
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,290
the protein server will be will receive

210
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,780
the request and the eCos liquid so

211
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,600
required inside the utilization software

212
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,070
process and finally the FL first we will

213
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,860
calculate the code coverage and mutate

214
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,260
the device control data for further

215
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,390
solving in a whole loop

216
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,880
okay let's see the step 1 actually it is

217
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,690
disabled you to set how the

218
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,240
instrumentation towards the target what

219
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,680
we do at is for the open source what we

220
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,290
devices such as

221
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,910
qemu we will use PFL GCC to instrument

222
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,029
the target device ISM as a compelling

223
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,079
and controlled hem and for the with

224
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,450
realization devices which are not open

225
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,769
source for example when where rotation

226
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:20,680
and so forth we will try to instrument

227
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,579
the exact self statically or we all we

228
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,860
will patch the binary code within the

229
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:36,310
restricted range so this it is that one

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,000
in the whole program in the whole graph

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,120
and as the step two we will set up a

232
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,930
trees and the feedback using pfl

233
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,269
actually we will use AFL first to launch

234
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,130
our DCC application with a specific

235
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,269
parameter for example team is Tam for a

236
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,890
second for a second fighting it means

237
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,490
the 90 seconds and M means memory

238
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,949
reserved the memory for so

239
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:12,519
virtualization we am and as I means

240
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,339
input the input a folder which contains

241
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,930
d CD data and the all means is output

242
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,019
data which contain so the generated the

243
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,990
crash crash along quite well so FL first

244
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,430
we automatically mutate is a PCB data

245
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,339
and calculated so called courage in the

246
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,240
whole loop though this is a tableau to

247
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,920
in the whole picture unless asserted

248
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,250
such that it to encoding the d CD and

249
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,319
the read in actually as we know the SL

250
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:56,700
has has integrated several beauty

251
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,470
strategy in yourself for example better

252
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,130
sleep

253
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,250
Peter flip delete delete' in some crater

254
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,730
of the into the cell and binding the

255
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,520
some products interval and so forth so

256
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,990
we must encoding of a match so our

257
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,370
request to submit to specific format so

258
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,360
as to suit so as to be suitable for so

259
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,650
ever AFL fatty for example take the USB

260
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,740
related devices command entry for

261
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,870
example here we can including so

262
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,020
commander ID as the first fault but in

263
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,860
our DVD and the story this is an input

264
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,600
buffer here sorry

265
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,170
following is the input buffer here in

266
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,240
this rectangle and also is another atom

267
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,970
of commander ID in the green rectangle

268
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,240
and followed with the input buffer here

269
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,550
in the red rectangle okay today this

270
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:16,320
laboratory in the whole picture so so

271
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,710
first so first able to control the

272
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:25,050
divided communication actually the CBI's

273
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,260
module will start have a first

274
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,600
integrated cower and initialize the

275
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,740
utilization devices under start the

276
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,630
protein server inside it and the

277
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,880
producer will we will start to

278
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,100
neutralize the target devices for

279
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,220
example the USB HCI

280
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,180
related devices

281
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,200
and the pendulum so this is the DCD

282
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,440
module at outer side episode we am will

283
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,820
read insert DVD data and equipped and

284
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,250
communicated where's the virtual plot to

285
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,490
the proxy server inside of the CBS so

286
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,750
the proxy server we will receive the

287
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,939
request and it is secreted so request

288
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,869
inside the 30s until so whole worthless

289
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,500
agents offer to our crash okay today

290
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,530
this type of fall in the whole graph

291
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,650
okay let's see the work workflow in will

292
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:38,030
go F L the first diver is to so first

293
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,549
tablet to use AFL instrumented use AFL

294
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,830
to instrument eight what we devices in

295
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,200
inside of virtual software process and

296
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,320
the second FL first we will launch the

297
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,740
DCC identity will read in the DTD and

298
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,169
the under the DCC will the

299
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,970
utilization software process and a bit

300
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,740
fall so where he process if the word

301
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,799
peoples are the crashes so so crash

302
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,820
information could be notified to the DCC

303
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,390
because so our sitting call with for PID

304
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,030
will written and if the DCC receives

305
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:30,710
crash information it it will crash

306
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,380
itself the crash information would be

307
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,740
notifying it to FL so AFL fasten would

308
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,840
catch with the gaseous crasher

309
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,590
information of the DCCC and calculated

310
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,730
the code courage of the recipe process

311
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,600
and the mutated DVD data and ricotta so

312
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,610
crash over the wealthy actually sir ago

313
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,250
see some several important tips in our

314
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,280
practice and you concurrence of activity

315
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,810
faulting

316
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,990
one very important tip is about this

317
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,360
instrumentation because Sara it is much

318
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,540
were two devices and we only care about

319
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,570
several part of the water events for

320
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,090
example we just care even without care

321
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,390
about the USB part we could model

322
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,120
modifying the mix well and like this for

323
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,400
example for our resort code we only care

324
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,190
about the HC d x8 CI a-- dot o related

325
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,210
assault coded sold well if we find that

326
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,370
it kind of thought fell we will use the

327
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,970
FL GCC to compel did cannot sell or

328
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,480
within within instrumentation otherwise

329
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,150
we will so traditional traditional CC to

330
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,860
compare the sub code but for the witchy

331
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,310
devices which is which is not open

332
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,000
source we can try to instrument so it

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,280
exactly fell for example for voted for

334
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,430
win revocation we can try to add this

335
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,630
neutralization and a trampoline segment

336
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,200
at the tool over the exact excel and the

337
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,810
false attack is the code we will catch

338
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,820
the binary code like this trembling

339
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,460
trembling function first we receive so

340
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,820
important registers and then we will

341
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,940
call our FL may be log related the treat

342
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,980
treating well treating function and

343
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,810
upset with wrist also important

344
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,220
registers and then we will fix our entry

345
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,490
point of the exact well to point to the

346
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,450
Midland realization code another

347
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,510
important tip is about a multi protest

348
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,200
fuzzing in because as with the ffs we

349
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,150
were launched search for the long-term

350
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,690
process GCC the launch of cilantro that

351
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,220
will last two launches or targeted

352
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
protests

353
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,280
the TCC is not instrumented in our

354
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,750
design under the West P is it is is

355
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:25,340
implemented with the FL as we know me

356
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,630
the trees info of the FL is shared

357
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,840
across different different processes in

358
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,960
nature so so treating imple is naturally

359
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,690
supporting multi-process so we have to

360
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,900
do is start to the first one is we have

361
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,419
to remove the instrumentation tech NFL

362
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,080
because the DCC has no I don't know any

363
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,880
instrumentation under the other side we

364
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,679
have to deliver to quite simple from the

365
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,620
target process to launcher process for

366
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,270
example we can use the fork and the with

367
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,419
for PID method and also we will check

368
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,610
out the connection of the zero pot to

369
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:14,960
check the crash of circuit process as

370
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,559
pseudocode of the GCC first interview

371
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,950
for child process in the childhood i

372
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,429
think it will launch so over the legend

373
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,850
software process and and in the in the

374
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,059
parent process it will wit fall so we as

375
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:38,850
he and if so when he prasad crashes so

376
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,970
we will get a special signal of signal

377
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,590
then so DC t will crash itself inside

378
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,730
the so in inside is a protest group okay

379
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,500
let's is real case study actually we

380
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,289
have used our fighting polemical to

381
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,720
faster floppy disk controller devices

382
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,750
and we have reproduced the venom

383
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:10,580
vulnerability at first we will try to

384
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,090
instrument a part of the virtual devices

385
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,140
and we care about the floppy disk

386
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,210
control dot objective

387
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,509
using the FL GCC leaving the other

388
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:29,019
resultcode living to the shortcode

389
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:32,289
compounded by CC an exactly the way we

390
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,960
will design our input input case sell

391
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,539
our akka TC deal agnese it is simple

392
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,519
first either it contains the command ID

393
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,950
the arguments count arguments list and

394
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,019
to keep the fighting it more effective

395
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,409
we will try to integrate the several

396
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,289
different command line come on a

397
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:59,470
controller command in our case for

398
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,759
example it will contains the floppy disk

399
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,490
array the floppy disk right and a flood

400
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,460
flood bigger seek and also we will try

401
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,039
to passing our GCC to DCT we will pass

402
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,450
so input file and it it to so i'm our

403
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,509
requests for example it means output the

404
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,399
support three five three f5 with the

405
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,029
value a te with special value and so

406
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,590
forth and finally we will use FF us to

407
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,860
launch our device control client ok

408
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:49,659
let's see the video demo this is a bash

409
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:54,119
bash file to launch the GCC first video

410
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,230
first with you three we will make two

411
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,580
pipeline pipelines the two pipelines are

412
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,059
for communication were the serial port

413
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:10,419
understand we will use the power suit

414
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,990
parameter this it means the cat my cat

415
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,549
amended BIOS system dot bin with the

416
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,690
third line we have made made before and

417
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,879
then we view uses o FF us to launch the

418
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:31,960
GCC a car test program

419
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,900
also we have were designed as a time for

420
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,890
fighting cycle with network with with

421
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,180
the priestess nine nine nine thousand

422
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,920
seconds and with the murmur of the 2048

423
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,150
megabyte okay we can see details about

424
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,410
the CB s titties the GCC titties the pep

425
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,530
lines for posting report and this is our

426
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,290
batch file okay we will launch our batch

427
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:10,160
file you can see so FL fast will launch

428
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:17,990
our also oh you can see the two two

429
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,160
queries new IDs favorite pass and

430
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,320
conquer it on a map identity and so

431
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,260
forth it is also floppy disk controller

432
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,760
okay let's see second video in this

433
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,100
video we have we have generated the two

434
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,680
crashes and one is unique and we will

435
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,820
try to reproduce the crash using the

436
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,840
crash file first review leaves the the

437
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,830
crash fails here did values generated by

438
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,890
FF us automatically and we will try to

439
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:09,910
run our DCC breezes or crash Val

440
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,380
output folder crash folder specific

441
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,159
Excel and also we will get this at a

442
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,890
Content spot of the utilizations of the

443
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:31,789
where akka qemu okay this is my lad page

444
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:36,100
of my cutie thank you very much

445
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,349
[Applause]
