1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
all right everyone thank you for joining

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,560
me today my talk is called war world

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,560
post quantum cryptography I'm Jennifer

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,780
phrenic on Twitter I'm engineer if you

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,240
want to tweet a bit about me is I'm a

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,070
researcher at the Institute for quantum

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,720
computing and the Center for Applied

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,910
cryptographic research at the faculty of

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,949
mathematics at the University of

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,890
Waterloo in Canada I can be contacted at

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,439
the places listed the project that I'll

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,449
speak about toward the end of my talk

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,360
involves a number of collaborators many

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,670
of whom are located at the Institute for

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,989
quantum computing at the University of

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,510
Waterloo but our network of contributors

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,280
definitely extends beyond that and I

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,050
encourage you to read into this for

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,430
further details I think my work has a

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,070
lot of opinions in it so I'd like you to

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,840
note that

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,430
well I'm presenting projects that are

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,230
definitely collaborations and work with

24
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,350
others the opinions are entirely my own

25
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,850
also I would ask you to know that there

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,620
are a lot of recent changes and moving

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,750
parts in this project so to forgive any

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,100
omissions my work is funded by a

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,140
Canadian research body known as crypto

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,790
works 21 and I should acknowledge that

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,080
as well finally I guess I am working

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,530
within some constraints today so like

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,040
any good engineer I will try to work

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,650
well within them and get as close to the

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,240
message that I was originally aiming for

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,340
as possible so let's begin what would it

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,540
mean if all of our public key

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,409
cryptography were broken or perhaps to

39
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,060
be a bit more imaginative what would it

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,710
mean if all of our cryptography in the

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,079
world were suddenly broken this would

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,799
mean that we could no longer

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,290
authenticate users we could no longer

44
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,439
keep private information confidential it

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,000
would mean that everyone can kind of be

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,970
everyone else all of the time we can

47
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,619
imagine that social activities would

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,350
cease online we could imagine that the

49
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,750
global financial system with large they

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,460
come to a grinding halt unable to

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,399
process large value transactions cards

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,098
payments transfers they would even be

53
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,810
difficult in some cases to get cash if

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,650
we were unable to update our a BMPs

55
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,989
we can imagine that ecommerce would stop

56
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,879
in all the Leafs in which it exists

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,739
including a halt to the global supply

58
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,200
chain due to a lack of secure

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,780
communications and payments we would

60
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,700
imagine that all of the emerging events

61
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,110
in the world get what results of this

62
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,540
chaos would need to be reported on to

63
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,920
maintain a good democracy through

64
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,209
journalists who would no longer have

65
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,790
access to secure communications and we

66
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,250
can imagine that large corporations as

67
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,790
well as NGOs would be unable to

68
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,359
communicate secure information with only

69
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,700
their intended parties and this will

70
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,799
lead to an uncovering of legally and

71
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,409
economically relevant data we can

72
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,840
imagine perhaps even more extensively

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,120
that the global geopolitical scheme of

74
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,299
things we dramatically shift with

75
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:00,980
everything suddenly needing to become

76
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,139
either silenced or entirely public

77
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,599
information many things would be

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,879
revealed in a very short time and many

79
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,620
things would be revealed by the absence

80
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,290
of activities we can imagine up an optic

81
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,150
on where many of us would have to

82
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,560
self-censor the way that we believe

83
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,329
because often participating in a

84
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,760
democracy requires privacy which in

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,940
these days is enabled by our technology

86
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,560
we would want to update our systems as

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,299
soon as we could so we could go back to

88
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,250
the regular days of using cryptography

89
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,049
and security to preserve our actions on

90
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,930
the internet but alas if we didn't have

91
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,180
digital signatures we would have no way

92
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,069
of secure code signing and secure

93
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,040
software distribution so let's think

94
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,810
about this imaginary world where we

95
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,180
didn't have our secure cryptography that

96
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,370
we have today and how does this thought

97
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,930
change if we know that it will happen

98
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,470
but we do not know when so I'll be

99
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,810
speaking today about quantum computers

100
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,120
and cryptography this has been widely

101
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,799
spoken about in the media in the last

102
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,040
year or so August 2015 we've got an

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,810
announcement from the American National

104
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,659
Security Agency stating that the NIST

105
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,940
suite be a cryptographic algorithms

106
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,040
would be updated to include quantum safe

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,370
ciphers and this is because cryptography

108
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,290
is based on the mathematical hardness of

109
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,180
certain problems that prevents the

110
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,988
recovery of public of private keys and

111
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,000
historically quantum historically these

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,070
problems that we use right now so chose

113
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,950
good problems

114
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,230
like RSA or elliptic curves have been

115
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,960
considered intractable in polynomial

116
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
time they have not been considered

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,380
efficiently solvable but quantum

118
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,750
computers are missing the power of

119
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,250
quantum mechanics and the types of

120
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,230
algorithms we can build can change this

121
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,600
for us so problems that were once very

122
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,930
hard becomes very easy a few examples of

123
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,520
problems where quantum computers have

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,800
known algorithmic speed ups include the

125
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,420
factoring of large numbers into their

126
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,730
component primes it includes discrete

127
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,040
logarithm computations it includes the

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,050
search of large unstructured databases

129
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,360
and it can it can include many other

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,090
algorithms that are yet emerging now the

131
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,160
three that I've listed here are what

132
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,910
underlies RSA elliptic curves and a

133
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,860
brute-force attack on all of our

134
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,960
symmetric key cryptography so the

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,670
consequence we can become very nervous

136
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,770
and we can start to imagine that initial

137
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,380
thought experiment or suddenly all of

138
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,420
our cryptography is quite endangered and

139
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:29,880
what do we do about this everything that

140
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,950
has ever been a will ever be sent over

141
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,840
the internet using a quantum vulnerable

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,370
algorithm could be subject to leap

143
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,890
adversarial decryption when shall Hart

144
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,960
once in large-scale quantum computer

145
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,990
becomes available now the problem is we

146
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,550
assume that this will be like the iPhone

147
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,440
7 announcement that it'll be all over

148
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
the news and everyone will be taking

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,740
pictures and queuing up to see a quantum

150
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,290
computer but that's very unlikely so we

151
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,730
don't actually know when this could be

152
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,200
and we don't know who will develop it

153
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,630
first who might be motivated to build

154
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,000
such a thing we should ask ourselves

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
quantum computers have many uses

156
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,360
including metrology quantum simulations

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,330
material science possibly machine

158
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,490
learning but also they have use encrypt

159
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,740
analysis so we need to be open to the

160
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,300
idea that the availability of such a

161
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,580
machine may not necessarily be publicly

162
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,680
announced it may not necessarily be

163
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,720
within our borders or the borders of

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
countries that are friendly with us we

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,830
need to keep in mind that it could be in

166
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,690
a research university or outside of a

167
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,460
research university perhaps in private

168
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,980
sector or in the government and people

169
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,210
are often asking about what these

170
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,970
timelines are so I can provide you with

171
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,800
many references toward the end but we're

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,350
hearing things like a complete a one in

173
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,660
seven chance of a complete break of RSA

174
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,230
20:48 by 2026 a 50% chance of such a

175
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,650
thing by 2031 we're hearing about the

176
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,530
having a large-scale quantum computer or

177
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,380
at least having a scalable qubit in the

178
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,540
next five years so many of the estimates

179
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,010
that I'm hearing from relatively

180
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,930
somewhat conservative and well grounded

181
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,120
in quantum computation researchers on

182
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,010
the order of 5 to 15 years this is very

183
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,110
soon if we consider how long it took us

184
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,970
for example to move from DES to triple

185
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,260
this so my favorite slide of all this is

186
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,480
how we would break the internet with a

187
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,070
single circuit and maybe that's a bit

188
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,290
dramatic but it's also a bit true so

189
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,840
this is the quantum circuit for Shor's

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,770
algorithm that is used to factor large

191
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,570
numbers into component primes in

192
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,640
polynomial time which would result in

193
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,950
the complete recovery of private G's of

194
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,830
RSA of an arbitrarily large modulus if

195
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,590
we think about quantum proofing the

196
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,380
internet we often talk about the

197
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,260
cryptography itself but in fact there's

198
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,700
much more to it that's most of what I'm

199
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,960
here to talk about today because I think

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,390
it's been largely ignored so crypto

201
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,800
systems are the basis of what we're

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,870
talking about crypto systems that have

203
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,550
been built on the presume difficulty of

204
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,990
discrete algorithm or integer

205
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,240
factorization our vulnerable to quantum

206
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,250
attacks so we need to upgrade them but

207
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,390
the problem is they're not simply

208
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,340
something that we can drop into existing

209
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,070
protocols any protocols that rely on the

210
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,020
difficulty of these crypto systems are

211
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,270
then vulnerable to quantum attacks until

212
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,370
we're able to upgrade them and then

213
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,930
beyond that when we think about products

214
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,610
be they vendor products be they open

215
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,740
source products when they're deriving

216
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,690
their security from these protocols and

217
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,680
crypto systems which is largely the case

218
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,710
they also become vulnerable so you know

219
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,039
in academia within standards bodies a

220
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,020
bit within industry as well people

221
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,120
started to make efforts toward quantum

222
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,929
safe security

223
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,510
these kind of come in four quadrants so

224
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,280
what is Cryptologic research that's the

225
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,260
hard core stuff that's most of what

226
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,960
myself and my colleagues do this is

227
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,490
development of new quantum safe

228
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,950
algorithms this is using quantum crypt

229
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,900
analytic methods to attack the proposed

230
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,910
quantum safe

231
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,860
rhythms because right now to be honest a

232
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,630
lot of people say something's quantum

233
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,040
safe if it resists the two algorithms

234
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,020
I've already told you about and not

235
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,790
considered that there's potentially an

236
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,830
infinite number of other quantum

237
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,540
algorithms that could attack these same

238
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,270
ciphers it also involves the classical

239
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,130
cryptanalysis of these proposed quantum

240
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,050
safe crypto systems because just because

241
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,210
it's resistant to these quantum

242
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,160
algorithms shores and Grover's algorithm

243
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,990
doesn't mean that we won't find a very

244
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,760
nice classical algorithm that can break

245
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,500
them so there's a lot of very important

246
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,230
illogical research that needs to occur

247
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,280
beyond this and this is the border of

248
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
some of my work as well as systems and

249
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,180
integration so most post quantum

250
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,710
algorithms are not simply a drop-in

251
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,420
replacement for our status quo

252
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,510
asymmetric algorithms a careful study of

253
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,280
the integration of these protocols is

254
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,140
required because in a lot of cases

255
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,210
they'll require substantial retooling to

256
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,090
even work and the specifications for

257
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,220
these protocols can often be studied and

258
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,960
we find something like you know you read

259
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,080
this standard for TLS and we can fit

260
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,940
many arbitrary quantum safe algorithms

261
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,380
into them but if you look at the de

262
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,570
facto standard open SSL it doesn't

263
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,400
support the key sizes we thought so

264
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,660
there's a lot of differentials between

265
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,100
what is written there what happens in

266
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,200
practice there's also work within

267
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,810
standardization bodies there's many of

268
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,940
these there's the dominant work is

269
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,800
within the national institutions and

270
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,170
technology in the United States they're

271
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,540
hosting a competition for post quantum

272
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,250
algorithms but there's also work within

273
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,980
bodies like IETF and Etsy they're

274
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,050
looking to standardize algorithms cipher

275
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,210
suites and the upgrades required for

276
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,760
existing protocols to beat quantum safe

277
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,350
there's many players in the space and

278
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,820
it's growing all the time and I look at

279
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,740
it with some skepticism I think then

280
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,450
this competition is a very core thing

281
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,580
that we need to consider because we need

282
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,990
to figure out what these new algorithms

283
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,610
will be and what will replace suite B

284
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,980
but sometimes I look at various

285
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,630
standards bodies and I wonder what is

286
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,190
their relevant what are their objectives

287
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,740
who are their key players vendor and

288
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,330
open source software products are kind

289
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,950
of the end stage of what we want to do

290
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,960
so open source software helps us study

291
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,330
integration and deploy quantum safe

292
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,550
software to a global system the

293
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,170
availability of vendor products lets us

294
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,000
actually use these quantum resistance

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,890
standards but this is really difficult

296
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,760
because we don't know what these

297
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
standards will be there are so many

298
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,090
different quantum assists and algorithms

299
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,540
under consideration right now

300
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,410
that to start to deploy them in industry

301
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,960
or across the internet without mind to

302
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,370
the fact that they could change or that

303
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,870
they could be broken the next years

304
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,720
would be naive nevertheless this

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,550
research is important we start to see it

306
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,490
in the wild and this is very important

307
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,750
examples are we seeing quantum resistant

308
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,600
versions of TLS released we've seen a

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,640
quantum resistant circuit extension

310
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,610
handshake for tor by a colleague of mine

311
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,080
this work was particularly interesting

312
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,760
because it was a hybrid mode that

313
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,740
combined a quantum resistant cipher and

314
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,560
a classical cipher and what this means

315
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,870
is that in the worst case even if the

316
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,400
quantum resistance cipher were to be

317
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,530
broken the classical cipher we would

318
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,300
still have the level of security that it

319
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,810
guarantees so hybrid options are very

320
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,310
useful particularly in this early stage

321
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,810
where we're not sure what's going to win

322
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,560
out for the future replacement of RSA we

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
see quantum C's cash based digital

324
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,620
signatures and other kinds of digital

325
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,870
signatures going through the IETF and

326
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,670
there's other works in progress now

327
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,100
because I've been asked to retool my

328
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,590
talk for today I have included some

329
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,540
surprise research for you to fill that

330
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,840
void and we'll eventually get to the

331
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,270
proposed software project but first

332
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,950
let's talk about a use case of quantum

333
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,320
resistance off-the-record messaging so

334
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,930
some of you may be familiar with OTR

335
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,870
this is the work of Borissov Goldberg

336
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,900
and Breuer in 2004

337
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,370
what I'm going to talk you through right

338
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,990
now very quickly is a case study in

339
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,340
quantum resistant off-the-record

340
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,290
messaging by myself and my colleague

341
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,440
Robin Mishra after good messaging is

342
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,090
really cool for privacy minded people

343
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,460
this is an incredibly important protocol

344
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,530
and basically it was the idea that we

345
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,060
wanted people to be able to talk off the

346
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,220
record on the internet so a lot of the

347
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,990
security and privacy properties that are

348
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,200
provided by the protocols that we use

349
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
commonly such as PGP or s/mime actually

350
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,940
go against a lot of the security and

351
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,550
privacy goals that many people have so

352
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,020
they wanted something where users could

353
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,730
authenticate one another and verify the

354
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,950
integrity of messages without being able

355
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,680
to prove that the other party

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,850
necessarily said any of those messages

357
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,970
in the future to some third party so

358
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,770
this is your response to the fact that

359
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,600
but if you have something like PGP and

360
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,440
you compromised someone with keys

361
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,420
can lose the confidentiality and what's

362
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,850
worse is in PGP for example if you're

363
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,010
using digital signatures you're

364
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,290
providing proof of authorship so let us

365
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,480
think about if suddenly the crypto is

366
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,090
broken but also you have provided proof

367
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,800
of authorship there is something that

368
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,970
you found important enough to be

369
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,860
encrypted that you have signed and said

370
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,830
it's yours but that is suddenly readable

371
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,230
by anyone who has access to this private

372
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,210
key which which once a crypto systems

373
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,620
broken could be pretty much everyone

374
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,350
this is very dangerous so TR provides a

375
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,390
very different use case the authors

376
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,350
argue that these algorithms should have

377
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,970
the uproot opposite properties of what

378
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,170
we want to what we really want is

379
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,820
perfect forward secrecy so if we have a

380
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,040
compromise of long-lived keys our

381
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,410
short-term ephemeral keys are okay and

382
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,390
we're able to on a session by session

383
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,100
basis recruit retain privacy and also

384
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,750
repute ability so that if I'm

385
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,880
communicating with you we can't

386
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,160
necessarily verify to a third party that

387
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,770
I set a given thing so the motivation

388
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,570
for doing this in a quantum safe way and

389
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,780
this is in fact the world's first

390
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,520
quantum resistant end-to-end encrypted

391
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,760
messaging system OTR uniquely proved

392
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,920
deals with cryptographic properties that

393
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,680
many protocols do not and these

394
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
properties are worth studying so as

395
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,220
mentioned these are forward secrecy and

396
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,070
deniable authentication protocols based

397
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,380
on which we are very important in our

398
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,150
modern end-to-end encrypted messaging

399
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,490
systems so for example the signal

400
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,710
protocol is based off of going to be

401
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,230
underlying tools within OTR so things

402
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,530
like signal and things that have from

403
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,070
the signal ideas and the single code

404
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,800
signal code become falling within the

405
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,690
scope of study of the work that we've

406
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,140
done here and then finally any protocol

407
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,730
that is using quantum vulnerable

408
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,710
cryptographic algorithms is not secure

409
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,600
beyond the on advent of large-scale

410
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,360
quantum computation and OTR is one such

411
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,880
protocol so right now we use signal and

412
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,250
we think okay we're secure forever but

413
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,400
in fact the top as an attack that I

414
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,680
mentioned a while back where if you

415
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,630
capture something over the internet and

416
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,280
save it and just wait for a quantum

417
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,190
computer to decrypt it these kinds of

418
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,220
attacks become old

419
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,980
it so we need to think about what

420
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,870
quantum proofing them would look like so

421
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,640
this table is a bit dense and maybe we

422
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,710
don't have to go into it in extensive

423
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,510
depth but there are several algorithms

424
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,060
that are made use of an OT are of course

425
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,830
by no fault of beauty our authors

426
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,390
because these are the standard best

427
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,370
practice algorithms until we started

428
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,080
thinking about quantum script analysis

429
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,420
that are vulnerable to quantum attacks

430
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,580
so difficult and key agreement for

431
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,010
example is not quantum safe at all

432
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,080
it is used to establish ephemeral shared

433
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,330
secrets shared secrets between Alice and

434
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,230
Bob before they have their AES and

435
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,700
symmetric cryptography so we want to

436
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,140
replace this with a quantum safety

437
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,310
exchange and in fact this is exactly

438
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,660
what we did they use AES 128 in counter

439
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,520
mode now this is used for encryption

440
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,890
once they have the shared secret and

441
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,780
it's used in stream cipher mode for

442
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,270
plausible for durability so that other

443
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,130
people could Forge the messages after

444
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,880
the fact to reduce the non-repudiation

445
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,430
practices and what we really want to

446
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,050
replace this with is something like a es

447
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,660
256 so for those of us that have been

448
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,910
following the discussion of quantum safe

449
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,740
cryptography you will know that

450
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,690
symmetric key cryptosystems has their

451
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,110
effective bits security cut in half so a

452
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,010
es 256 in a post quantum world becomes

453
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,360
aes 128

454
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
aes 128 becomes 64 bits of security

455
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,170
which is export level terrible crypto

456
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,760
that really doesn't preserve us at all

457
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,940
so let's keep going they also make use

458
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,990
of 128-bit truncated sha-1 this is

459
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,430
somewhat quantum safe there's some

460
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,619
discretion of the quantum safety of

461
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,200
secure hash algorithm implementations

462
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,089
but the bigger thing here is the 128

463
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,030
bits so we need something that allows

464
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,310
for more bits of quantum safe security

465
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,460
for hm X and I'm hoping that as I'm

466
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,200
talking through this you're hearing

467
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,660
words that you hear with many protocols

468
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,680
that you're dealing with in your

469
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,570
everyday life so maybe if you're not

470
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,730
someone who focuses explicitly on OTR

471
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,440
you're familiar with diffie-hellman key

472
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,670
agreement and you're familiar with

473
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,710
symmetric key cryptography and you're

474
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,910
thinking about what are these things

475
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,800
that I use every day that are also

476
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,410
vulnerable to the exact same quantum

477
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,360
attacks that this OTR protocol is

478
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,850
vulnerable to continuing on they make

479
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,580
use of message authentication codes at

480
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,500
least whether these are quantum register

481
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,270
depends if the hard problem that the Mac

482
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,730
is based on is resistant to quantum

483
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,920
attacks so there's been proposals by for

484
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,320
example dan Bonet that offer quantum

485
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,910
resistant message authentication codes

486
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,770
but we should assume if something is not

487
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,120
stated quantum resistance that it

488
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,400
perhaps isn't and you can look further

489
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,110
into the research about which our

490
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,970
problems are broken to better understand

491
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,510
that so without that quantum safe Mac we

492
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,980
don't have the reputable mutual

493
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,600
authentication of Alice and Bob for each

494
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,880
message and then finally they use

495
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,290
digital signatures at the very beginning

496
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,150
to authenticate that first message to

497
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,790
each other and this is not secured on so

498
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,070
the existing digital signature is based

499
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,970
on component prime type problems are not

500
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,040
quantum safe and therefore this is the

501
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,010
reason that we need to replace it in OTR

502
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,590
this is the reason that we can't have

503
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,660
secure software distribution so as we

504
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,760
all woke up tomorrow and a quantum

505
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,250
computer became available and let's

506
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,010
assume you're using using Windows then

507
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,410
you're installing a Windows Update you

508
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,059
wouldn't actually be able to receive a

509
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,770
verified update from your vendor and

510
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,080
this is true for any secure software

511
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,440
distribution this is also true for

512
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,080
upgrades to software within corporate

513
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,330
environments so when you can't have

514
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,740
secure software distribution you

515
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,960
suddenly cut off the access to ever

516
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,490
making things better and this is very

517
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,980
scary

518
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,549
so this ot our project demonstrates a

519
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:24,740
few things so one of them is that

520
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,570
quantum proofing is not just making use

521
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,910
of a drop-in replacement for sweet it's

522
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,440
not just saying what's something that's

523
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,169
quantum safe that can replace RSA let's

524
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,809
put that in the Declaration of cipher

525
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:36,980
Suites and we're good to go

526
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,169
in fact retooling can and often is

527
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,380
required preservation of the security

528
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,790
properties that we care about and this

529
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,860
is why I've chosen OTR is that we

530
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,809
require secure cryptographic algorithms

531
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:49,309
so we require like a quantum safe

532
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,169
cryptographic algorithm but we also

533
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,090
require very careful protocol design

534
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,860
choices so while we may think about

535
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,179
being able to do a quantum safe version

536
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,310
of PGP or we may supply

537
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,530
specific protocols that we want to cut

538
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,240
and prove if there's certain ones that

539
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,130
offer privacy properties that we are not

540
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,840
getting anywhere else and we do not want

541
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,640
to improve them we suddenly lose access

542
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,290
to those privacy properties that we've

543
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,810
previously enjoyed the quantum safe

544
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,940
algorithm is selected to replace things

545
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,980
like RSA diffie-hellman additional

546
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,020
signatures will likely differ so like

547
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,670
there's many examples of things that

548
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,680
could replace RSA in quantum world or

549
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,360
things that could replace digital

550
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,250
signatures or things that could replace

551
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,980
diffie-hellman key agreement and the

552
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,450
reason that a lot of them like some of

553
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,370
them have been around for 40 years but

554
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,900
the reason that a lot of them have not

555
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,850
necessarily been selected could be

556
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,860
performance limitations could be lack of

557
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,590
script analysis so we have to think

558
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,810
about for each specific protocol what

559
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,760
are the things we really care about so

560
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,920
what are the performance limitations for

561
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,530
that protocol for example in tor they

562
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,460
found that there were some very small

563
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,410
windows that they had to work with and

564
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,620
some of the potential quantum resistant

565
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,180
algorithms were not suitable for that

566
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,070
and the people who worked on that

567
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,390
project had to talk to the Tor project

568
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,400
about what those changes would look like

569
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,920
we have to think also about the research

570
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,320
resource constraints of the device so if

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,780
we have bigger key sizes or longer key

572
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,520
generation times or whatever it happens

573
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,530
to be and we think about emerging use

574
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,840
cases like the Internet of Things

575
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,730
suddenly we have a problem where crypto

576
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,710
is growing to become become quite large

577
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,570
and our computers are becoming quite

578
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,580
small and maybe they can't handle what

579
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,110
we're doing so there's a lot of nuance

580
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,630
to this discretion finally we have to

581
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,460
think about security needs and security

582
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,030
performance trade-off now let's see I'm

583
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,820
at 20 158 okay we will now talk about

584
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,280
open source software this is why many of

585
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,560
you are probably here today

586
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,450
quantum proofing is very hard that open

587
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,310
source software can help us so we have

588
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,020
basically five problems that are

589
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,090
challenges to establishing a quantum

590
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,100
resistant internet I'm going to talk to

591
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,450
mister and talk about why open source

592
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,610
software is the reason that we'll be

593
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,170
able to solve these and it is in fact

594
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,510
the route to solving these problems the

595
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,740
first one is that few reference

596
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,150
implementations of post quantum

597
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,679
algorithms exist and they're not cross

598
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,750
comparable so a lot of mathematicians

599
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,120
come up with really good algorithms yet

600
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,980
very few of them will actually implement

601
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,840
them and the quality of the

602
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,260
implementations and the sort of policies

603
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,789
for things like side-channel attacks

604
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,279
inside channel resistance are different

605
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,620
so we don't really have cross comparable

606
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,480
versions of these protocols actually use

607
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,760
them on the Internet an open source

608
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,740
solution to that might be building a

609
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,809
library of cross comperable post quantum

610
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:37,429
algorithms so that people can experiment

611
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,690
with them a second thing might be we're

612
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,580
not sure of the comparable performance

613
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,470
of different post quantum algorithms so

614
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,809
there's there's many flavors of post

615
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,010
quantum some of them are based on the

616
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,600
aircraft on aircraft codes some of them

617
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,120
are based on lattices some of them are

618
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,559
based on multivariate quadratic

619
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,960
equations some of them are based on

620
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,600
super singular ice oddly ice lodging

621
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,059
these on elliptic curve and these all

622
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,320
perform in different ways and have

623
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,340
different things that are very good

624
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,690
about them and different things that are

625
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,360
not so good about them within an

626
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,950
open-source project we might imagine

627
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,570
that we want apples to apples

628
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,730
benchmarking so that we have unbiased

629
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,020
implementations of all of these

630
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,779
different things to consider and then we

631
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,149
have set to find security criteria we

632
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:24,770
can finally compare them and understand

633
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,809
which one is best

634
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,640
a third problem that we have is that

635
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,590
upgrading protocol cipher Suites is

636
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,440
rarely a simple drop-in substitution so

637
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,419
by having reference implementations of

638
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,429
the algorithms we can finally put them

639
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,169
into protocols and analyze what that

640
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,880
looks like and start to fix those

641
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,059
problems as mentioned there are merging

642
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,909
use cases such as IOT that may further

643
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,039
constrain our choices of algorithms due

644
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,600
to performance but having these

645
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,580
reference implementations allows us for

646
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,070
real-world tests of performance on these

647
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,620
resource limited devices finally the

648
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,480
next RFA is still unknown and this is

649
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,720
something that I can't overemphasize the

650
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,130
standards are not finished

651
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,049
then this competition will go on for a

652
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,179
number of years it will take something

653
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,360
on the order of three years to source

654
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,350
submissions to the algorithmic

655
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,600
competition there will then be a few

656
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,399
years of review there will be the

657
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:18,950
development of the standards there will

658
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,720
be the release of the standards vendors

659
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,909
will have to integrate those into our

660
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:24,980
products and then all of the products

661
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,600
will have to be integrated into a

662
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,350
broader

663
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,360
Ecosystem so if we think about how

664
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,110
quickly quantum computing is creeping up

665
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,419
on us we realize that this is very soon

666
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,220
but this is a very tight deadline that

667
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,990
this is a race that we do not know if we

668
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,230
will win with that said if we rush the

669
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,039
quantum proof we run the risk of missing

670
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,830
out on the algorithms that will actually

671
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,960
be standardized and fulfill compliance

672
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,789
requirements the algorithms that

673
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,770
actually survive all of the rigorous

674
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,419
script analysis is going to happen

675
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:58,730
during the NIST competition so we're

676
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,669
kind of in a difficult spot and the way

677
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,650
that we've proposed to deal with this is

678
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,200
to have a modular API driven library and

679
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,390
hybrid load cryptographic agility to

680
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,190
enable future changes what this

681
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,380
basically means is we want to be able to

682
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,559
combine regular and quantum safe ciphers

683
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,110
together into some hybrid mode that we

684
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,610
haven't quite modular so that you can

685
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,010
pop out which one can save algorithm it

686
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,900
is just suit our needs as our learning

687
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,669
grows and finally to be able to deploy

688
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:30,320
those readily and switch them up and

689
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,900
compare them so I have under 10 minutes

690
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,299
to talk about this next topic and then

691
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:40,309
I'll talk about one final set of remarks

692
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,169
ok

693
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,720
25:59 all right so this is the open

694
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,919
quantum safe project what we have here

695
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,419
is a printout I guess a print screen of

696
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,840
the open quantum safety hub I first

697
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,850
became involved in this project in 2014

698
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,980
and there are many changes to it and

699
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,380
many moving parts it was initially when

700
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,850
I got involved with it really about

701
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,919
benchmarking it was about saying we have

702
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,110
so many quantum resistant algorithms and

703
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,179
we do not know which ones perform the

704
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,039
best level and we don't really know what

705
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,390
the crypt analysis looks like we don't

706
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,799
know if there's other quantum attacks of

707
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,419
them but let's set that aside we don't

708
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,970
even know how they perform so there was

709
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,799
this ambitious idea that we came up with

710
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,960
us that was what if we implemented all

711
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,970
of them like what if we just coded up

712
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,299
every algorithm that exists that is a

713
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,520
serious contender for the future to

714
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,830
replace something like RSA and we

715
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,600
started looking at how they perform

716
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,300
so this project

717
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,860
if that and there's been many people who

718
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,300
have joined it since that have made many

719
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,690
significant contributions and it kind of

720
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,100
evolved over time so we started to

721
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,290
realize let's think about the different

722
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,420
differential performance of these

723
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,190
different with quantum crypto systems

724
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,470
what if they're too slow for a given use

725
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,570
case what if they're too computationally

726
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,760
expensive for a given protocol what if

727
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,650
they don't work for specific use cases

728
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,470
that we're seeing in the future so when

729
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,660
we think about the Internet of Things

730
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,910
there's many they have to deal with many

731
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,380
smaller keys but since there are

732
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,940
ephemeral we might be able to deal with

733
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,580
something a bit more restricted and that

734
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,080
has a different performance and security

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,350
trade-off and the big thing and maybe I

736
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,030
haven't mentioned this yet maybe has

737
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,060
alluded to it to be able to upgrade

738
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,190
anything we use on the Internet

739
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,490
to be able to upgrade like TLS x.509

740
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,170
certificates IPSec tor SSH any of these

741
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,080
or protocols that we make use of we need

742
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,850
to figure out what the cipher suites are

743
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,190
going to look like inside of them and

744
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,840
that's really been kind of the driving

745
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,900
and ongoing motivation for this work the

746
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,370
objectives of course were the reference

747
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,020
implementations and the benchmarks that

748
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,790
I've mentioned but of course I have to

749
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,050
highlight the great work of did

750
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,110
Bernstein who created the bench crypto

751
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,840
benchmarking suite even before we

752
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,730
started talking about this and we're

753
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,660
starting very aggressively and in a very

754
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,880
high-quality way to start benchmarking

755
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,680
things so that prior art should

756
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,030
definitely be acknowledged because it's

757
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,180
very important before we keep going I

758
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,770
should offer a disclaimer about this

759
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,480
software if you go home and you want to

760
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,430
start playing with it it is

761
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,720
research-grade

762
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,690
do not put this into production in fact

763
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,160
the reason that I'm here is I'd like

764
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,890
many of you to tell me why it's broken

765
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,260
so please play with it please attack it

766
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,080
please tell me that my random number

767
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,790
generator is that although I think it's

768
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,390
probably all right but look through it

769
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,130
and find if there's any attacks any

770
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,750
emerging attacks on cryptography that

771
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,880
you know of that are going to break

772
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,950
these systems and please reach out to us

773
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,620
this is very very important so I guess

774
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,270
if you're wanting to get involved in

775
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,340
this project there's a few things you

776
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,040
can do you can give us feedback on our

777
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,120
gie and whether you think it's

778
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,820
appropriate or if it's missing anything

779
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,710
you can definitely provide security

780
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,170
review so code security review of the

781
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,600
software that's been implemented if you

782
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,310
personally are a researcher in quantum

783
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,060
safe security you can give us your

784
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,470
postpone and key exchange algorithm and

785
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,640
we can integrate it of course

786
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,420
attributing credit to you into this

787
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,730
extensible usable software suite and

788
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,990
then if you are from the broader

789
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,580
community who is maybe not a post

790
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,960
quantum cryptography or even a

791
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,970
cryptographer but you're interested in

792
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,360
guidance for putting quantum resistant

793
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,310
ciphers into your existing protocols we

794
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,140
can also help you with that and the

795
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,850
contact information for that is on

796
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,290
github now this is maybe this project is

797
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,700
not something I should have presented at

798
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,640
blackhat maybe it belongs at like a post

799
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,260
quantum cryptography conference and

800
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,300
there were very deliberate reasons that

801
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,250
I selected presenting it before this

802
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,980
specific highly technical highly diverse

803
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,010
security community audience the first

804
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,360
thing is that it really needs to leave

805
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,430
the post quantum crypto community we

806
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,840
don't know everything we know a lot of

807
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,180
things about post quantum crypto but we

808
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,940
do not really understand to the fullest

809
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,010
extent possible the world in which this

810
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,350
crypto has to live and we need people to

811
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,180
use it and tell us what's broken and

812
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,710
tell us what their needs really are I

813
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,960
was what the performance limitations are

814
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,330
where it's breaking for you where it's

815
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,220
not working for you what you really need

816
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,610
from an algorithm we need you to teach

817
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,650
us about the security of the algorithms

818
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,170
we need you to break them but we also

819
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,330
think that we can help you to quantum

820
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,510
proof your systems and teach about what

821
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,040
the performance will look like when

822
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,330
these new algorithms are eventually

823
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,460
released as a result of for example in

824
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,100
this competition we hope that this work

825
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,500
provides a reference model for

826
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,660
developers who are interested in looking

827
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,420
at post quantum cryptography and if

828
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,640
you're looking to use this software it's

829
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,560
released under an MIT license although

830
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,840
some of the ciphers that are included

831
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,940
are under less constrained licenses than

832
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,610
that or different licenses than that

833
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,960
so for example if you've heard of the

834
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,700
New Hope protocol that is also included

835
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,110
as a part of Lib ODS and is released I

836
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,910
believe in the public domain

837
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,130
there's a random number generator based

838
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,780
on the cha-cha 20 which is under a

839
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,090
different license and so forth

840
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,799
the main contents of this software

841
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,059
library if you're going to take a look

842
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,400
are the algorithmic implementations as

843
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,860
well as the API and the API is allowing

844
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,419
for modular build it's allowing for us

845
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,950
to create wrappers didn't great older

846
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,440
things into the work so if we are

847
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,970
putting it all together I think that

848
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,030
it's created in such a way that it

849
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,980
really enables interoperability enables

850
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,690
transparency and review and I'm hoping

851
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,850
that this will serve as something that

852
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,390
is a critical step forward and in fact

853
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,980
an early step forward that we probably

854
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,890
wouldn't have had for several years were

855
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,789
it not for this project I worried prior

856
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:51,789
to doing this that there would be this

857
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:54,640
onslaught of desire for quantum

858
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,260
resistant cryptography and it would

859
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,169
remain primarily in the private or

860
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,500
governmental sectors and that the

861
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,330
broader Internet community would not

862
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,190
have access to specialist knowledge for

863
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,620
a very long time this project is an

864
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,650
attempt to combat that so I hope that

865
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,710
people will make the most of it and and

866
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,809
do things with it that are kind of

867
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,880
beyond what I've imagined so to talk a

868
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,799
bit about the future of the project so

869
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,020
we have kind of the main part of the

870
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,990
libraries the live oak us this involves

871
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,520
presently key exchange but we're

872
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,080
intending to extend it as well to

873
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,059
digital signatures right now we have

874
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:38,620
different examples from many different

875
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,320
types of most one in crypto the types

876
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,049
are the blue boxes along the bottom so

877
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,750
we have the new hope raynella Beauty we

878
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,679
have the BNF bcnf from 2015 that was

879
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,840
used to put into open ssl for the

880
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,840
world's first quantum resistant TLS

881
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,090
implementation we have the frodo scheme

882
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,090
based on learning with errors problem we

883
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,070
are presently working on a quasi cyclic

884
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,110
moderate density parity check version

885
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,179
from code based cryptography code base

886
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:09,039
cryptography is very interesting as

887
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,960
you're familiar with the nucleus crypto

888
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,419
system it's been studied very well

889
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:15,130
equipped analyzed for the last 40 years

890
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,290
and it remains very strong

891
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,910
there are some performance trade-offs

892
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,770
for sure but this is something also that

893
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,620
we consider there's the untrue crypto

894
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,120
system that's being brought into this

895
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,030
library some work by colleagues in

896
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,000
Microsoft Research is dealing with the

897
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,920
super singular isogen ease so there's

898
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,930
many exciting things on the horizon many

899
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,180
things that are already there but

900
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,550
certainly many other examples that will

901
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,370
be extended in the coming months now to

902
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,680
go up to higher higher and higher levels

903
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,320
beyond this we would like to integrate

904
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,000
into more protocol so right now we have

905
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,490
a fork of OpenSSL

906
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,210
we have a fork of OCR the OTR fork is

907
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,760
really an alpha and I consider holding

908
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,230
off on using it for a little while but

909
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,330
it is something that we're building out

910
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,540
and then there are many other much other

911
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,550
consideration for popular protocols that

912
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,949
I probably will touch immediately but

913
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,630
that you will see in the research in the

914
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,030
upcoming month and this this image right

915
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,800
here is credited to Douglas to be lap

916
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,659
I'm I think at nine minutes on this I'll

917
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,340
leave the project alone but maybe like

918
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,000
to move into some final remarks so let's

919
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,199
talk about what could happen in the

920
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,790
future because talking about quantum

921
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,679
safe cryptography is really worrying

922
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,760
about our future selves and let's let's

923
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,620
think also about the future of open

924
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,179
source software because we're coming to

925
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,710
a critical juncture where we're seeing

926
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,540
you know there's a battleground issue in

927
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,510
technology and there is an open source

928
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,360
software solution and whether or not

929
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,980
this is something that is recognized or

930
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,389
this is something that is understood or

931
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,620
this is something that is fought back

932
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,800
against will tell us a lot about the

933
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,870
health of our democracy and technology

934
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,700
and the health of our technical

935
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,370
ecosystem so sometimes researchers can't

936
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,980
say everything that they want to say

937
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,450
sometimes researchers can't speak fully

938
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,180
about their technologies generally for

939
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,950
reasons that are entirely beyond and

940
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,430
unrelated to the technology itself

941
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,810
sometimes the ownership of a technology

942
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,670
is disputed in the whole world is left

943
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,950
waiting for it this happens with

944
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,190
software all the time so in the example

945
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,900
of quantum computers we can extend this

946
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,540
idea further it's no longer about profit

947
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,490
from software sales

948
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,710
information is very powerful and as such

949
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,980
access to the tools that preserve the

950
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,110
security of information is a place of

951
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,100
tremendous geopolitical power who owns

952
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,080
these tools and who has access to this

953
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,880
information will not necessarily be

954
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,920
front-page news

955
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,810
now let's think what else is true about

956
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,760
researchers because I think this work is

957
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,890
really the humanity of this work is

958
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,540
really about the relationship between

959
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,130
researchers and between researchers and

960
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,080
entities of power and the ways that

961
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,270
researchers translate work into

962
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,270
something that is inherently powerful so

963
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,090
what is true about researchers

964
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,950
technological globalization often hinges

965
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,860
upon interoperable global standards so

966
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,300
standards also set quality and

967
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,619
confidence measures throughout the

968
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,690
global supply chain and we've seen

969
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,210
examples before where security standards

970
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,880
have failed us so in general how do we

971
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,730
prevent this from happening I personally

972
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,260
believe that it is within the

973
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,869
transparency and openness in all stages

974
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:34,780
of the standardization process but

975
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,730
sometimes standards bodies may choose to

976
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,680
restrict discussion of open source

977
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,869
software as a general statement I

978
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,850
believe this is an incredible problem in

979
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,190
cryptography where auditability and

980
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,560
interoperability and user accountability

981
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,900
are so critical I think it is important

982
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,040
that we not only have a healthy

983
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,750
skepticism toward the standards that we

984
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,880
see but also toward the process that

985
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,040
creates them and this is why I hope many

986
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,690
of you will get involved and criticize

987
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,150
this work while there is no perfect

988
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,380
model for this I think that

989
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,180
organizations offering open mailing

990
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,790
lists for discussion transparent

991
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,130
evaluation criteria and to actively

992
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,750
consider a breadth of research and

993
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,270
software in the public domain are in my

994
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,910
opinion the most relevant channels for

995
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,590
the discussion and the best hope for the

996
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,630
kind of Internet that we really want and

997
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,640
I should note that I do commend mist on

998
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,859
this work so far and I'm excited to see

999
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:27,130
where the openness of this work goes in

1000
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,040
general it's been a very pleasing

1001
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,880
process and I'm very excited now also

1002
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,560
notice some the fact that sometimes

1003
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,210
researchers are pushed out of their

1004
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,800
fields and this is why I open source

1005
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
software is important because it lives

1006
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,340
beyond us right sometimes researchers

1007
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,050
find new problems to solve

1008
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,880
sometimes researchers leave for one has

1009
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,860
a million of their reasons and it's very

1010
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,480
important that the knowledge that a

1011
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,490
small number of specialists has is not

1012
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,800
held in the silos of academia or in

1013
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,960
private R&D labs or in specialist

1014
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,030
conferences and this is why your

1015
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,620
attention to open source software this

1016
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,530
project but also in general matters

1017
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,590
because if software is not killed off by

1018
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,020
competing interests than truly open open

1019
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,120
source software enables an incredible

1020
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,530
amount of experimentation and

1021
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,690
prototyping first generation

1022
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,270
technologies and cross-disciplinary work

1023
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,280
which ultimately is in fact very

1024
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,380
beneficial to technology companies and

1025
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,390
governments although sometimes people

1026
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,600
are very uncomfortable with open source

1027
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,220
often in the process of creating a

1028
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,340
democratizing technology the process

1029
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,560
itself is not as self liberating but the

1030
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,420
technology can be democratizing in it

1031
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,520
this turn sends us so let's talk about

1032
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,040
what this looks like more and more in

1033
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,210
the last year we hear about the

1034
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,580
importance of quantum safety across time

1035
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,710
we talk about what does it mean if we

1036
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,360
have something that's encrypted with a

1037
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,670
quantum unsafe algorithm it's decrypted

1038
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,280
far into the future but what we haven't

1039
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,930
really talked about is what it means for

1040
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,610
our entire cryptographic infrastructure

1041
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,380
to change this is quite unprecedented

1042
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,870
the amount of taking things apart and

1043
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,430
putting it back together that we have to

1044
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,410
do is absolutely on a scale that we have

1045
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,570
never seen before and the internet has

1046
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,040
never had the impact that it's had

1047
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,020
before so thinking about the kinds of

1048
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,250
properties that we want in our

1049
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,720
cryptographic algorithms and protocols

1050
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,720
is very very important and giant ly

1051
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,470
overlooked

1052
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,320
so not all cryptography is created equal

1053
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,360
not just in terms of its security or in

1054
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,310
terms of its performance but also in

1055
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,470
terms of what a protocol allows so let's

1056
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,880
think about security properties that a

1057
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,010
protocol allows perhaps inspired by the

1058
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,050
work of the OTR project that I

1059
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,840
demonstrated so for example when we're

1060
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,860
thinking about the future of

1061
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,170
cryptography we've asked ourselves do we

1062
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,350
want and I'm not giving my opinion one

1063
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,910
way or the other but rather just posing

1064
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,530
questions to the forks I think there

1065
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,270
will be many diversity of opinions that

1066
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,510
should be heard do we want lawful asset

1067
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,550
access or key escrow to be something

1068
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,110
that is easily implementable in these

1069
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,480
schemes do we care about how the key

1070
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,580
management or the migration to new keys

1071
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,860
looks and what kinds of vulnerabilities

1072
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,880
are introduced in that

1073
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,590
we have to think about the importance of

1074
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,150
post quantum crypto signatures for

1075
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,310
secure code distribution we have to

1076
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,690
think in our protocols do we care about

1077
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,450
forward secrecy do we need key sizes

1078
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,400
small enough 40 generation times fast

1079
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,080
enough that we can have the ephemerality

1080
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,210
that is required to enable forward

1081
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,450
secrecy we need to think about

1082
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,590
resilience against various kinds of

1083
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,119
attacks and what they mean for the

1084
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,280
values we hold and we also have to think

1085
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,410
about authentication should all the

1086
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,510
authentication that's available be non

1087
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,550
reputable should there be examples of

1088
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,859
reputable authentication this depends

1089
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:34,220
entirely on upon context so during times

1090
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,020
of great change things become unstable

1091
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,619
and we see this for example in a in a

1092
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,390
political entity where the reigning

1093
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,550
power is overthrown we see that when

1094
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,980
things become unstable it's very easy

1095
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,650
for a lot of things that were not under

1096
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,600
the intended scope of work to change and

1097
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,980
this is something that I think we must

1098
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,890
be incredibly vigilant of upcoming years

1099
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,510
as all of these standards are updated

1100
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,760
and changed because it is so much change

1101
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,310
and there are so few of us in the

1102
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,380
information security community relative

1103
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,000
to the volume of information that we'll

1104
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,040
have to take in and this is why I'm at

1105
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,600
blackhat today and this is why your eyes

1106
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,040
on this work matters and this is why

1107
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,600
your attention to these topics matters

1108
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,609
so many things will change in the

1109
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:16,130
upcoming years the technological

1110
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,660
development that results from the

1111
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,460
fundamental physics that limits our

1112
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,320
current computers from getting smaller

1113
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,810
and smaller without having to deal with

1114
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,340
quantum effects means that quantum

1115
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,410
computers as far as we know seem

1116
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,359
inevitable they will do many great

1117
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,460
things but it is our responsibility and

1118
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,650
in the process of allowing to do them

1119
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,080
good allowing them to do good things to

1120
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,000
protect us from all of the bad things as

1121
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,220
well post quantum cryptography is the

1122
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,859
ethical response to quantum computers

1123
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:45,109
but the practice of post quantum

1124
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:47,960
cryptography does not necessarily imply

1125
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,220
that it is going to be perfect without

1126
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,869
vigilance to the types of properties

1127
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:56,660
that we're looking for post quantum

1128
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,490
crypto presents many cases where taken

1129
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,410
for granted technologies will need to be

1130
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,630
a result redesigned this is neither

1131
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,040
something that can be left unaddressed

1132
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,109
because quantum computers are coming nor

1133
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,250
is it something that can be accepted

1134
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,200
without question because there are

1135
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,940
nuances to the protocols as we've seen

1136
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,720
that draws one eye

1137
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,160
between their security or their

1138
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,619
vulnerability for example if we look at

1139
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,020
the comparison between export versions

1140
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,910
of various cryptographic algorithms and

1141
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,130
the non export versions we see that

1142
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,099
small changes really really matter in

1143
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:26,960
regard to the side reference for example

1144
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,270
the work presented at blackhat USA 2016

1145
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,160
by David Adrien where he talked about a

1146
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,690
tax freak ground and logjam beyond being

1147
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,310
attentive to our work perhaps my main

1148
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,960
reason for sharing this is that

1149
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,760
hopefully it can empower your community

1150
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,369
of security researchers to begin quantum

1151
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:44,570
proofing the technologies that are

1152
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,460
important to us while the software

1153
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,010
presently available is certainly an

1154
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,570
alpha test I hope that it serves as a

1155
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,270
gateway to understanding I guess I'll

1156
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,800
conclude with the fact that sometimes

1157
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,330
research comes at an absolutely

1158
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,430
incredible personal cost and this is in

1159
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,990
these moments that we realize what is

1160
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,240
most important to us for me is the

1161
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,920
preservation of an Internet where access

1162
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,359
to the safety and freedom of secure

1163
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,010
cryptography is not reserved only for

1164
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,020
those who can pay for it in whatever

1165
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,660
form that takes open source software is

1166
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,280
not about creating something out of

1167
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,470
nothing but rather it is about the many

1168
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,380
cases in which the tangible product of

1169
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,300
giving up so much for what we have is

1170
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,369
done in a fight for something better I

1171
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,640
thank you for joining me today and

1172
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,690
unfortunately I will not be able to take

1173
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,400
questions but I'm happy to speak to you

1174
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,650
after the talk Thanks

1175
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,939
