1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,149
and away we go thank you for coming to

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,670
the lot note session of blackhat 2016

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,269
Thanks anybody have a good time here

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,110
anybody drink for you

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,020
anybody have the free beers anybody have

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,730
a spare free beer because I could really

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,070
use one right now so if anybody could

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,830
bring me one that would be great so I

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,090
want to tell you a little bit about

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,310
what's going on next this is the Locke

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,289
note as opposed to the keynote where we

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,050
try to some summarize some of the topics

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,270
that we saw at blackhat some of the

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,739
threads some of the things we've heard

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,660
in conversation and then what's going to

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,370
happen is I'm just going to have a

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,010
conversation with the other people up

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,050
here and you're going to kind of listen

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,210
in how we're approaching the topics and

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,129
what we're thinking to give you a little

21
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,260
insight and then we're going to open it

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,730
up to Q&A we're going to bring you into

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,129
the conversation and it's going to take

24
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,969
about 45 minutes and I've got some

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,800
statistics to tell you a little bit

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,809
about how the conference is turned out

27
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,659
here every year I like to do this

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,820
normally at the keynote but we're do we

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,689
need to closing so we had 57 different

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,570
countries represented here so that was a

31
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,830
lot more international than I

32
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,130
anticipated and in continuing the

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,460
blackhat tradition of giving away

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,890
sponsorships or fellowships to students

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,439
or academics generally people write

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,110
white papers or research papers and we

37
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,610
review them and then we give away free

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,430
admission to try to help foster people

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,020
who wouldn't normally be able to attend

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,470
and this year we gave away 100 free

41
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,380
passes to academics and researchers and

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,509
students so if anybody is here who got

43
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,950
in on one of those can you raise your

44
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,250
hand right let's hear it for them thank

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,430
you

46
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,820
well done okay so I'm just going to tell

47
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,830
you the top ten countries that only have

48
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,950
one person here so eyes your badge on

49
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,840
the Sun a person Bahrain Bermuda Costa

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,040
Rica Kuwait Latvia Nigeria reunion which

51
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm not sure what country that is

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,550
Slovenia and the Ukraine so thank you

53
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,440
for coming all the way you are the sole

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,560
representative of your country so I hope

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,350
you ask good questions later

56
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,440
so with that said I'd like to first draw

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,420
some attention to one of our key

58
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,360
sponsors silence and I want to introduce

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,190
Anton who's going to say a couple of

60
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,440
words and then we're going to start off

61
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,910
the Locke note so thank you very much

62
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,930
Anton thanks very much and actually I

63
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,760
got a confession did have one of the

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,950
free beers so this might be slightly

65
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,510
longer than two minutes which is what I

66
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,020
was planning and so my observations over

67
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,480
the past couple of days is that we have

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,150
some super smart people gathered here

69
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,320
today a lot smarter than than I am and I

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,170
did my AI research many many years ago

71
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,420
so that's a big confession for me to

72
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,040
make as well what I'm seeing though is

73
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,130
there's a lot of specific and essential

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,709
specialized expertise that we have to

75
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,270
have to fight the sort of current cyber

76
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,230
security landscape and this specificity

77
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,530
is is part of the problem the

78
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,170
specificity that we need and you can use

79
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,970
whatever analogy you want you know once

80
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,730
the bullets left the gun once the genies

81
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,660
out of the bottle

82
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,209
once the worms are out of the can we've

83
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,910
got more and more problems within our

84
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,470
networks and those problems they items

85
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,959
that's a combined Ettore explosion we

86
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,489
end up with more and more things that we

87
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,769
need to do and and really that trend is

88
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,870
also added to the general cyber security

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,650
trend of moving away from prevention and

90
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,890
through to detection and response but by

91
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,900
doing that we've sort of tilted that by

92
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,849
a little bit maybe too far one way and

93
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,599
obviously I'm going to say this because

94
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,079
I'm from silence but I think the good

95
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,600
news is even with the skill shortage and

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,488
I think they after blackhat in the

97
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,560
states there was a survey one of the top

98
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,560
problems was finding enough specialists

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,889
people like yourselves with the right

100
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,900
knowledge and the right tools in order

101
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,169
to combat malware in our systems but

102
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,120
from some of the sessions in fact the

103
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,669
session immediately prior to this one

104
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,100
we've started thinking about machine

105
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,740
learning and artificial intelligence

106
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,750
that might be the key to actually

107
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,539
helping redress the balance so let's get

108
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,090
back to some good prevention allow our

109
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,460
specialists as scarce specialists in

110
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,169
order to focus on the detection response

111
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,710
and rebalance our boat a little bit away

112
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,750
from the tilt that we've got at the

113
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,810
moment so that's my hope that 20 years

114
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,699
ago when I was doing my research we

115
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,199
thought we were on the edge of something

116
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,830
really spectacular we weren't we were

117
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,720
actually a solution looking for a

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,199
problem

119
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,210
and mostly in very poorly controlled

120
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,210
domains and at the moment I think this

121
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,010
this is the time this is the time for

122
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,910
machine learning and artificial

123
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,610
intelligence to make a change but thanks

124
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:32,830
very much if panelists up here on my

125
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,300
right starting from there my right

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,680
what's that

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,720
stage right your left Daniel Cuthbert

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,990
we have Sharon Kahn he D myself Jeff

129
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,409
Moss and Chris White so cool and we're

130
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,180
going to talk about I've got a question

131
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,610
in mind for each one of us specifically

132
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,409
but then we're going to just have a

133
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,590
conversation we're going to start with a

134
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,470
question with Dan Daniel on the IP bill

135
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,260
or the snoopers charter here in the UK

136
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,030
and it seems to be a reflection of

137
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,050
what's happening in a lot of countries

138
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,760
whether it's you know China Australia

139
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,479
the United States the sort of anxiety by

140
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,630
government

141
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,660
that it's getting away from them right

142
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,310
they can't get their hands around this

143
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,500
new type of cybercrime espionage

144
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,020
whatever it is they're feeling like

145
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,250
existing tools aren't working for them

146
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,500
they need new capabilities right whether

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,260
this is the FBI being stressed out about

148
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,010
going dark or the Apple iPhone and so

149
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,670
legislators are rushing to give new

150
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,220
powers new tools to law enforcement and

151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,290
some of the questions are is it the

152
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,720
right tool for the job is it the

153
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,670
expectation from law enforcement is is

154
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,550
wrong it's that law enforcement wants it

155
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,680
to be easy we want the answers to land

156
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,690
on our lap and a clearly formatted XML

157
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,880
file and they don't want to have to do

158
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
the legwork or is this like legitimate

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,310
concern and these are sort of the times

160
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,040
call for these solutions so you are sort

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,990
of you're much more up to speed on the

162
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,090
specifics in the UK but I think this is

163
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,000
a larger problem isn't it it is I mean

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,040
the IP bill has a lot of emotion around

165
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,890
it you know 25 years ago hacking you'd

166
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,870
never expect it to be in the six o'clock

167
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,820
news and it kind of changed with Talk

168
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,400
Talk you know when you had the big boss

169
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,020
of talk talk on the BBC News at six

170
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,880
o'clock because they were breach this is

171
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,430
now in the public eye and I think

172
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,620
there's two camps that are taking abuse

173
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,570
of this there's the criminality and

174
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,370
we've seen it with what's happening in

175
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,110
Russia criminality of the service taking

176
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,270
abuse of what abusing the fact that law

177
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,500
enforcement just don't have these

178
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
capabilities right and we saw that with

179
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,370
the ransomware and incredibly lame like

180
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,560
it's not Afghan if you think docetaxel a

181
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,750
but criminals are abusing this because

182
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,980
they know that law enforcement just

183
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,270
don't have the capabilities by

184
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,860
correspond have know what they're doing

185
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,410
because it's not traditional policing

186
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,330
and then they have the fact that an area

187
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,830
that I'm quite passionate about is the

188
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,290
childhood place exploitation I will turn

189
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,350
off your phones you know we've got a

190
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,320
unfortunately the UK is a big player in

191
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,300
the world of child exploitation and it's

192
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,580
a rather sick sick thing and law

193
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,260
enforcement doesn't have to act because

194
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,760
they're using all the pretty sores it

195
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,880
you guys mostly use tor you know all the

196
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,730
privacy

197
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,770
etc and it's very hard if you're a law

198
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,210
enforcement trying to take down a ring

199
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,520
that's responsible for say 200 gigs

200
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,710
worth of indecent images a month and

201
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,450
when they don't have that capability sky

202
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,940
people I don't envy anybody just going

203
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,650
to trying to write a law because you're

204
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,940
not going to make it in a perfect

205
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,480
everybody

206
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,580
and indeed the I people has got some

207
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,010
awful parts of it but there's some parts

208
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,169
that are trying to make this better such

209
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,820
as what do you think we see this a lot

210
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,470
in the United States they try to bite

211
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,270
off the whole thing in one go yeah

212
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,320
they're not trying to do it in

213
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,730
incremental steps like we'll address

214
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,410
this one will address this one it's

215
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,450
there's this sense that we have to get

216
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,840
it all right now and did you end up with

217
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,150
kind of like a half f measure yeah I

218
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,350
mean you can see that without people

219
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,300
you've got a law that you know relates

220
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,160
to the intelligence services with both

221
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,740
collection and it tries to detail how

222
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,490
they're going to handle that

223
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,290
which is great you've got a law that

224
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,540
details how law enforcement goes it

225
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,180
after active exploitation so this is

226
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,250
proper traditional interceptor we found

227
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,320
a suspect we've got a warrant you know

228
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,610
we want to go after the most you know

229
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,130
pain testers or hackers would do but

230
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,900
it's also got laws that they will know

231
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,850
the internet connections record we want

232
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,970
ISPs to store metadata as we saw with

233
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,400
days talk like metadata is seemingly

234
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,960
harmless and peace not joining the dots

235
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,910
so the law that's trying to appease

236
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,290
everybody and I think that's what the

237
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,910
problem stuff like it's very very very

238
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,120
yeah so then as technologists I mean

239
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,400
where our intersection is if this law

240
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,160
passes in the UK how does that impact us

241
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,410
the impact makers of tools does all of a

242
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,420
sudden you can't run tor anymore I mean

243
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,000
what how does it impact our community so

244
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,770
it's interesting that one of the key

245
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,840
things that a lot of the press centered

246
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,430
on was the fact that there did

247
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,890
backdooring of encryption and you know

248
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,690
the law went through three changes and

249
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,120
it's now past the third times it's about

250
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,130
you made law what the encryption part

251
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,100
says was a company that build encryption

252
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,170
should try and help the police if

253
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,970
there's a warrant and there's they got

254
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,400
the you know the best efforts can assess

255
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,380
effort yeah what a lot of people are

256
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,330
missing reading is that it doesn't mean

257
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,130
you have to backdoor the encryption it

258
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,510
means if you've got the capability if

259
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,830
you've got an encrypted database and

260
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,840
you've got the key trying help them

261
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,790
unlock that it's not put a backdoor on

262
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,080
everything indeed the laws they

263
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,520
a lot of people are reading is that too

264
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,250
much yeah and so then do you think

265
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,990
that's going to change I've heard some

266
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,700
complaints from ISPs but it's going to

267
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,990
be so expensive we're going to have to

268
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,030
store so much data and once you start

269
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,860
aggregating that data it's like now

270
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,730
you're putting all your eggs in one

271
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,360
basket

272
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,070
now the economies of scale if that would

273
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,990
be a really tempting target I mean

274
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,430
imagine if you're an investigative

275
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,440
reporter or in the United States it

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,190
would be let's say you're in a lawsuit a

277
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,390
divorce a messy divorce with your wife

278
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,460
they perform discovery because they're

279
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,390
trying to find out if you're cheating

280
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,610
you have hidden money somewhere well now

281
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,080
you go to your ISP and you can get the

282
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,400
browsing history of your wife or your

283
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,280
husband for the last five years that's

284
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,740
going to be abused unless you can

285
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,740
restrict it right so thankfully the Lord

286
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,630
does restrict to us access to our cells

287
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,030
and sexual records are generally the

288
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,370
police but there's one slight area that

289
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,500
concerns me and that other body are the

290
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,450
public bodies have access to that as

291
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,370
soon as we know although tax authorities

292
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,740
and yet there's a whole list and it's

293
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,450
really worrying because traditionally

294
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,160
these body is not and very good at

295
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,530
securing stuff and as an industry we

296
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,170
really suck at making stuff secure so

297
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,750
it's only inevitable before the ICR

298
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,060
breach happens and you know everything

299
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,530
you browse now the ICL records are

300
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,360
interesting it's not the contents of the

301
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,340
fire browser it's the fight you visited

302
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,980
so we know that you visitors tinder or

303
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,960
reddit or something else that donating

304
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,640
time yeah I mean that part bothers me I

305
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,160
want to turn to you sure any thoughts on

306
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,320
this on this topic yeah yeah the I mean

307
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
I think it really came to light for me

308
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
was the Apple you know FBI case you know

309
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,960
that that really and it just remains

310
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,000
sort of unresolved right so it just

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
seems like something that's just going

312
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,950
to keep hanging hanging out there but

313
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,620
because of because of the the way that

314
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,970
is I think more people that are

315
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,160
designing systems are going to design

316
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,460
them such that they they don't have the

317
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,290
keys right like Apple has sort of set

318
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,880
this standard yeah they're sort of

319
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,380
design yourself out of the problem

320
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,880
design yourself out of the problem like

321
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,579
I will save money as

322
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,350
business I won't have complaints from

323
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,230
customers if I don't have the capability

324
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,429
and this is something that you know

325
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,079
security people have been saying that's

326
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,939
a good security design right for a long

327
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:44,939
long time and now it seems like it's

328
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,350
also a good you know customer

329
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,449
relationship and so little design

330
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,369
because you're not you're not you're not

331
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,100
fighting your own law enforcement and

332
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,660
you're not in arguments constantly with

333
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,540
your own law enforcement right any time

334
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,649
I think in ways as being strange and

335
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,389
disappointing week for the average

336
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:06,689
member of the British public they told

337
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:09,689
us that you voted wrong can break this

338
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,100
and now they're saying well you know

339
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,049
your data it's not review yours anyway

340
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:15,029
right and you're not even going to cut

341
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,319
in and get a discount on your car

342
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:18,089
insurance work right right yeah which

343
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,410
we're definitely going to get to is that

344
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,119
that's now what happens with that

345
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:25,259
metadata and so what I'm wondering in

346
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:26,670
the United States we have the First

347
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,799
Amendment and one of the big questions

348
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,739
is can you build a secure system is that

349
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:34,739
permissible under this bill if you build

350
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,899
a system it doesn't retain the metadata

351
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,119
or there's no logs to keep are they

352
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,350
going to force you to turn on all the

353
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,019
logs the product is about design did not

354
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,059
have logs is that permissible and so

355
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,350
there's this unresolved question the

356
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,600
United States can you legally build a

357
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,139
totally secure system or are you going

358
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,360
to be forced to always have this sort of

359
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,489
exceptional access so I don't know how

360
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:59,059
that even played out so we must dedicate

361
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,529
everybody knows Moxie Marlinspike the

362
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:04,049
hair should be using signal to three

363
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,269
weeks ago he shared a I believe let be

364
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,549
our subpoena for connection records and

365
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,679
he said yes yeah here it is and there

366
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,230
was a two line saying epoch time

367
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,269
connected he's locked I'm disconnected

368
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,549
that's it that's all I saw whitey here

369
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:19,230
he met with the conditions but it's

370
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,850
thought it didn't give actually anything

371
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,129
I think that's probably maybe uses the

372
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,739
first example of a secure messaging

373
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,149
system that just doesn't store anything

374
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,679
and I don't know what happened to moxie

375
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,989
sense yeah as if he's had a in a quick

376
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:33,689
visit by coming in down but you know we

377
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,790
will find out the blackout your so yeah

378
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,499
so so now I want to talk a little bit

379
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,299
about then about this metadata question

380
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,769
so let's say we do generate this

381
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:41,840
metadata

382
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,970
and there was this admiral insurance

383
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,150
case that kind of hit fair bit of media

384
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,010
coverage and i guess what they were

385
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,830
doing is using data from Facebook to API

386
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,970
Facebook gather information and metadata

387
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,470
that was useful to their insurance

388
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,600
actuarial table and then they were

389
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,330
starting to apply that to their customer

390
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,030
base which is clearly not what Facebook

391
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,890
was intending when they were gathering

392
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,390
this data or maybe Facebook got a little

393
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,610
jealous that they weren't monetizing

394
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,850
your data that way so why don't you walk

395
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,320
us through that a little bit sure it's a

396
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,240
festival from what I understand Facebook

397
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,240
have disabled is a advisable the public

398
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,780
republic or about it and but it was an

399
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,750
opt-in solution for first-time drivers

400
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,210
and give access to their social media

401
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,830
profiles and so that you had to click a

402
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,320
box it does or you until your insurance

403
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,360
company site and gave them your login as

404
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,730
part of the quote so they would look

405
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,740
just during the club processor they

406
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,600
claim there's no ongoing access older

407
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,730
days okay so one time piece yeah exactly

408
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,750
so they came and and this could result

409
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,450
in reduction skier car insurance of up

410
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,520
to 350 pounds a year which was quite

411
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,380
significant not get in the way of data

412
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,140
for nothing in this case yeah and they

413
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,160
claims that there wouldn't be any

414
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,470
increases in insurance premium for it

415
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,320
all any decreases yeah we benefit yeah

416
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,970
so what they're saying is we're going to

417
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,760
make less money if you give us your data

418
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,840
and someone's going to pay for that

419
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,520
somewhere along the line or is it the

420
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,110
people who don't talk them to do this

421
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,120
who are going to pay for it right but

422
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,190
also what's fascinating about it is the

423
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,440
data they were actually looking for so a

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,140
fresh dance it has nothing whatsoever to

425
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,530
do with your driving skills and you know

426
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,810
it was an occasion the UK earlier this

427
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,340
year for someone posted on Twitter

428
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,950
something along the lines of well I just

429
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,450
clips of cyclists oh yeah those are

430
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,100
connections that kind of data you can

431
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,950
nearly understand it as but they are

432
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,830
looking at personality traits that

433
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,320
correspond to safe drivers and the

434
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,330
personality traits that they've outlined

435
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,830
are really

436
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,100
thing it's tough like and you have a cat

437
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,490
do you prefer cart argue conscientious

438
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,580
so do you write in bullet pointless and

439
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,400
do you use proper grammar and do you

440
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,930
arrange to meet with your friends such a

441
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,000
certain time and place rather than just

442
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,709
saying vaguely to mice which from a

443
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,660
security perspective longer in social

444
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,190
media mister going out so a certain

445
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,599
place at a certain time doesn't say

446
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,640
conscientious to leave I had thought

447
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,170
there's all kinds of fascination

448
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,000
meanings that they're collecting not

449
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,740
necessarily about driving and it also

450
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,119
turned out they were doing this in an

451
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,760
ongoing fashion and what they would look

452
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,890
at your historical data I mean if this

453
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm not sure really got off the ground

454
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,820
but I'm sure it will eventually right

455
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,510
right so it reminds me of the back in

456
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,880
the United States Netflix yeah years ago

457
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,870
released a set of anonymized data a like

458
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,480
newer behavior and then I think a well

459
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,370
did that and Comcast and a lot of these

460
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,510
companies we're trying to do the right

461
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,090
thing sharing large data sets with the

462
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,130
community or with with the public and

463
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,110
then academic community other people

464
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,300
would analyze it and use it for some

465
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,520
public good and in every case every

466
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,060
large data set be anonymized and so it

467
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,820
brings up this question of can we even

468
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,650
share this data for public good without

469
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,930
it getting D anonymized or becoming so

470
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,640
anonymous that it's essentially useless

471
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,310
and I've heard people talk about putting

472
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,250
data in the giant pools apples got

473
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,300
something where they're trying to take

474
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,710
your data and put you in the giant pool

475
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,540
then they claim they can't figure out

476
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,640
who the individuals are but I'm curious

477
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,020
from a security standpoint of your

478
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,000
perspective where does this lead I mean

479
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,790
is this and yet a new thing will have to

480
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,970
be worried about yeah I think absolutely

481
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,070
it is and I've been for several talks

482
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,740
and I'd like past Europe over the last

483
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,360
couple of days that have talked about

484
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,150
the importance of metadata and I love

485
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,160
the examples are several sources given

486
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,110
about the uber right of glory it has

487
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,340
been a brilliant example of how however

488
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,020
over using the information what kinda

489
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,340
great information you can get from that

490
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,370
and yeah I worry about a lot of

491
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,600
information we're giving away on a

492
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,880
day-to-day basis as we become

493
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,850
increasingly more connected and people

494
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,620
just aren't really that worried about it

495
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,290
if there was

496
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,630
a treatment period you have any any

497
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,520
thoughts on this on the metadata issue

498
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,130
yeah I don't really carry that it like

499
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,440
security you don't feel the pain of your

500
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,570
decisions quickly like will touch the

501
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,300
hot plate immediate feedback but how

502
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,980
would you ever know that that post you

503
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,540
made on Facebook six months ago just

504
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,600
cost you 20 quid like you can't connect

505
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,400
the action with the consequence and so

506
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,650
therefore to our brains we just doesn't

507
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,190
exist

508
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,440
well one aspect of it especially with

509
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
Facebook I mean Facebook's been around

510
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,150
for like 10 years now and so you're just

511
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,950
getting more and more of a percentage of

512
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,610
a person's life

513
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,770
lifetime right there and I don't think

514
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,910
they actually ever really delete

515
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,650
anything do they if you put it in there

516
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,270
I think they even require you imagine

517
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,530
everybody that started when they're 16

518
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,960
another 26 so they even ripped me

519
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,270
exactly and they Facebook even records

520
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,860
when you when you when you type a note

521
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,320
and then you decide I don't really want

522
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,940
to post that like you think about it you

523
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,170
say I don't want to post that and you

524
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,660
cancel yeah it control ages or for youth

525
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,670
or you delete it they they record that

526
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,280
so I mean the amount of data is pretty

527
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,580
amazing and I don't know if we quite

528
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,980
have the implications of that yet but

529
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,990
then joining it with other data sets and

530
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,200
that that's when you can't really tell

531
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,970
what the implications of a Facebook post

532
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,950
is because you don't know what someone

533
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,540
else is going to other data sets they're

534
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,700
going to join that with right right so

535
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,160
it's it's kind of like you say it's just

536
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,810
a problem that we just don't know the

537
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,880
impact of it yet yeah that immediacy or

538
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,620
lack of immediacy I'm wondering if

539
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,850
that's just something we're going to be

540
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,920
hobbled with as a society because we

541
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,750
don't we can't make that connection and

542
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,250
somebody with our security engineer

543
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,540
who's trying to figure out for Safe

544
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,980
Browsing remember when everybody was

545
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,660
concerned about safe browsing like that

546
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,360
was going to save us and they were

547
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,620
saying that you know when you drive your

548
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,970
car and you reach a certain speed

549
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,570
sometimes auto in Auto engineers build

550
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,570
in that the steering wheel shakes and it

551
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,310
gives you feedback like hey you're doing

552
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,140
something dangerous so the idea was what

553
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,550
if you're like mousing over a dangerous

554
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,710
link and your mouse goes like Mariner I

555
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,360
say that's that

556
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,700
don't click on that we don't have those

557
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,670
kinds of cues and I think the worst is

558
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,050
the metadata because you're not even

559
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,510
saying I'm sharing my data it's like an

560
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,500
abstracted concept and I think that

561
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,080
where do the bad guys go with this these

562
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,240
are the Facebook's of the world what

563
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,830
about it does this have any implication

564
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,230
in the underground economy or in the

565
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,510
criminal economies because right now the

566
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,710
only people that seem to be able to

567
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,170
monetize this are legit businesses that

568
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,510
are potentially regulated I'm just

569
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,890
curious what happens when it breaks out

570
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,890
of that world into another and I think

571
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,420
you know some people were talking about

572
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,360
the earlier talk on mobile security and

573
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,240
how in some dark net markets people were

574
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,850
buying or creating fake companies to get

575
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,740
access to the interconnect Network and

576
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,570
then they were selling access to that

577
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,220
but their be able to collect metadata on

578
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,530
where each mobile devices and what the

579
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,320
mobile numbers are and so now if there's

580
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,150
like a parallel sort of metadata dart

581
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,630
market I'm just very surprised if there

582
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,600
wasn't yeah there must be evil marketing

583
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,440
companies yeah is there anything not an

584
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
evil marketing company is there like a

585
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,300
non evil marketing company either

586
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,770
annoyed the marketers that chorus there

587
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,090
Courtney no they are powerful you mean

588
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,910
Russian hackers any day it was a head of

589
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,010
marketing for I worked secure computing

590
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,750
I just remember this quote from her she

591
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,370
said I'm wasting half of my marketing

592
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,860
budget I just don't know which hat but

593
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,900
that's that's a family favorite famous

594
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,190
marketing quote that's how they think

595
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,080
you know I'm losing money somewhere I

596
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,140
just don't know where so I've got a

597
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,950
question for you Chris so a longtime

598
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,590
hacker and you said one of you talks you

599
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,600
really were interested in here was the

600
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,940
the rootkit the persistence on TLC's

601
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,250
sure he's embedded devices with limited

602
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,400
constrained resources and you know he

603
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,620
started looking at PLC's and ICS stuff

604
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,950
eight years plus he go and I just

605
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,600
figured that had been farmed out you

606
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,790
know Greenfield was gone they're pretty

607
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,560
well understood space now we're into

608
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,750
other things we're into you know IOT

609
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,930
devices but the hits keep on coming with

610
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,300
PLC's yeah one of the things I noticed

611
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,850
was just in general as a

612
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,250
conference it was just more and better

613
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,410
tooling around you know internet of

614
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,170
things hacking firmware hacking cars I'm

615
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,660
hearing around its getting better yet so

616
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,350
it's just it does keep improving and so

617
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,760
that means that there's obviously a lot

618
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,410
of vulnerabilities to be found if these

619
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,570
people are building tools right right

620
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,120
and one thing that I've just learned

621
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,340
over time is until there's enough

622
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,080
sufficient tools out there to attack a

623
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,210
particular platform it just doesn't get

624
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,060
fixed because you have to demonstrate to

625
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,980
the manufacturer exactly they don't

626
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,150
believe you until there's like an

627
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,890
overwhelming amount of evidence or well

628
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,660
it's a lot we used to call it making the

629
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,790
theoretical practical right until you

630
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,740
can do that then nothing really changes

631
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,120
and it would like think back so if

632
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,500
you're going to let you burn your hand

633
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,570
on the stove you can tell them that it's

634
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,020
hot all day long exactly exactly so you

635
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,520
know when Windows first came out when

636
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,240
Microsoft said Windows is more secure

637
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,100
than Unix because it doesn't have all

638
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,200
those UNIX vulnerabilities like tools

639
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,450
like crack don't work and we took that

640
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,160
as a challenge at the loft and we built

641
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,590
loft crack because we said come on of

642
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,030
course you can crack Windows passwords

643
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,930
and it turned out that they were

644
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,450
actually weaker than the DES encryption

645
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,440
so like until you can actually

646
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,330
demonstrate something things don't

647
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,070
change I think that we all understand

648
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,690
that in the industry so it's I think

649
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,630
some of the work with the PLA s show

650
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,280
away what I mean leave something to

651
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,780
PLC's ok was showing that you know there

652
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,470
is significant significant problem still

653
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,970
with the infrastructure that's been

654
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,730
deployed and so these guys what they did

655
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,300
was they essentially built a a plc

656
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,790
rootkit they built something that could

657
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,920
be resident in memory and it would cut

658
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,000
the PLC's i/o so it's the connection

659
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,270
between the virtual IO port which is a

660
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,610
little memory element that is storing

661
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,850
that the the the state of the pin and

662
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,450
the actual hardware pin setting the

663
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,720
actual pin setting so the the software

664
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,390
thinks the pin setting is what it last

665
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,790
one is not a physical

666
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,480
eglantine it's connected it and and also

667
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,280
if it was to write it thinks it's

668
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,140
writing just fine but it's just writing

669
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,400
to the memory and it's actually not

670
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,790
writing to the pin so you've basically

671
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,650
isolated the software from the outside

672
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,650
world which means you know two things

673
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,060
you could run you could potentially run

674
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,710
you can't to change the state of the

675
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,060
device and nobody would be able to

676
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,970
ignore clean sound exactly and so these

677
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,830
guys they did it first on the Raspberry

678
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,870
Pi they said well the Raspberry Pi has

679
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,450
this kind of i/o hardware architecture

680
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,970
that PLC's do and raspberry PI's are

681
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,250
cheap and easy right so they did it on

682
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,960
the Raspberry Pi and they showed it and

683
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,600
they say look we have a plc rootkit and

684
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,830
the first thing people said was no you

685
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,050
have a Raspberry Pi rootkit right and

686
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,310
they said but look here the

687
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,140
documentation that uses the same chips

688
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,140
its uses the same over oh no no it's not

689
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,820
a problem with PLC's with the problem

690
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,800
with the Raspberry Pi so they had to

691
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,230
actually make make their rootkit they

692
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,000
had to order a PLC and make their

693
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,980
rootkit and demonstrate that to get the

694
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,430
manufacturers right to do something so

695
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,370
I've got a I'm curious because we've

696
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,990
been around long enough to see the

697
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,230
trajectory of a sort of exploitation and

698
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,310
fixes and so are these devices

699
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,410
constrained enough small enough that it

700
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,820
doesn't have an unlimited amount of bugs

701
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,830
a lot of these devices are small enough

702
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,440
is it possible to create hardened the

703
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,420
PLC like you can drain the swamp

704
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,250
if you hammer on it long enough or is it

705
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,110
sort of like there's just some bugs or

706
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,700
dents and you're just going to keep

707
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,850
finding them or is there a benefit to

708
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,350
this because you you go through this

709
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,690
five generations and all of a sudden

710
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,880
you've squeezed out always no I think

711
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,730
there's still a lot of bugs and also one

712
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,530
of the problems is they don't have the

713
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,470
exploit mitigation capability is that a

714
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,230
modern LS does like so even though

715
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,210
they're running less code there's still

716
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,190
vents enough because if you only do a

717
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,290
great stack overflow that kind of that

718
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,590
kind of thing and if the if the code

719
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,360
wasn't written with security in mind of

720
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,020
course there's going to be

721
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,590
vulnerabilities right right none of you

722
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,110
guys have jumped in here

723
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,659
I think there's one one exception to

724
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,000
your argument ninety-eight fellow friend

725
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,669
of ours release secret ejection then

726
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:41,340
Bernardo a sequel math which to millions

727
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,690
of kiddies around the world thought will

728
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,539
leap pwnage people we sought to fix that

729
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,000
problem so I'm wondering if the argument

730
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,409
of the tools are there people are going

731
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:50,820
to fix the problem is still valid

732
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,260
because we're still making the same

733
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,799
mistakes

734
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,380
I mean Internet of Things it's it's not

735
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,000
new bugs they near the whole idea of

736
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,340
stunt hacking now you're owning a dildo

737
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,320
connected Internet well done which is

738
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,029
still using a floor from 15 years ago

739
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:05,159
and the tools of it so I'm wondering if

740
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,830
it's not a case of it's too cheap to fix

741
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,799
but people just accept you the risk but

742
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,299
you know these your example sequel

743
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,919
injection people who want to write

744
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,840
software that sequel injection free can

745
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,120
and they do so like when's the last time

746
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,510
you heard of a major bank having a

747
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,039
sequel injection vulnerability it just

748
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,840
doesn't happen anymore for people that

749
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,110
are actually trying of course people who

750
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,610
are ready dating websites aren't trying

751
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,070
so hard it's actually kind of surprising

752
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,830
that TalkTalk didn't try because they

753
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,620
were there but you know people are still

754
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,380
affected by sequel injection because our

755
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,120
data is in all these different websites

756
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,789
out there dating sites and places that

757
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,350
don't care so people don't think about

758
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,210
it and are impacted by it but I think

759
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,909
businesses that care about it and and do

760
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:53,010
their in recourse you could you want to

761
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,990
get where on the PLT you just can't you

762
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,789
can today but hopefully at some point

763
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,830
like power companies will say we're only

764
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,779
buying PLC's that don't have this

765
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,510
problem well let's hope the ICL websites

766
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,029
ISPs use use very code to make sure that

767
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:07,710
i'll buy gold st coli i think it's a

768
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,929
great idea i think it you're gonna have

769
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:12,720
to pay me for that later okay um okay so

770
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,519
here's the part where we have people

771
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,779
with microphones in the audience i'm

772
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,019
going to open it up to some questions

773
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:20,100
anything goes it doesn't have to be on

774
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,510
these three subjects can be on anything

775
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,419
and we're happy to talk about it and if

776
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,889
we don't get any questions and we're

777
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,450
going to just keep talking amongst

778
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,279
ourselves so if you have a question

779
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,779
please stand up or raise your hand and

780
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,179
we'll get you a microphone I'm blinded

781
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,129
so I can't tell what's going on you know

782
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:40,730
okay fantastic oh hi general question

783
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,429
with the hacks that we've seen

784
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:46,879
attributed to Russia of the DNC

785
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:50,090
amongst other organizations this is

786
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,419
old-school stuff as you know as in very

787
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:57,080
simple do we what do we do about this do

788
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,999
we need to get rid of email you know any

789
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:03,769
reaction to the fact that theoretically

790
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,899
elections are being influenced by the

791
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:09,320
breach of very easy to use but easy to

792
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,779
hack tools yeah I mean one of my fears

793
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,600
with the election hacking is that is

794
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,610
even though like the voting machines

795
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,340
might be physically separated that the

796
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,960
election you know tabulation and

797
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,549
management systems where they take the

798
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:28,029
memory cards and so that those are

799
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:32,389
separated if you look at the what makes

800
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,369
up an election management system it's

801
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,499
like an Oracle database some Windows

802
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:39,529
workstations it's it's it's common

803
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:41,899
business computing stuff and that all

804
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:44,059
needs to be patched and upgraded and

805
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,830
managed and data has to be brought back

806
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,559
and forth on removable media right so I

807
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,440
think the same the same kind of you know

808
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,059
air-gap jumping that happened in in

809
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,249
Stuxnet is very possible to happen with

810
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:59,450
with election management systems and

811
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,529
that's also not that sophisticated

812
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,480
either I mean I saw it on mr. robot

813
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,990
right so easy they do well yeah and it's

814
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,139
interesting to what you said about basic

815
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:12,350
techniques I mean that's perfect mo of

816
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,940
some of these the nation-state actors

817
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,639
only use the least amount of effort

818
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:18,529
necessary to achieve your aims why

819
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,240
reveal you have a greater capability

820
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,580
when the most basic will work and keep

821
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,379
doing the most basic until it gets fixed

822
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:26,629
why why reveal anything more about your

823
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:28,429
capability and by keeping it a low level

824
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:31,190
it's more deniable look anybody can do

825
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,610
this

826
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,259
why are you you know signaling out US

827
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,249
for Russians and was it the Russians

828
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:38,779
observations Hawg yeah that's right let

829
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:39,980
you do maybe should just give up

830
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,330
you know don't bother trying to kill

831
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,830
each other and so I think what it's done

832
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,629
at least in the in the states is it's

833
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,760
made all of our jobs that

834
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,460
much more serious now they're not only

835
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,080
they're going to turn to us on fixing

836
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,520
the database now they're going to be

837
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,350
asking us to help fix election systems

838
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,180
things that underpin our societies and

839
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,890
so the spotlight has never been on our

840
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,870
community to agree to degree than right

841
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,410
now

842
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,870
it used to be that we would talk about

843
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,760
oh if only the boards and CEOs would ask

844
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,380
our opinion we would just tell them how

845
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,210
it is and it fix everything well now

846
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,730
you've got policy people asking us and

847
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,220
so I think that's to me whether it

848
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,660
influences the election or not there's a

849
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,670
thousand people talking about that it's

850
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,710
about what what do how do we respond to

851
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,320
it as a community and how do we prevent

852
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,340
this in the future

853
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,860
I mean election systems are never going

854
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,290
to be as secure as an ATM and hey Tina

855
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,120
Clark Community are breaking in to all

856
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,780
the time

857
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,790
so I don't I don't hold out much hope on

858
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,300
the technology side another question or

859
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,020
I'm sorry I cut any of you guys off you

860
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,960
okay over here I want to to return back

861
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,900
a little bit to the PLC and industrial

862
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,700
controls in general because I think

863
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,970
there's a difference there between other

864
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,910
types of systems because PLC's have such

865
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,520
a long life in I mean you mentioned

866
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,620
eight years ago we started eight years

867
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,470
ago to look into their security you are

868
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,100
only have to the life of PLC deployed in

869
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,440
a factory how do we solve that problem

870
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,240
because let's think about it if we

871
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,540
create PLC's now with new defenses new

872
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,540
mitigations and so forth can we say that

873
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,730
they won't be vulnerable to something 10

874
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,890
years from now some new techniques that

875
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,710
we will be developed in the meantime how

876
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,270
do we solve that problem you know we

877
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,700
create let me memorize the summarized

878
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,500
question for people couldn't hear it

879
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,040
so it's essentially PLC's are different

880
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,230
than normal computing devices because

881
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,540
they have such a long life span eight

882
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,630
years ten years plus and we see this now

883
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,740
starting with the Internet of Things

884
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,840
it's like the long tail problem I've

885
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,550
heard it in Washington DC referred to as

886
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,680
the latter problem where you actually

887
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,840
need to get a ladder out to get to the

888
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,320
device to try to fix it and so by show

889
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,000
of hands here how many people have

890
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,610
replaced their phone in the last three

891
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,950
years it

892
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,420
how many people have replaced your smoke

893
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,400
detector in the last three years

894
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,130
right the average lifespan of a smoke

895
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,949
detector is about a decade and the cost

896
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,600
of replacing some of these things are

897
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,820
greater than the cost of the thing and

898
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,460
so in the long tail on these PLC's are

899
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,139
15 years what do we do

900
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,690
15 years I've heard I have one customer

901
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,909
that makes industrial systems and they

902
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,679
said they have products that they sold

903
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,290
50 years ago that are still in operation

904
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,510
and power plants that have I thought

905
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,429
capacitors broke down after that amount

906
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,480
of time I don't know but maybe that's

907
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,830
exaggeration but it's way more than 10

908
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,719
years it's clearly 20 or 30 year

909
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,090
lifetime on on a lot of this stuff I

910
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,710
mean look at you know airplanes right

911
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,929
they have like a 30-year lifetime so

912
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,120
whenever you put you know computers into

913
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,969
devices you're you're extending the life

914
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,030
life that that system has to be secure

915
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,630
very far into the future so I think you

916
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,390
know that the solution one of the major

917
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,520
parts of that solution is you need to

918
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,680
have a secure updating mechanism yeah

919
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,510
where you can securely update like the

920
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,000
device typically not always but

921
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,740
typically can only be hacked if it is

922
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,390
connected to a network so use that

923
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,570
capability to make the device updatable

924
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,370
but there's so many devices out there

925
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,320
that just aren't updatable I mean in the

926
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,240
industrial control system space you hear

927
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,210
of bugs really critical bugs being found

928
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,010
like there's like a hard-coded password

929
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,620
and the manufacturer says like we don't

930
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,820
support that and there's no way to

931
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,310
update it yeah so and now you decide

932
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,290
violate the systems from the internet

933
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,700
kind of like a solution Google with

934
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,520
their older Android devices like a

935
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,280
two-year-old Google yeah we've come

936
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,290
across plenty of boxes well especially

937
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,950
in heavy industry running women 311

938
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,540
still works don't turn it off please

939
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,550
don't take the plug out that's right but

940
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,740
how do you update it you know most

941
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,240
people today wouldn't recognize windows

942
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,640
311 but it's doing this job with other

943
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,480
24/7

944
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
it just works yeah isolation

945
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,470
vulnerabilities clean as hell and I've

946
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,120
heard of I'm curious on your take on

947
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,440
this I've heard of some people they I've

948
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,930
heard two answers one is you need to

949
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,270
update and if you need to update all I

950
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,180
hear is a giant PKI which scares me a

951
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,620
little bit because if your manufacturer

952
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,890
loses their key

953
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,230
or in 15 years there's a change anyone

954
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,970
can update it anybody can update it so I

955
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,610
mean it's better than nothing but now

956
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,410
they now every manufacturer has to be a

957
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,470
PKI master yet so I said secure update

958
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,390
and kind of gloss over oh yeah all right

959
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,770
that sounds super scary but then the

960
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,230
other one is like on the latest giant

961
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,640
denial service attack when there were

962
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,990
these IP cameras people have been

963
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,510
talking about Oh a rate limit so even if

964
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,280
the machines are compromised they can

965
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,350
only do a limited amount of harm but

966
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,180
that doesn't help you in this PLC case

967
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,870
because the harm is in making the device

968
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,710
malfunction not in denial of service

969
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,900
right yeah I think we have to explore

970
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,230
the thing of like restricting what the

971
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,480
device can do you know how to what it

972
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,550
was designed to do do you not but I

973
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,020
don't have a good answer but I think

974
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,520
that's a that is a sort of a path

975
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,270
forward here

976
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,560
do you remember and back in the days

977
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,170
building your own PC and if you want to

978
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,550
do a flash update you used to have to

979
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,580
put a physical jumper reflash and old

980
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,410
scuzzy drives had a physical Hardware

981
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,130
write-protect

982
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,830
thing like would it be nice if the PLC's

983
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,080
like have a hardware write-protect

984
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,430
yeah we get that we've got the software

985
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,840
loaded but the hardware drive minute

986
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,750
fixed right but somebody removed those

987
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,070
pins because it saved them half a penny

988
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,220
and now we have no protection or with

989
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,930
customer support calls I can't update my

990
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,500
software

991
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,750
yeah boxes remove the jumper yeah I'm

992
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,040
wondering if we're going to see a

993
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,860
resurgence of these sort of physical

994
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,000
protections because we realized the

995
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,730
software protections are not cutting it

996
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,500
there's a business one more question

997
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,140
over here I think something that's

998
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,490
interesting over the last couple years

999
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,860
is we're seeing more and more kind of

1000
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,800
hardware exploits which are not bugs and

1001
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,560
the hardware per se the design working

1002
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,540
is intended but that introducing new

1003
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,760
vulnerabilities I'm thinking about

1004
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
things like row hammer and cache timing

1005
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,140
vulnerabilities and so forth do you

1006
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,180
think we need to start thinking about

1007
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,640
more drastic changes to how we manage

1008
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,590
the hardware and the way that we do with

1009
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,540
operating systems like active

1010
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,180
mitigations and active monitoring and so

1011
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,680
forth and the hardware and the ability

1012
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,590
to actually you know patch hardware at

1013
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,680
charge well well I know some of the

1014
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,930
people at the Intel security team their

1015
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,880
whole vision is bacon security into the

1016
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,500
now whether it's done accurately or not

1017
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,540
but if you see some of the new CPU and

1018
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,760
memory protections you can see this is

1019
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,980
clearly the road Intel is going down I

1020
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,720
don't know about you're the expert on

1021
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,400
well I think that that's good I think

1022
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,900
that there there's some limitations

1023
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,910
there but I think the you know the

1024
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,630
hardware being aware of some security

1025
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,609
properties of the system and sort of

1026
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,000
monitoring that is something important

1027
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,530
I'm always curious on when your

1028
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,839
provision cloud and your rebooting and

1029
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,400
refreshing I guess the device in the

1030
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,760
cloud you know are they reflashing the

1031
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,770
video and the network and the like does

1032
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,480
everything get cleanly reflash when you

1033
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,910
reprovision a cloud server I don't think

1034
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,380
so well you can't jump out of the

1035
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,609
virtual machine so where you worry

1036
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:18,339
little bit but yeah I think the hardware

1037
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,359
things interesting if you look at

1038
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,990
Samsung's recent marketing hooha with

1039
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,200
the note 7 after other Joburg the other

1040
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,670
week and they had a gentleman there

1041
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,980
whose sole job was to swap out the

1042
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,930
hardware we go through the plane so like

1043
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,460
you late you fly with you next and at

1044
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,900
the gate you're planing takes your note

1045
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,670
11 you get a note so you given your note

1046
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,109
7 I don't know how they do the backup

1047
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,819
type thing you get some other Samsung

1048
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,170
phone and that's the problem with

1049
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,150
Hardware how do you swap it out and if

1050
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,799
you can't update it to somebody walk

1051
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,329
around drive around the logistics of

1052
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,010
physically swapping out hardware is

1053
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,670
really really hard

1054
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,710
yeah it's the latter problem how do you

1055
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,299
find it all I mean once it's installed

1056
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,220
and then you change jobs and five years

1057
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,660
later somebody has to find your embedded

1058
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,940
Wireless hang in the building you're

1059
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,700
never going to find it again no I think

1060
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,770
we have time for one more question okay

1061
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,760
thank you

1062
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,059
and so I have a question or I want to

1063
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:09,730
hear your thoughts about what I think we

1064
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,950
are doing something wrong as industry

1065
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,599
professionals because we have been

1066
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,530
talking for example telling people for

1067
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,650
many many many many years

1068
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,839
please look up please take care of your

1069
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,109
data editor secure in stuff and it took

1070
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,960
ransomware TVL to actually people start

1071
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,540
getting our backups and checking that

1072
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,420
the backups who actually worked and it

1073
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,690
took not somewhere to make normal people

1074
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,470
to actually verify that

1075
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,440
so I think that for I feel that for the

1076
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,180
last ten years that's kind of a waste of

1077
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,680
time or we are doing something wrong

1078
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,140
because if our message is not kind of

1079
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,900
getting there right right but do you

1080
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,760
think of that originally for a brief

1081
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,130
period in time I thought that end user

1082
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,470
education was the key and now I've given

1083
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,730
up on it I mean I you know stop think

1084
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,760
connect or whatever some one of the

1085
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,800
logos in the United States to try to

1086
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,420
raise security awareness I just I don't

1087
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,599
think that's going to work I love views

1088
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,940
like the fish meat type services to try

1089
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,069
to educate you I love that but I don't

1090
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:21,210
think in the end it's going to really

1091
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,280
make much of a difference like my mom

1092
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,170
should not be a computer security expert

1093
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,690
to use her computer she should assume

1094
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,790
like when she gets in a car highly

1095
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,740
technical sophisticated piece of

1096
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,349
machinery she just assumes it's going to

1097
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:36,000
work he's purchased it she's consumer

1098
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,119
the computer should be safe and I think

1099
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,589
that's the kind of environment we should

1100
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:43,440
be striving for not teaching you like

1101
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,819
everything else in life works one way

1102
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:47,069
but when you get near a computer it's

1103
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,200
completely different I don't know if

1104
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,940
that's unrealistic in my thinking but

1105
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,050
that's where I haven't gone other I

1106
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,480
think that you know that's that's the I

1107
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
actually learned when I gave a talk in

1108
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,859
in Chile that the word for security and

1109
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,280
safety is the same in Spanish and so I

1110
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,589
think we need to do think more like like

1111
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,329
these systems have to be safe which

1112
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,980
means you don't have to be an expert to

1113
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,119
operate it safely

1114
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,800
like there's equipment that you have to

1115
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,569
be trained in and you have to do

1116
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:14,280
everything exactly right or you like

1117
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,980
lose a limb right like like there's

1118
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,210
equipment like that out there in the

1119
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,250
real world that's not safe equipment but

1120
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,260
the consumer equipment is very safe

1121
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,109
because of liability and the expectation

1122
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,359
that even a young child might have got

1123
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,740
their hands on it if their hands on it

1124
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,960
so I think that's how we have to think

1125
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,240
about you know computer technology you

1126
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,829
almost need like a in the UK up the kite

1127
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:36,450
logo that means it's been tested a

1128
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,670
toaster I touched the toaster I don't

1129
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,920
want to get shot that's really basic you

1130
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,990
know it's early morning and not awake we

1131
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,150
use the same to the device and we were

1132
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,650
talking about it with our phones right

1133
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,720
now you buy an iPhone or a Google pixel

1134
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,240
and you accept that you're paying 800

1135
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,380
pounds or whatever you almost need

1136
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,350
a food standards type thing this phone

1137
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,810
does this send this data out to these

1138
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,550
places so you're more aware like okay

1139
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,780
you know what you're buying you know he

1140
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,860
won yeah I'm really curious on the

1141
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,440
acceptance of risk I guess and expecting

1142
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,330
my mom to know all the risks he's

1143
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,520
accepting when she clicks on a lane what

1144
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,520
is unrealistic and so I think we should

1145
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,800
approach it in a different maybe more

1146
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,080
simplified way and we I think what's

1147
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,100
going to happen is you touch on the

1148
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,840
viability I think what's going to happen

1149
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,420
with Internet of Things all of this

1150
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,610
computing infrastructure cars PLC's is

1151
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,200
the arm's distance from the average

1152
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,450
consumer to them the closest they get to

1153
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,040
the technology is maybe the iPhone I

1154
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,420
mean a phone in their hands where

1155
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,220
they're interacting or maybe a laptop

1156
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,380
now within and of things it's going to

1157
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,540
be in there it's going to be everywhere

1158
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,860
and when those things start

1159
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,690
malfunctioning and start causing harm I

1160
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,070
don't think the consumers are going to

1161
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,500
be down with the shrink-wrap software

1162
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,210
license and you know being told that

1163
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,620
they accept the risk of this internet

1164
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,910
toaster burning down their house and

1165
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,280
that's the difference is the technology

1166
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,990
is not at arm's distance it's

1167
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,750
intertwined with their life now and

1168
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,640
that's I think going to be another huge

1169
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,130
challenge for us as a community because

1170
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,420
soon as those toasters start burning

1171
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,420
down houses we're going to have to start

1172
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,370
explaining it and legislators government

1173
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,690
is going to want to quote-unquote solve

1174
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,690
the problem and if industry can't solve

1175
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,700
it which uncomfort I don't think they

1176
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,880
can because it you know bullets out of

1177
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,700
the gun so to speak that means we're

1178
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,720
going to have to learn when we get

1179
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,570
touched the hot plate and that's really

1180
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,740
doom and gloom because I don't like

1181
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,110
regulation but you know correct me if

1182
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,130
I'm wrong do you think that's the road

1183
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,900
we're going down I think we're heading

1184
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,100
that way and I think it's inevitable we

1185
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,780
kind of failed as an industry we

1186
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,510
struggled to build secure stable safe

1187
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,150
things you know given a good chance but

1188
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,680
need some kind of pick up the else oh it

1189
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,780
was it on the kick up the answer I worry

1190
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,310
about the same thing like with medical

1191
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,750
equipment do we need someone to die

1192
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,410
because of ransomware right and and so I

1193
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,270
think things would improve if someone

1194
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,760
died but that's a horrible so player why

1195
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,140
do we have to learn that way through

1196
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,960
society yeah okay well thanks very much

1197
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,040
we're going to be around for a little

1198
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,740
bit I want to

1199
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,060
