1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,920
so I'm Christopher Alberg I'm the

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
co-founder and CEO recorded future and

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,279
I'm going to talk about what I call

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,069
chasing foxes by the numbers probably

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,500
more specifically thinking about as

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
patterns of life and how we can do this

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,660
in what I will very liberally call

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,270
hacker forums so we will start sort of

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,789
in the in the world of attribution most

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,680
of you in this room probably know

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,340
exactly what that is I live in the u.s.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,750
I'm Swedish by background but I live in

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,820
the US and funnily enough now in the

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,559
election that's going on sort of

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,200
attribution has become like one of the

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,969
top subjects of everything it's sort of

17
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,070
like it was the Russians who did it or

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,100
there was a 400-pound guy in a basement

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,289
in Oregon who did it and you know all of

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,020
that stuff now a lot of attribution if

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,640
we dig into all these sort of fancy

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,100
reports that get published as many times

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,620
or many times it's done based on what I

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,440
would call sloppy handle usage so we

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,559
dive into the mandiant report a51 report

26
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,930
and you know ugly gorilla sort of being

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,549
all over the internet if you want or

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,060
super hard or green sky 27c pyy so on

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,799
and so forth and we sort of we I'll just

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,110
use the CP YY example here you know

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,390
somebody does a domain registration the

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,610
user handle they they keep using that

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,340
handle sort of across the board they use

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,470
it in social media forums or they might

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,560
use it at a you know email site some

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,140
deaf forum and sometimes this is it for

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,970
a reason some of the Russian criminals

38
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,710
will do this actually for really

39
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,200
building out sort of a you know

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,700
reputation if you want that it's in

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,979
necessary for them others do it because

42
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,229
they're sloppy others do it for other

43
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,030
sort of reasons maybe just to sort of

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,970
stand out now what we're going to talk

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,390
about today is what do we do when our

46
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,149
actors who we'll call them that apply

47
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,090
some better OPSEC to things and and they

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,460
actually do what I like to refer to as

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,350
handle hopping sort of thing but in the

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,210
world of radio where people might do

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,520
radio frequency hopping so what about if

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,770
people change handles this becomes hard

53
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,538
you know then we don't have that benefit

54
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,520
of chasing a handle so how do we then

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,620
target find out what forums

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,420
the target how do we figure out what are

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,640
the key handles to sort of focus in on

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,769
and most importantly maybe how do we

59
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,930
deal with handle hopping within a forum

60
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,989
or across Forbes probably found crews

61
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,700
have handles and so on I'm going to try

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,560
to see if we can apply some app today

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
we're going to geek it out a little bit

64
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,010
hopefully not too much of intimidating

65
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,690
math I might intimidate myself actually

66
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,329
by doing that but the way that we're

67
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,950
going to think about this is in terms of

68
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,200
pattern is of pattern of life analysis

69
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,909
and those of you sort of have a

70
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,989
background in criminal background or you

71
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,150
know criminal investigations or in

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,099
counterterrorism and so on probably have

73
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,810
heard this word and and if you haven't

74
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,280
you know I'll sort of take you through

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,840
it so we're going to start off by

76
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,879
looking at some generic sort of pattern

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,239
of life analysis and then dive into this

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,980
world of hacking forms and try to apply

79
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,040
that so I'll start with this example I

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,590
don't know anybody have seen this before

81
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,379
this is on the uber blog made it's sort

82
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,120
of a fun example I hope it's fun let's

83
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,640
see on the uber blog maybe year and a

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,200
half ago or something like that they had

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,790
they had to take it down enough sort of

86
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,459
what makes it fun and they they looked

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,940
at rides at uber took this sort of the

88
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,169
whole data set somebody's taking

89
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,450
pictures on that's good and they took

90
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,419
the data set and look for rides that

91
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,810
started at 1:00 a.m. went to a house and

92
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,940
then had another car picked them up at

93
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,680
5:00 a.m. and you can sort of imagine

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,720
this is sort of they call them rides of

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,090
glory and you know they ended up in a

96
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,530
lot of hot water for this but the

97
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,690
interesting sort of thing was by looking

98
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,370
at a large data set in this case San

99
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,040
Francisco they could identify hot areas

100
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,829
where you actually might sort of end up

101
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,090
in this sort of ride and they because

102
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,970
I'll go across time and find out when

103
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,650
this would happen and no surprise

104
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,389
Valentine's Day in the u.s. is a

105
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,220
terrible time to actually end up in this

106
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,459
situation versus tax day being a great

107
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,500
one so you're sort of looking at

108
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,139
large-scale so you know tax day in I

109
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,579
don't remember with this district this

110
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,730
is sort of great great time to go out so

111
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,289
I think that's sort of fun

112
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,149
and we look at a more serious example

113
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,608
this is it's looking at crime in Chicago

114
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,550
on a 24-hour cycle the other one was

115
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,750
sort of looking across the whole year

116
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,480
this is a 24-hour cycle and

117
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,310
at the top level we have a panel here I

118
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,810
hope you can see it's sort of a towards

119
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,430
the back but a panel that basically

120
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,110
shows that criminals actually go to

121
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,520
sleep in the middle of the night you

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,600
know like anybody else and we're

123
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,880
actually to come back to that pattern

124
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,890
take it apart and look at crime you can

125
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,200
see that burglaries sort of surprising

126
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,970
that was surprising to me they peak at

127
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,500
9:00 a.m. in the morning and you know

128
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,610
when people have just left their houses

129
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,740
actually I thought it would be later but

130
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,600
that was sort of interesting kidnappings

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,310
this is sort of depressing 9:00 a.m. and

132
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,370
3:00 p.m. you know drop off we kick and

133
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,530
pick up in schools you know that's sort

134
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,050
of depressing narcotics is sort of

135
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,430
interesting you know people get high at

136
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,200
night but then we have this sort of

137
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,900
lunch I'm gonna try to know anybody in

138
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,840
this room yeah and and you know the last

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,640
example that is sort of depressing too

140
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,130
we got the sort of hpm for for

141
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,810
prostitution and I'm like yeah that's

142
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,520
sort of early but then we got the 7 a.m.

143
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,900
that I can't explain that

144
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,260
so whoo rapidly go on and now for those

145
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,820
of you who have worked in

146
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,040
counterterrorism and so on and been

147
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
doing this sort of stuff then you really

148
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,040
do get into sort of when you try to take

149
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
this to a different level attract

150
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,460
individuals and really look at

151
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,050
developing a pattern life that you can

152
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,300
use for you know arresting somebody or

153
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,220
or whatever you're doing this is a great

154
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,330
figure out of a book called

155
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,070
activity-based intelligence that you can

156
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,260
pick up and so you can sort of do this

157
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,320
at a high level all the way down to

158
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,010
pretty specific

159
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,260
now these example are so nice and it's

160
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,330
all clean and so on and if you've ever

161
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,920
done this this is more of what it feels

162
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,690
like you know this is Carrie's wall in

163
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,990
homeland it's not you know it's very

164
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,730
unrealistic in many ways primarily

165
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,430
because she has all kinds of top-secret

166
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,590
data at home which you know usually not

167
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,870
a good idea and but you know it's

168
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,420
interesting if you remember this TV

169
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,010
thing here for example you have that gap

170
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,010
here when they have no date on the guy

171
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,930
that's probably not a terrible sort of

172
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,490
like this idea being even and something

173
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,440
crazy like this you can see pattern

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,420
somewhere will sort of look to that so

175
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,640
now we're going to deal with these

176
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,620
hacker forums and I've picked pictures

177
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,810
here to make it a scary forum stuff you

178
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,620
know if you can imagine and it's hairy

179
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,120
because you know these things they move

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,830
around and they come and go and they're

181
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,080
in you know Russian and Arabic and farsi

182
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,300
and Chinese and you know

183
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,060
tricky stuff so what we do at recorder

184
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,130
future is that we collect on this stuff

185
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,680
you know the views Intel terms so we run

186
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,990
automated collection as much as we can

187
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,700
and then overlay some human element to

188
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
it we've done this sort of ongoingly

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,260
over last four years if you want across

190
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,930
a wide set of not very liberally call it

191
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,760
hacker forums you've got carding forums

192
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,380
and you know very scamming stuff where

193
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,350
you're all kinds of stuff here seven

194
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,240
languages it's all indexed and maybe

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,130
most importantly who do a lot of natural

196
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,080
language processing on this so that we

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,670
can extract features so one of the

198
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,680
things we'll look at today is looking

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,230
for people talking about CVEs and

200
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,570
exploits that will use some sort of an

201
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,430
indication to understand what the guys

202
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,130
in the forum or probably most guys but

203
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,230
mostly guys for the people in the forum

204
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,880
are actually interested in so once we do

205
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,340
that now we can start looking at things

206
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,990
so the first thing so out of this

207
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,090
dataset wind up would have one point

208
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,030
four million handles lots of leet-speak

209
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,530
there if you think about it a lot of

210
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,840
variations in handles because you know

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,670
another took eight nine characters long

212
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,040
so it's a lot of variation so because it

213
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,800
turns out that 90% of them are only used

214
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,650
once so pretty unique pretty amazing

215
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,030
actually if you if you think about it

216
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,120
and so I wanted to do some distribution

217
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,010
picture of that but but that in itself

218
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,090
is sort of interesting we're going to

219
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,580
come back to that so first you look at

220
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,290
the first pattern across all of these

221
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,090
forums and this look at when is the

222
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,370
activity and it actually looks very

223
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,190
similar to our sort of crime in Chicago

224
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,320
same thing here even you know we're

225
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,640
sitting here with a bunch of smart

226
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,060
hacker type people in the room even we

227
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,760
or you have to sleep you know sort of

228
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,590
baseline so I found that interesting

229
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,180
and now the temporal patterns over the

230
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,970
24 cycle just differ so this is just

231
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,460
taking 16 of them from Chinese forms

232
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,640
Iran informs Russian forms and there are

233
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,559
different patterns here you know you see

234
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,000
that looks interesting Corey's going to

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,530
hey shoo a chinese packer form this one

236
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,039
now-defunct

237
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,510
or actually over the last couple of

238
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,750
weeks defunct the it has sort of a

239
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,660
morning and an afternoon cycle and is

240
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,070
this the lunch cycle

241
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,590
you know we could argue about that I

242
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,000
like lunch maybe these guys like lunch

243
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,060
too and the here is another one

244
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,430
Russian forum this looks different it

245
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,930
sort of keeps going through the day

246
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,370
maybe here we're talking about two

247
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,230
geographies maybe this is the blood of

248
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,780
austell crew and the moscow crew to be a

249
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,450
little bit simplistic could be it could

250
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,770
be other stuff could be one crew one

251
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,130
another crew comes on later and we can

252
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,110
look at this across the years these are

253
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,700
looking at some prominent forum sexual

254
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,580
oen and jean mia from iran and then

255
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,470
another arabic forum there's sort of

256
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,730
interesting if you look at activity

257
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,560
across the year so here

258
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,990
Jean yeah the the web very well-known

259
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,400
Iranian we'll call it hacker forum sort

260
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,380
of low point at the anniversary of the

261
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,240
Islamic Revolution so get off their

262
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,010
computers this one was interesting the

263
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,650
Arabic one sort of peeking at Ramadan so

264
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,450
at least asking around of my friends

265
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,830
sort of from that part of the world

266
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,210
they're saying like not a lot of other

267
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,640
stuff to do and you know at that time

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,560
and then you know everybody gets the

269
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,940
party at the end of the year maybe or

270
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,190
you know so New Year's the low point as

271
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,910
well yeah just did your thing so now

272
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,200
we're going to look at shorter

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,270
timeframes sort of weekly weeks and days

274
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,370
that's I think we can sort of find the

275
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,690
most interesting stuff so this is

276
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,670
looking at all of our data it actually

277
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,050
turns out that Sundays and Saturdays

278
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,240
even guys in front of the computer do

279
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,190
get a break in the weekend so that was

280
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,650
maybe interesting when we compare that

281
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,660
to this Iranian forum where we see

282
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,060
Sundays and Saturdays having lots of

283
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,560
traffic make sense with you know they

284
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,270
work hard in Iran it supported 4-hour

285
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,160
workweek I think and it's half of

286
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,410
Thursday and Friday that's all versus

287
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,480
and so they work in the weekend but the

288
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,280
Wednesday what's going on here that's

289
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,470
interesting we're going to come back to

290
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,510
that so the way that I think about this

291
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,670
is can we look at these forums and try

292
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,160
to see how they respond to external

293
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,890
events a little bit like why in this

294
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,410
room now scream out like there's a new

295
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,210
flash exploit out you know you guys are

296
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,470
going to be like you know I don't know

297
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,820
that sounds like actually pretty boring

298
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,260
but you know maybe I'll get a little bit

299
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,550
of reaction worried if I go in the

300
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,590
street and say that you know people are

301
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,850
gonna be like who is that lunatic you

302
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,770
know so you can look at how people

303
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,860
respond to things so here is sort of

304
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,260
interesting looking at exports I am

305
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,460
again well known Russian

306
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,560
and no Saturdays and Sundays so general

307
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,650
traffic but then we look at post

308
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,360
Tuesday's where there's been patched

309
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,270
Tuesdays sort of tribe stuff going on so

310
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,020
suddenly peak in activity regarding CDEs

311
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,940
so where people are talking about seedy

312
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,560
so it's actually the sort of good old

313
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,750
Patch Tuesday pattern people have seen

314
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,390
for the longest of time still it's

315
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,970
active this was late last year so so

316
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,320
sort of interesting so you can look at

317
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,360
you know how they react to this outside

318
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,910
pattern and actually comparing the

319
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,610
Iranian forum our Johnny here to explode

320
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,820
am we get the same so same reaction on

321
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,310
Wednesdays even though we see distinctly

322
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,680
different for example weekend patterns

323
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,260
here so pretty neat we can sort of get a

324
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,000
sense here that these probably are

325
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,920
people that are interested in exploits

326
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,050
and these sort of things that helps us

327
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,730
profile you won't see this pattern for

328
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,740
example if you go to karting forum so

329
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,940
it's you know quite different I should

330
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,500
have had that it's an example probably

331
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,970
so sort of sort of interesting so now am

332
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,320
let's compare these two though and look

333
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,980
at their work hours so here's the

334
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,110
iranian very active during the day

335
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,570
during daytime whereas the russians

336
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,120
night time and turns out that tehran to

337
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,850
moscow is only 30 hours 30 minutes of

338
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,630
change in timezone surprised me actually

339
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,480
but so this is a daytime crew you know

340
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,310
we might talk about university students

341
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,990
we might talk about you know government

342
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,670
employees who knows let's assume that

343
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,620
it's university students that are sort

344
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,410
of being nurtured and where these guys

345
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,480
seem to have a day job and then go home

346
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,450
and do their stuff at nighttime so sort

347
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,200
of interesting and so we'll dive into

348
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,660
the iranian poram and and here we see

349
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,450
now and basically when we look at

350
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,400
vulnerabilities we have q what i'll call

351
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,410
them the kings of ulnar abilities crisis

352
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,740
and hassan 2002 are our guys here stand

353
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,370
out and now to be able to sort of

354
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,870
understand this at a different level

355
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,190
we're going to dive in and we're going

356
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,650
to do what I'll apply it called some

357
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,370
clustering math here and and instead of

358
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,680
trying to look across time twenty eleven

359
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,080
twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen with

360
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,899
ten of that data to locate it in terms

361
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,250
of Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

362
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,910
Friday and then we return each day into

363
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,330
four hour blocks of so six hours six

364
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,339
blocks or four hours like a late night

365
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,070
shift and early morning and then try to

366
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,589
see if we now can look at similarities

367
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:43,390
in profiles basically this I won't try

368
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,980
to go into all the details here but they

369
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,620
imagine that if I can see two patterns

370
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,320
that are moving in sync that might tell

371
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,120
me that it might be the same guy or it

372
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,560
might be two people are active at the

373
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,839
same time whereas if their profile is

374
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,640
sort of distinctly different that might

375
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,500
tell me that you know there probably are

376
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,940
somebody very different it turns out

377
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,800
that you might imagine that this is easy

378
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,450
to fake it's pretty hard to fake this

379
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,370
stuff even though especially over long

380
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,810
periods of time we can talk about that

381
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,180
separately but and so this is going to

382
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,300
allow us to do sort of swimlanes of this

383
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,970
or heat maps if you want to cluster and

384
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,120
find patter or handles that are similar

385
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,970
we're going to be able to find handles

386
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,720
that are distinctly similar in this case

387
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,360
we're looking at two handles in the

388
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,730
Ajanta forum that are remarkably similar

389
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,760
they turn out like over here compared to

390
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,120
1.4 million other handles so the map

391
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,279
actually does some pretty cool wonders

392
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,070
for us here in a in a nice way so cool

393
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,279
all right

394
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,160
so here's a very net what I want to call

395
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,470
it non nefarious example I should say

396
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,660
that not various so just somebody who's

397
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,360
in these forums telling some sort of IT

398
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,060
product of some sort so just again non

399
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,190
nefarious then this Hamada Badr

400
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,930
and and I'm using that because it's

401
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,000
somebody who is not handle hopping but

402
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,589
they're actually using the same handle

403
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,510
across a bunch of these hacker forums

404
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,820
and at the bottom we're seeing them from

405
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,360
2013 all the way over to end of into

406
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,579
2016 I guess and we can see how they

407
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:18,130
start in Gaza hacker calm come on all

408
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,470
Yosh and then sort of adds a set of

409
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,089
forums that they're active in and then

410
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,949
up here we can sort of see their weekly

411
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:27,399
pattern and something pretty neat so now

412
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,959
this is again I picked this because this

413
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,420
is a simple simple an example where

414
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,089
somebody's not handle hopping

415
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,539
so so alright so let's see if we can

416
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,699
find some nefarious stuff so here's our

417
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,119
huts on 20 and so we look at him now and

418
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:45,209
remember this was the guys were the

419
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,919
kings of vulnerabilities that I talked

420
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,799
about before now when we cluster this it

421
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,379
turns out that Hasan 20 in crisis end up

422
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,489
next to each other

423
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:57,809
boom and we see how Hassan 20 is active

424
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,089
and literally on the day that that

425
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,089
handle stops being used crisis turns up

426
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,389
and gets active so you know very strong

427
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,879
indication here of Hassan 20 you know

428
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,879
hopping to to crisis they're using you

429
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,039
know just switching handles this is

430
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,449
again what it may be a little bit of a

431
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,949
you know too strong of an example but

432
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:18,299
it's nice you know and it shows that

433
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,849
it's hard to get away so you know the

434
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,139
better for worse I'm sure there's some

435
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,689
some challenges on that but it's hard to

436
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,609
get away from from activity you know to

437
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:30,089
fool this so now we can then you know

438
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,939
crazy sort of heat maps and organize our

439
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,419
handles these are from the Iranian forum

440
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:39,269
we cannot only our guy Hassan but we can

441
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,149
or correct crisis we can find you know

442
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,359
that he's close to 20 in crisis but we

443
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:47,639
can then start finding hang around so

444
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,169
which could be again there could be

445
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:51,149
other handles used by the same character

446
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,279
or hang around and now we can indicate

447
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,259
use that as a way to sort of dig in and

448
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,149
look at the forum post and get the sense

449
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,069
of like is this a crew of some sort and

450
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,499
we're going to come back to that and we

451
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:03,929
can find user pods that are sort of has

452
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,230
the same behavior across the whole set

453
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,179
we can use it to dive in and see what

454
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,398
these pods are interested in so last

455
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,259
year we blogged about in this forum

456
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,398
people who are interested in various

457
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:16,740
sort of rats are associated with Android

458
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,079
and so now it then I use this as an

459
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,029
opportunity to find the set of handles

460
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:22,919
who was actually interested in that and

461
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,019
so to find the pod who was interested in

462
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:27,118
Android rat so you know which could be

463
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:29,220
pretty handed depending on what you're

464
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,850
doing and and finally we can take

465
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,710
somebody like the admin of this so and

466
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,509
he's not a secret is very well known out

467
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:37,830
there it's a bruise ice

468
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,559
he's on Instagram and he's on Iranian TV

469
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,179
and so on and sort of known as the guy

470
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,179
who nourished this forum but now we can

471
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,440
take this guy

472
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,029
and find another so I ran these 1.4

473
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,039
million handles and said who is the most

474
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,889
similar to him as I get this Mohamed

475
00:17:55,889 --> 00:18:00,330
Mohamud aaaa on BB Iran next door handle

476
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,860
which turns out to be very strongly

477
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,919
correlated and now we dive in and see

478
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,789
how his activity in Chania is all about

479
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,679
sort of reverse engineering courses in

480
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,269
this sort of stuff but then we see this

481
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:14,100
activity in this other forum where he's

482
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,649
selling web hosting services and so on

483
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,240
so you're likely running a little side

484
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,100
business here and doing something else

485
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,720
you know nothing bad but you know it's

486
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,419
interesting so how you can how you can

487
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:29,039
do this cool so now that was sort of all

488
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,750
in what you would probably call clear

489
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,399
web forums you know there there might be

490
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,200
behind passwords or you know you need

491
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,730
some some sort of login of sorts but

492
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,860
it's still sort of in clear web so let's

493
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,509
look at a couple of you know dark web

494
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,639
stuff so Turin the beauty of this is

495
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,440
that it works perfectly well doing it

496
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,360
there as well so now we're looking at

497
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,759
some wonderful guy called oxy monster on

498
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,529
dream market some of you guys probably

499
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,690
have a dream market one of these

500
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,129
wonderful places where you buy and sell

501
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,529
all kinds of crap this oxy monster he's

502
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,240
selling exactly what you would you might

503
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,879
imagine and so now we can dive in and

504
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:06,179
find other handles selling similar stuff

505
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,789
it turns out and and you know I called

506
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,470
him the Wednesday night guy here because

507
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,539
that's sort of his his profile and you

508
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,100
know again it's important and I'll come

509
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,840
say this in my conclusion - these are

510
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,419
leads or indications of somebody that

511
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,340
might be the same you know there's no

512
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,139
guarantee that all these handles is the

513
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:23,820
same guy of course you know these are

514
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,009
lead generation or you know get getting

515
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,289
you're sort of you know leads there's

516
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,230
the word we'll call it and here's

517
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,649
another example this was well known last

518
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,649
year wonderful here in London London

519
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:39,870
Underground cocaine tour that was run

520
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,629
for a while and we take the admin of

521
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:46,110
this this wonderful place and then we

522
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,259
find other sort of profiles it actually

523
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,210
turns out that he's open about the fact

524
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,740
that he's selling on nucleus and alpha

525
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,960
Bay and other sort of alpha Bay is still

526
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,419
active out there as a nice forum we're

527
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,940
nice not so nice whatever and and so

528
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,240
again

529
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,360
and we can find you know this admin

530
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,679
potentially other sort of handled says

531
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,150
he's being active up there's in this

532
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,890
case you know do doing a criminal

533
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,660
investigation on this guy this turns out

534
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,330
to be pretty pretty handy this is all

535
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,160
gone by the way so you don't need to if

536
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,270
you've been looking for the product

537
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,920
longer London Underground doesn't exist

538
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,429
it was just so parity alright so as our

539
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,550
last example so real deal market this

540
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,530
you might very well have heard of so

541
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,100
you've seen about Yahoo dumps and all

542
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,170
these sort of LinkedIn data dumps since

543
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,970
on the you know and and so a lot of that

544
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,550
stuff got sold on the real deal market

545
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,710
this was originally put together but a

546
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,690
bunch of guys in Russia maybe two years

547
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,970
ago or three years ago two years ago as

548
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,179
a place to be and that was going to be

549
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,610
cleaner better organized better just

550
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,530
they just wanted to be sort of better

551
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,390
than a lot of the other sort of craft

552
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,450
markets and they have sort of nice the

553
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,520
you I'd you can see is even here this

554
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,290
looked more organized and they started

555
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,260
off just selling software stuff for

556
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,750
exploits and these sort of things o took

557
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,400
took a month and suddenly you can buy

558
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,929
drugs thank you buy everything there so

559
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,520
you know for yes once you're in that

560
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,860
business that's that's what happens but

561
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,410
so and and a lot of interesting

562
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,150
characters have sort of hang out there

563
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,179
so this is one guy were so that we had a

564
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,850
chance to sort of I don't know talk to

565
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,130
we'll call it that and he made this sort

566
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,450
of interesting comment as we were

567
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,620
talking about and we asked him sorry

568
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,600
part of the group but he said the more

569
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,270
members a hive processes the more

570
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,610
processing power and possibilities the

571
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,679
hive has I think that's how a lot of

572
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,330
these guys sort of think they may not be

573
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,070
sort of buddies that hang out like this

574
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,740
but they sort of they collaborate and

575
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,170
very sort of i it ways and and no they

576
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,270
buy and sell and you know just people

577
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,600
have different sort of expertise so this

578
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,160
was from a wired interview with this guy

579
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,650
peace peace of mind sure some of you

580
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,510
this was one of the guy he's probably

581
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,309
not the hacker of yahoo but he's one of

582
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,190
the sales guys he involves of this this

583
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,820
stuff so peace of mind so you now look

584
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,620
at this we look at peace of mind in the

585
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,270
real deal marketplace and here's his

586
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,210
sort of profile and we first find this

587
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,850
op demand guy who's very sort of similar

588
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,799
profile and then we can quickly get

589
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,350
to a few other characters that have very

590
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,330
similar profile right in this sort of

591
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,659
premiere sort of foreign place and and

592
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,970
we see them sort of they again stand out

593
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,129
here sort of nicely sort of different

594
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,119
from all these other 1.4 million guys

595
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,399
and then finally what we can do that is

596
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:34,230
sort of looking at the actual sort of

597
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,860
activity over time of these people and

598
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,909
what turns out to be pretty interesting

599
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,070
is that this op de man guy he should

600
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,779
have been active in in various sort of

601
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,999
places across the web for a pretty long

602
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:47,759
time but and I'm not sure this is going

603
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,289
to come across all the way here as I

604
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:52,590
talk but he takes a pause here for a

605
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,749
while and in that particular time frame

606
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,999
we see peace of mind and this guy Bank

607
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:59,700
in this guy the last one happy eyes get

608
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,139
active and that's something that we'd

609
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:02,820
love to sort of look for these patterns

610
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,499
where somebody takes a pause and

611
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,450
something else steps in them so now

612
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,340
you're sort of to use the patterns here

613
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,659
so in a nice fashion so alright so so

614
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,909
with that you know summary this is sort

615
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:16,350
of you know doing pattern of life

616
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,869
analysis on and I'll say it metadata you

617
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,149
know we don't look at the actual sort of

618
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,580
text as on of course the next step is is

619
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,859
to dive into this important to say that

620
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,080
this is lead generation you know not

621
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,820
saying that this is you know absolute

622
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,799
truth you know you should combine this

623
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,720
with other sort of research methods as a

624
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,309
way to sort of if whether you're doing

625
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,379
attribution or or whatever now maybe

626
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:39,809
there's more math to be done on this and

627
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,789
cross validating and other sort of

628
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,519
sources and and so forth but we think

629
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,019
this is a very interesting direction to

630
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,879
take to be able to deal with people with

631
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,889
better OPSEC than the guys who were

632
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:51,929
using their handles so with that thank

633
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:52,590
you very much

634
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,488
any questions

635
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,250
we have time for one or two questions or

636
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:05,290
no all right okay any one or two

637
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:14,260
questions we have one in the back to

638
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,000
stay away from that you know this the

639
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,280
old one you know like if you want to

640
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,230
avoid sort of video recognition you

641
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,299
stick a stone in your shoe you're going

642
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,490
to walk differently and you know it's

643
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,710
and people say that total example of how

644
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,299
you can stay away from video recognition

645
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,309
might more my point is always like a

646
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:31,780
freak and painful to walk around with a

647
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,660
shoe with a stone in your shoe so now

648
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,070
there are ways you know you could

649
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,630
randomize your pattern you know

650
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,100
literally have sort of a you know so

651
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,960
literally be more random in what you're

652
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,840
doing that's actually the best number to

653
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,000
use short bursts of activity because

654
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,309
this does require longer patterns of

655
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,350
activity so use short bursts of activity

656
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,270
those are the two I'll give you and I

657
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,320
won't give any more so how about that

658
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,470
all right we have it one more yeah so

659
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,299
this I wouldn't call this machine where

660
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:06,100
we called it Matt you know little

661
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,330
clustering with you know good old

662
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,700
statistics you could certainly apply

663
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,370
this to to you know the data is perfect

664
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,440
for for putting it on server support

665
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,730
vector machine or whatever you know but

666
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,070
I would put this you know everybody know

667
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,840
we do a lot of work in AI and so on but

668
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,790
this is good old statistics I would call

669
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,360
it you know cool thank you very much

670
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,970
[Applause]
