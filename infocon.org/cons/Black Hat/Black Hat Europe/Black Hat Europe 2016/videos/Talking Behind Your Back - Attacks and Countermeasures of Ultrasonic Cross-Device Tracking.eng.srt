1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
all right good afternoon everybody and

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,270
thanks for coming to our talk we're

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,730
going to be talking about attacks and

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,120
countermeasures of the ultrasonic cross

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,440
device communication mechanisms I want

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,490
to begin with telling you a story the

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,150
story of a product made by company name

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,390
silver push started about four years ago

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,250
for the exactly four years ago now that

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,630
I notice and after a while a couple of

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,120
years later they received a good funding

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,940
from a couple of venture capitalists and

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,250
this was the moment when they started to

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,579
get some attention from from from the

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,180
media journalists were starting to cover

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,160
what was this technology about and how

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,260
the product was working what you see

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,719
here at the bottom is one year later the

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,859
patent describing the technical

20
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,059
specification of the technology and how

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,369
the product works when the patent came

22
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,040
out the security community and the press

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,439
started to notice that there were some

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,490
oddities in this in this technology what

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,650
you see here is a screenshot of an email

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,790
sent on the w3c privacy and audio

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,540
mailing list by our friends look at we

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,140
actually knew him and in saying that he

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,720
wanted to raise the current issue of

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
tracking using ultrasound ultrasound

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,500
audio beacons such as product marketed

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,680
by silver bush and is bringing up some

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,590
transparency issues and is saying that

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,409
users are unaware of this of what's

35
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,930
going on underneath and they are even

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,470
unable to express and provide consent

37
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,600
opting out it was impossible so this was

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,790
when also the media started to write

39
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,299
several articles about this technology

40
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,219
and what could be the privacy and

41
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,259
security implications and I still

42
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,330
remember the first one with an on our

43
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,319
Skype Technica by Dan Gooden because I

44
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,800
have

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,720
to have missed the bus that day and I

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,610
popped on my hacker news feed and I read

47
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,110
this article this is how all this

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,850
project started and then so journalists

49
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,840
were all concerned and as a reaction a

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,910
few moments later also the Federal Trade

51
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,670
Commission - connection this is the

52
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,350
excerpt from the transcript of a

53
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,670
workshop that the Federal Trade

54
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,960
Commission held right away in November

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,780
mid-november in Washington DC and to

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,800
quote some of the some of the

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,090
transcripts here

58
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,970
how are the new methods operating in a

59
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,030
way that is transparent to consumers can

60
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,090
this the consumers express any opt-out

61
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,510
do they have a choice there is very

62
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,170
little transparency here for example we

63
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,640
would have to essentially find a way to

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,740
make browsers essentially not a mid

65
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,140
sound that human can hear in order to be

66
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,730
able to do some of these stuff so

67
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,680
essentially the Federal Trade Commission

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,020
was also concerned about the problems of

69
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,910
this technology we will see what these

70
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,780
problems are all about in a few moment

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,090
at the point of these stories the users

72
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,160
started to realize what was going on the

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,100
end user a means the end users I mean

74
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,250
and we extracted some of the most

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,720
representative comments from the blog

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,570
posts that we found on the net there

77
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,880
were some unhappy users this guy here

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,739
saying this stuff doesn't resemble

79
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,709
malware it is malware and then we have

80
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,989
some proactive dude saying I want an

81
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,410
arrest level option in iOS OS X - all of

82
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,930
the frequencies the frequency response

83
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,090
in the speaker output at a frequency of

84
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,880
my choice 18 kilo Hertz or 15 kilohertz

85
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,250
my memory fine and then we have some

86
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,830
other funny comment saying do they know

87
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,660
that I turn up the sound during

88
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,450
commercials I know that this doesn't

89
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,670
really sound funny because some of you

90
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,798
might not know what behind this and

91
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,168
that's what we are going to to explain

92
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,650
now at this point the Trade Commission

93
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,880
the Federal Trade Commission took a

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,560
second action stronger one

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,870
they wrote a letter to every developer

96
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,270
that were using this technology and

97
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,360
we're publishing applications some of

98
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,580
them were probably unaware of it on

99
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,990
Google Play Store and they'd say dear

100
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,150
sir/madam the code included in the

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,600
application that may allow third parties

102
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,840
to monitor consumers we recently

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,669
discovered that your mobile application

104
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,889
includes a software development kit so a

105
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,830
library created by the company's server

106
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,919
push that is designed sorry that is

107
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,020
designed to run silently in the

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,210
background even while the user is not

109
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,700
actively using the application and

110
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,490
finally server push responded to all of

111
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,100
these concerns and they claimed that

112
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,169
they had no active partnership in the

113
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,210
u.s. what we could find was only an

114
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,820
office in California but they claimed

115
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,889
that after the three commission like

116
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,990
took this action they say we're not

117
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,280
seeking any active partnership in the US

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
so we all thought this was a the end of

119
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,210
it but actually this was only the tip of

120
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,030
the iceberg what we found out is that

121
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,600
there were a whole whole world behind

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,550
this technology that was completely

123
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,220
unexplored by the security experts we

124
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,229
found some some sparse some sparse

125
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,580
articles here and there but nothing

126
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,430
really thorough nothing really like a

127
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,380
coop a comprehensive analysis so there

128
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,180
were also other with the sound enabled

129
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,130
products that were never analyzed by

130
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,840
from the security point of view and

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,060
there were no scientific examination of

132
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,830
the possible security implications so at

133
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,800
this point of the story I hope that I

134
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,970
motivated at least some of you that it

135
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,820
was worth researching at least me and

136
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,680
the sillies were persuaded enough that

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,190
was a you know worth going into and so

138
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,770
bye-bye now I will start giving you some

139
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,350
other background some more background to

140
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,330
tell you what ultrasound tracking really

141
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,150
is technically and then Vasilis will

142
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,880
take over the floor and tell you through

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,529
a demonstration

144
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,469
how an attack can be carried out to

145
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,979
complete the anonymize at or user and

146
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,619
then we would explain what are the

147
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,489
reason behind this why this technology

148
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:55,059
were like failing so much and then we

149
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:57,879
will give you our response our security

150
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,399
response to the problems so starting off

151
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,159
with the echo system before we can talk

152
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,129
about ultrasound enable tracking first I

153
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,889
need to tell you something about ultras

154
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,169
and to tell you something about cross

155
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,879
device tracking without ultrasound

156
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,489
generally cross device tracking is

157
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,809
several applications such as proximity

158
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,119
marketing etc but let's dig into the

159
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,139
details so you understand immediately so

160
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,189
cross device tracking or xdt you can

161
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,969
think of it as a way to correlate all

162
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,759
the devices that you own essentially so

163
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,109
through an example let's suppose that

164
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:41,109
our friend John is watching TV and there

165
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:43,899
is an ad going on on TV and after a

166
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:44,829
while John

167
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,899
opens his cell phone to browse on the

168
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,959
web and all of a sudden the advertisers

169
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,149
who know that John has just watched that

170
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:55,239
TV show or that TV advertiser that TV

171
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,819
advertisement they show relevant content

172
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,139
on the web

173
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,659
relevant to what has just been appeared

174
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,299
on TV so this sounds I mean amazing from

175
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,829
the point of view of the marketers this

176
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,629
is the Holy Grail this is what the

177
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,069
marketers would really like to do

178
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,169
wherever you turn wherever you turn your

179
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,059
your site you will have something

180
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,589
relevant to what you have just watched

181
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:21,759
at home or on your phone right so this

182
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,089
technology I mean regardless of the use

183
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,859
of ultrasounds that we haven't

184
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,479
introduced yet this technology is used

185
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,620
by major advertisement networks in

186
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,299
different ways depending on

187
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,589
implementation we can divide between

188
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:39,909
deterministic ones and probabilistic

189
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,399
ones so as you can imagine the problem

190
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,169
that they fo solve is how do we

191
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,870
determine that two devices are owned by

192
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,480
the same user so the most basic one data

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,910
that we can we can explain is that

194
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,150
mystic 1 so think of using Amazon from

195
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,980
your computer using your using the

196
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,050
website of Amazon and then after a while

197
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,630
you switch to your phone instead of

198
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,120
using the app you open the Amazon

199
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,730
websites and most likely you will left

200
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,200
using you will be using the same

201
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,360
credentials and the fact that you're

202
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,390
using the same credentials basically

203
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,220
Amazon knows that you are the same

204
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,870
person behind two different devices

205
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,570
right so it can show relevant content to

206
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,930
you clearly this is a fully accurate I

207
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,060
mean there is no there is no possibility

208
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,190
of error here the problem is that it's

209
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,840
not always feasible you cannot really

210
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,360
ask every time the users to login into

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,950
your platform because you want to

212
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,170
retarget the user for the with the same

213
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,330
content being advertised so this is when

214
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,740
ultrasounds and other cross-device

215
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,000
linking technology came necessary so

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,790
with resound beacons is the core

217
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,400
technology that is behind use a sound

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,680
cross device lacking with resound

219
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,260
beacons or u beacons you can think of

220
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,500
them high as a high frequency tags so a

221
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,380
sequence of symbols like ABCD that

222
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,200
encode a certain information in this

223
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,450
case this information is this guy has

224
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,340
just watched this advertisement on TV ok

225
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,230
and the good thing about ultrasound in

226
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,360
general is that especially if they are

227
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,880
short-lived they can be easily captured

228
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,300
by by commercial speakers sorry by by

229
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,920
commercial microphones and can be

230
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,920
emitted easily by commercial speakers so

231
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,360
you don't really need any fancy

232
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,070
technology here all you need is a

233
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,160
speaker and a microphone so it's like

234
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
asking people to use bluetooth without

235
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
luteal essentially so without the old

236
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,860
appearing problems that we know that

237
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,590
sometimes doesn't really work well and

238
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,850
the good thing from the marketers

239
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,830
perspective also from our side

240
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,990
fortunately is that they're inaudible to

241
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,480
us right depending on our ears but most

242
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,290
of them are not audible so more

243
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,570
technically they work in the spectrum

244
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,880
above 18 kilo Hertz in the spectrum 18

245
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,370
to 20 kilo Hertz if you do some math and

246
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,080
you split it into 70

247
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,420
five Hertz trunks it makes enough space

248
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,250
for the whole twenty seven symbols of

249
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,780
the alphabet so you can include the

250
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,640
whole alphabet by choosing the right

251
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,370
frequency and by omitting these Peaks

252
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,920
these frequencies you can send

253
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,260
essentially a message and in this case

254
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,610
we are sending the eh-eh-eh-eh LSU

255
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,590
message which means I don't know a

256
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,170
certain advertisement advertisement

257
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,610
campaign the duration is pretty pretty

258
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,760
short few seconds until there is no real

259
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,800
standard here there is no agreement on

260
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,730
on how content should be encoded how

261
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,530
symbol should be encoded it's all up to

262
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,180
the developers so you can come up with

263
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,520
your encoding which might be more

264
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,290
efficient than this and use it there is

265
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,360
no regulation of any sorts there are

266
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,130
lots of patents but nothing is it not

267
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,080
easily made it to the standards yet

268
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,330
so practically they travel very well up

269
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,330
to seven eight meters they cannot really

270
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,550
go through obstacles such as thick walls

271
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,020
but as I say they work very well with

272
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,330
commercial speakers unfortunately they

273
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,760
are audible by Lara our research

274
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,220
assistant who has helped us in a very

275
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,140
significant way throughout this research

276
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,120
you will see by the end so then now we

277
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,570
have learned that if we combine trust

278
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,180
device tracking application with the use

279
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,070
of your beacons we obtained with the

280
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,780
sonic cross device communication that is

281
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,420
nothing but using water sound to come to

282
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,090
combine information about two devices so

283
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,540
the this is actually all good from the

284
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,730
marketers perspective because they offer

285
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,000
a very high degree of accuracy as good

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,880
as the deterministic ones there is no

287
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,760
requirement for user to do any login of

288
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,770
course what we are asking the user is to

289
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,960
install some client-side component on

290
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,720
each device but then the business model

291
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,400
there is very easy you offer a reward

292
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,860
and the user will probably install that

293
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,090
application to get a reward they work

294
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,730
they can be embedded almost everywhere

295
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,880
they can be embedded into TV shows TV

296
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,440
as radio radio Radio emitted

297
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,890
advertisements songs even so they are

298
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,540
quite flexible in the way they can be

299
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,450
used on the other hand require quite a

300
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,880
good engineering effort for creating all

301
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,040
the back-end infrastructure we will see

302
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,080
why is that and they require as I says

303
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,240
on the client-side the installation of

304
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,450
an application from the development

305
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,090
point of view it is nothing different

306
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,580
but from installing a simple

307
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,620
advertisement library so if you are

308
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,420
familiar with advertisement library in

309
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,450
Android we simply have to drop a library

310
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,520
into your application and load the class

311
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,580
and then you're good to go

312
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,890
what happens behind behind the scene can

313
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,750
be explained with this with this

314
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,800
workflow diagram so what we need is an

315
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,630
advertising client of course you can

316
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,400
think about McDonald's we found the

317
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,540
application on McDonald's in the

318
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,930
Philippine making use of this technology

319
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,940
you can think of Starbucks any good

320
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,530
brands who wants to use this technology

321
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,690
then we need a service provider in this

322
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,850
case Shiva push or any other service

323
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,790
provider offering this technology so the

324
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,920
guy saw the advertisement client go to

325
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,460
goes to the provider and say I want to

326
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,860
run a campaign so they create a beacon

327
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,620
that beacon identifies uniquely that

328
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,960
campaign then they go to the content

329
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,630
provider which is for example a TV

330
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,990
channel a radio channels who embed mix

331
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,580
mixes in essentially the inaudible audio

332
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,080
together with the audible audio so what

333
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,660
you get in the end is the same

334
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,220
advertisement the same audio but there

335
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,570
is also the hidden part that you

336
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,550
wouldn't hear then we go home we listen

337
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,760
to radio we watch TV and whenever we

338
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,650
access that kind of advertisement of

339
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,410
that campaign our cellphone which is

340
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,060
listening on background we have

341
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,770
installed the application to get some

342
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,780
rewards our cellphone will pick up those

343
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,540
ultrasounds so that now we can tell

344
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,600
through the back end by reporting back

345
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,060
to the advertisement service provider by

346
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,380
reporting back that we have just

347
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,140
received that beaker and so the loop now

348
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,920
is closed

349
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,329
now the advertisement client knows that

350
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,519
through the information provided by the

351
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,350
service provider we have just watched

352
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,269
that relevant advertisement and then

353
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,129
they can retarget us they can retarget

354
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,949
us by proposing relevant relevant

355
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,589
products and in the end this will

356
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,019
translate in some return on this

357
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,609
investment there are also some other

358
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,369
applications in in the scope of

359
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,139
ultrasound technology for example

360
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:04,559
proximity marketing this is a product by

361
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,100
shopkick a company in in the Silicon

362
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,119
Valley which proposed to use ultrasound

363
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,569
beacons for indoor localization not

364
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:18,489
really localization in the matter of in

365
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:21,549
the sense of positioning of a user but

366
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,799
localization in the sense that a user is

367
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,369
here in this store so if I have a user

368
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,949
and I invite my users to install my

369
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:31,689
application because I want to offer some

370
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,749
reward some discount then whenever my my

371
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:37,179
clients walk into the store I can offer

372
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,369
instant deals of something that is

373
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:41,679
relevant to the fact that the guy is

374
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,619
into the store at that moment at the top

375
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,379
here you see the powered version at this

376
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:48,549
bottom here you can see the battery

377
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,669
powered version and then you can use

378
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:54,040
this data the way the way you want you

379
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,410
can study the in-store user behavior you

380
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,829
can retarget users as I told you before

381
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:01,660
there are rather use this use cases some

382
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,699
of one of the you might you might also

383
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,799
have used it without knowing it if you

384
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,669
want Google cast formerly chromecast

385
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,589
they say in their documentation that

386
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,079
they use ultrasound as one of the ways

387
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,769
to pair your phone with a chromecast so

388
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,099
in addition of wireless wireless pairing

389
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,138
they can use with resonance appear

390
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:25,029
because they assume that when you

391
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,769
configure your chromecast you are close

392
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:32,799
to TV with your phone in your hand by

393
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,200
the way we just understood that Google

394
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,029
has acquired leaked login which is a

395
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,179
startup doing some base authentication

396
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,330
so that's that's quite interesting and

397
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,550
there are also other

398
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,080
other applications for this technology

399
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,660
such as Audion measurement analytics

400
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,270
such as in big events if you have like

401
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,390
the application of the marketing

402
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,370
application for that event such as black

403
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,070
ed or a sport a large sport event you

404
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,390
can measure how many people are

405
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,160
currently in to a certain location by

406
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,950
beating out ultrasound beacons and then

407
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,980
collecting them through to these sensors

408
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,070
right so this is the moment of our story

409
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,340
where I realized that probably something

410
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,020
is wrong I mean there is something that

411
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,070
must be that we must dig further and so

412
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,080
I would do the same thing that I did in

413
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,990
real life 6-8 months ago I went to

414
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,730
vassilisa was working in the same lab

415
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,190
where I was doing a research visit and

416
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,810
say hey dude I think we have a little

417
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,270
problem here we might want to look into

418
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,650
this technology because there is

419
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,350
something that smells a little bit fishy

420
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,110
so I will give the floor to two Vasilis

421
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,640
who is going to to give us a

422
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,220
demonstration unfortunately I think we

423
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,490
have a oh yes that's right that's right

424
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,720
thank you thank you thank you

425
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,930
so Vasilis at that point was a PC

426
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,930
student now is a PhD student at UCL but

427
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,360
when I met him we were both at UCSB

428
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
together with Shuang how unique frat

429
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,580
Antonio and of course the advisors Chris

430
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,940
crew and Giovanni Vania and he was

431
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,220
working on privacy so I thought this is

432
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,990
the right guy for this project and so we

433
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,540
started to collaborate on this so

434
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,320
without further ado demonstration time

435
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,750
so hello everyone now that we have a

436
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,310
good understanding of how the whole Lego

437
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,040
system works I'm going to immediately go

438
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,350
ahead and demonstrate one of our attacks

439
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,750
because I assume that some of you may

440
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,790
have already started imagining how this

441
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,100
can be exploited so the ingredients for

442
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,070
this attack we need basically victim

443
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,960
with a computer that has speakers and

444
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,060
the tor browser and we also need victim

445
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,760
same victim to have a smartphone that

446
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,220
features an ultrasound cross device

447
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,500
tracking enabled absorb any of the

448
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,890
framework doing cross device tracking

449
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,870
and we also need the state-level

450
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,210
adversaries I will explain this further

451
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,190
a bit later so in order to better

452
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,220
understand what's going on on our demo

453
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,500
I'm going to cut we came up with a

454
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,630
little story so we assume that there is

455
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,490
a whistleblower that wants to lick some

456
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,730
documents to a journalist

457
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,230
however the whistleblower doesn't know

458
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,470
that the journalist secretly works with

459
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,070
a repressive government and intends to

460
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,309
be anonymous here so what the journalist

461
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,130
does is that he asks the whistleblower

462
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,470
to upload the documents through a tor

463
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,020
hidden service that he owns make I mean

464
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,700
claiming that you know you're going to

465
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,530
be safe you're going to store and I

466
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,660
won't be able to know your identity so

467
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,030
the whistleblower is compared believes

468
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,010
what the the journalist says and files

469
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,799
apt or and loads the page so there is a

470
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,410
small lie on this slide and this is the

471
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,720
part that the demo is live so apparently

472
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,580
the network's here doesn't like tor very

473
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
much so we have the fallback plan of the

474
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,049
video that we're going to show you and

475
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,309
I'm going to explain what's going on

476
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:18,440
there we're great but not that great

477
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,800
okay so there is a computer that has a

478
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:39,380
tor browser loaded it's okay no just

479
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,940
make it okay

480
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,510
maybe from here yeah okay so there is

481
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,740
the phone and the computer has a running

482
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,740
toward browser latest version and there

483
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,140
is the phone so for this specific demo

484
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,590
we use the silver boots demo app just to

485
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,600
be able to show you something on the on

486
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,340
the smartphone but normally you want to

487
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,210
be able to see anything there so what

488
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,940
happens here is just the app now loaded

489
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,130
but is still not listening so we'll

490
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,460
press the button to make it listening

491
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,870
this process doesn't happen normally

492
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,700
normally the framework is listening on

493
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,170
the background and the user doesn't have

494
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,570
to do anything apart from maybe starting

495
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,810
up firing up the app but its purpose its

496
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,730
main purpose something else so now we

497
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,160
are going to visit them on the tor

498
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,580
browser the onion service that the

499
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,470
journalist asked us to visit as a

500
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,810
whistleblower and see what happens so we

501
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,530
visit the web site and it looks benign

502
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,720
at first and then it updates itself

503
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,810
okay so what we have here is basically

504
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,990
what the site updated and it contains

505
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,600
basically lots of private information

506
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,700
about us

507
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,440
so essentially you can see on top the

508
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,900
Google account email address the IP

509
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,110
address that the mobile that the

510
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,110
smartphone has the phone number the

511
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,420
Introit ID please don't call on this

512
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,480
phone number the may of the phone and

513
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,990
the mac address so this pretty much the

514
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,570
anonymizes then the whistleblower and

515
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,090
the protection of it by tor is not

516
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,600
really there so now I'm just going back

517
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
to the presentation to better explain

518
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,350
what happened and discuss how how we

519
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:50,060
actually did that yeah before that I

520
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,130
would like to introduce three tools that

521
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,040
the attacker has at his disposal and he

522
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,160
used she can use them combine them to do

523
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,990
more complex attacks so the first one is

524
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,980
a big con job this is my favorite and

525
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,080
beacon trap is pretty simple in

526
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
principle so it's basically a code

527
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,200
snippet that when loaded produces one or

528
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,480
more inaudible because that the attacker

529
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
has chosen so this by itself it's

530
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,300
nothing not a big deal however what the

531
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,060
adversary can do is that he can attach

532
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,680
this code snippet to a source that the

533
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,980
big victim is interested in so in the

534
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,390
first case and this is what we saw on

535
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:35,300
the like on the demo this web page can

536
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,650
be a benign looking web page that the

537
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,490
journalist is going to learn the

538
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,190
whistleblower to visit however this can

539
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,770
be a completely benign website that has

540
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,630
no idea about the attacker and simply

541
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,510
has a store that crosses across site

542
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,400
scripting vulnerability that the

543
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,790
adversary is going to exploit or the

544
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,070
adversary can mount basically money in

545
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,630
the middle attack and just drop this

546
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,390
snippet on them conflict on plaintext

547
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,330
traffic that you observes

548
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,919
or you can record the message and

549
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,159
incorporate this pre-recorded beacon in

550
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,470
these methods so when the victim plays

551
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,580
it the bikaner is emitted as well the

552
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,230
common factor in all this case is that

553
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,210
the framework on the mobile device has

554
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,370
no way of knowing where this beacon is

555
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,440
coming from so what's happening is

556
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,470
basically the beacon is emitted by the

557
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,779
laptop or the organ device the framework

558
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,880
is picking it up but it can really tell

559
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,860
if it's coming from an advertiser or an

560
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,889
adversary so it looks the same to the

561
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:44,169
framework and this enables the attackers

562
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:48,460
also do some other things one of them is

563
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,950
beacon injection basically the attacker

564
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,730
is able to post beacons in the

565
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,639
frameworks running on the victims

566
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,429
devices and then the devices are going

567
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,590
to handle them handle them as a normal

568
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,120
beacon so they are going to push them

569
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,740
back to the backend as federic was

570
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,000
explained previously

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,710
so what could happen is that an

572
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,029
adversary can walk with his smartphone

573
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,149
on a popular store on Picon wrassle and

574
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:19,870
then has through his smartphone speakers

575
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,510
he may lead some mantra sounds auto

576
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,029
sound beacons and then all customers who

577
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,720
run across a proto by striking

578
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,960
frameworks with ultrasounds on their

579
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,760
devices will pick them up and report

580
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,179
them back to the company's bucket the

581
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,010
other thing that the attacker can do is

582
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,230
basically a variation of this can also

583
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,990
record beacons from other sources like

584
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,919
an ad or website and replay them to his

585
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,710
or the victims devices combining all

586
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,929
this now we present our fast attack

587
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,360
so our first attack is basically what we

588
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,980
saw on the demo we're going to explain

589
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,649
how we did it so the first step is for

590
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:06,100
the adversary to set up an advertising

591
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,710
campaign with any provider providing

592
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,840
such services this is step one so in

593
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,799
step two the adversary is basically

594
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,659
capturing the beacon from the beacon

595
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:17,590
table

596
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,049
and sets and sets a beacon table with

597
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:21,970
that specific beacon in our case this

598
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,770
was a tor hidden service it can be

599
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,450
whatever resource the attack the

600
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,150
adversities release it to be and then on

601
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,850
the third step somehow led visit the

602
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,080
user to visit this resource so on the

603
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,970
fourth step and when there is there a

604
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,850
lot the resource

605
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,669
his device in this case laptop basically

606
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:46,179
renders the content and emits the ultra

607
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,080
sound beacon as we see on step five

608
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,730
following that his smartphone is going

609
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,309
to pick up the ultrasound beacon and

610
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,799
report it back on the tracking provider

611
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,909
which is step 6

612
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,340
and of course given that we have a

613
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,450
state-level adversary he can go to the

614
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,679
service provider and say you know can

615
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,899
you please let me know who this could be

616
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,750
guy let me know the IP address and the

617
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,460
other and identifies that you have

618
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,590
collected for this guy

619
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,120
so yeah the whistleblower gets fully

620
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,419
anonymous that way however in the beacon

621
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,429
as we said previously we don't really

622
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:28,240
have a state-level adversary handy but

623
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,130
what we have is the latest version of

624
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,970
tor a computer with speakers and a smart

625
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,620
phone there which is running an

626
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,500
ultrasound enabled framework so since we

627
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,149
didn't have the state-level adversary

628
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:42,460
what we did is that we simulated one and

629
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,169
what I'm going to explain how we did

630
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,880
that so the only difference with the

631
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,799
attack that we observed previously is

632
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,390
that on step 6 instead of sending the

633
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,179
identifiers to the ultrasound service

634
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:00,760
provider we redirect them to the back

635
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,770
end of the adversary a lot that's the

636
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,460
only difference however we want to

637
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,100
stress this point that getting data from

638
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,760
providers it's not that hard so recently

639
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,809
there was this spine story about AT&T

640
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,200
coming up the news where apparently it's

641
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,360
very easy with a administrative subpoena

642
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,899
to ask which doesn't need to be obtained

643
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:29,320
by a judge by the way to ask for non

644
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,419
content information

645
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,749
yeah step seven seems very likely to

646
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,610
happen interest for governments and

647
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,139
secret services ation there are two more

648
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:43,330
attacks that we came up with so the

649
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,690
first one is based on the user profiling

650
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,850
that the advertisers like to do so

651
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,610
advertisers always try to audit or at

652
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,190
least in most cases try to profile their

653
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,659
users based on their interests and

654
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,769
behaviors so the attacker can actually

655
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,889
exploit this by injecting beacons to an

656
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:10,149
unsuspecting victim and fast influencing

657
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:12,399
the profile that the advertiser is

658
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,100
building for them so as you can see on

659
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,590
the picture the advert the adversary can

660
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,779
simply replay beacons or inject beacons

661
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:22,509
that he is crafting to the victims

662
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:24,159
device and then the device is going to

663
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,019
report them back to the backend that's

664
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,119
affecting the profile so of course the

665
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,529
degree that this attack affects the

666
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,090
profile depends exactly on the

667
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,830
implementation that the advertiser has

668
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,529
done the other attack the third one that

669
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:39,850
who came up with is the information

670
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,590
leakage attack so in this case yet the

671
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,980
attacker is trying to make his profile

672
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,570
identical to that of the victim and to

673
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,399
do that he's basically was dropping four

674
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,039
beacons and he's replaying them to his

675
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,350
own device and then of course his device

676
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,509
is pushing them back to the back end

677
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:01,269
so again depending on how profiling

678
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:02,860
techniques work and how the

679
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,690
recommendation system is implemented by

680
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,200
the tracking provider the profiles can

681
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,379
be done they can be made very identical

682
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:14,799
or similar and then the content pushed

683
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,830
to the adversary will be very similar to

684
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,480
that push the victim's device so after

685
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,049
all these attacks and you know playing

686
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,639
around with the ecosystem we started

687
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:31,419
wondering okay why are all these things

688
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:33,549
possible what are the formal reasons so

689
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,799
we did the formal security evaluation of

690
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,659
the ecosystem and we came up with four

691
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:43,509
points that needs to be considered so

692
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,880
the first one is that we

693
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,030
believe that the threat model used by

694
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,800
lots of companies is kind of inaccurate

695
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,010
the second one is that you design

696
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,010
beacons in the great majority of cases

697
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,200
like some necessary security features

698
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,290
also a fundamental security principle is

699
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:06,060
violated and there is also a lack of

700
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,460
transparency when it comes to informing

701
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,940
the users and few other things so the

702
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,250
first one the third model is basically

703
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,790
relying on the assumption that the

704
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,620
neutral sounds have limited transmission

705
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,740
range so and also assumes that the

706
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,600
attacker has no physical proximity to

707
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,970
the victim and the attacker is not able

708
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,370
to capture and replay because however

709
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,250
ultrasound scans are traveled reliably

710
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,020
for three meters in our experiments as

711
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,240
Federico said this is like six seven

712
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,910
meters and there are other ways to get

713
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,940
virtually close to the victim such as be

714
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,900
concepts that we introduced previously

715
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,500
the second second area that we like to

716
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,350
point out is the lack of authentication

717
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,300
and encryption capabilities of you

718
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,350
beacons so this is mainly associated

719
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,990
with the use cases that beacons are used

720
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,120
in so the channel the uterus and channel

721
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,280
has relatively low bandwidth that's one

722
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,190
thing the users are available for a

723
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,600
limited time so when you walk in

724
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,210
supermarket you don't want to spend on

725
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,190
specifics you are not going to stand on

726
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,700
a specific location for very long so the

727
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,530
advertisers have a limited time to put

728
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,380
things into your phone plus public

729
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,600
places are usually noisy start

730
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,740
increasing the transmission errors all

731
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,830
these result in a lack of communication

732
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,620
encryption capabilities thus enabling a

733
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,760
plain injection attacks the third

734
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,410
problem that we observe is the violation

735
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,420
of the principle of least privilege so

736
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,700
what's happening is that currently all

737
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,390
the ultrasound based applications need

738
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,640
to have full access to the microphone so

739
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,200
this means that they gain unnecessary

740
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
access to also audible frequencies

741
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,980
and if they want to do their I think and

742
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,780
gain access to the Sun spectrum only

743
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,450
this is not possible currently so of

744
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,400
course this comes with some consequences

745
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,800
first one is that if there is a

746
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,350
malicious developer he can misuse this

747
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,210
access to the microphone I mean he can

748
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,239
claim that he will do the SunTrust by

749
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
striking or something else

750
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,080
and also if show up on the user or and

751
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,719
another thing that's happening is that

752
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,820
ultra sound enabled apps are perceived

753
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,060
often by users as malicious because it

754
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,159
creates some sort of suspicion gaining

755
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,719
access to the microphone and listening

756
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,230
on the background so the third problem

757
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,280
is lack of the lack of transparency we

758
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,969
observed a large discrepancies between

759
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:47,379
the strategies that the companies and

760
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,270
the apps are following when it comes to

761
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,480
informing the users so for instance some

762
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,159
companies with doing a better job some

763
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,409
we're not doing we're not doing a good

764
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,080
job at all and the same thing would

765
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,880
serve when it comes to about options

766
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,970
which sort of are a lot it's also

767
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,220
interesting here that framework

768
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,780
developers are in the same position

769
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,500
because we advise their customers who

770
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,150
want to embed the framework on their

771
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,590
applications to follow proper practices

772
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:21,820
but the there is no much they don't do

773
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,070
much to enforce them into using proper

774
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,450
practices so this results in the

775
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,000
following thing happening so some mba

776
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,120
teams on May 10th announced that they

777
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,720
are going to use a neutral santim

778
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,390
framework to do some proximity marketing

779
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,120
a thing so this is in May the 10th of

780
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,300
May and later in August they got to both

781
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,960
a app developer and the company what's

782
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,780
interesting in this story is that in the

783
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,430
complaint then the user acknowledges the

784
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,620
fact that the app is asking for

785
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,000
permission to access a microphone

786
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,980
however what says is that they are not

787
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,960
given enough information to understand

788
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,530
what the reason for this request so this

789
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,300
goes back to transparency and of course

790
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,780
over privileging use

791
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,830
and then other case here - line 19 start

792
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,110
using framework and then users are

793
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,150
filing a lawsuit complaining that they

794
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,940
systematically decepticon tumors or

795
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,280
communications apparently according to

796
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,630
the lawsuit at least the app is

797
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,770
listening to the microphone for all the

798
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,370
users regardless of whether where they

799
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:42,260
were in the test or the home or work so

800
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,450
now that we put all those things now

801
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,970
when I would like to give you a much

802
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,760
better perspective how prevalent the

803
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,430
problem is or how and how many users it

804
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,910
affects it affects so the ecosystem is

805
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,010
indeed growing very fast there are new

806
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,520
companies coming out and products appear

807
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,920
at a fast pace however the good news is

808
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,870
that we believe that the relatively low

809
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,610
number of users is affected at this

810
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,620
point so there are about 10 companies

811
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,200
offering good result and tracking

812
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,720
products currently and the great

813
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
majority of them is interested mainly in

814
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,960
proximity marketing there is only one

815
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,910
company offering some cross device

816
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,310
tracking and we believe that not more

817
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,080
companies have jumped into this market

818
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,090
because the interest infrastructure

819
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,750
required for this is quite complicated

820
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,060
Plus this whole box lies within the

821
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,710
Federal Trade Commission and everything

822
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,430
else disincentivize them from joining

823
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,260
fearing that they will they may tarnish

824
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,340
the reputation I guess so now that we

825
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,170
have a formal evaluation of the problems

826
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,760
in the ecosystem we decided that it

827
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,140
would be better if we provided some

828
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,670
solution as well so our first the first

829
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,280
part of our solution is the

830
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,750
countermeasures that we develop the

831
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,000
countermeasures are short-term and

832
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,380
medium-term first one is our browser

833
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,700
extension browser extension works in

834
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,650
Chrome what it does is basically filters

835
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,810
all audio sources and remove say

836
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,020
ultrasound beacons before they are

837
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,080
emitted by the microfiber speaking of

838
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,810
the device it uses the weapon audio api

839
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:35,030
provided by html5 it's a simple - filter

840
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,940
that attenuates all frequencies above 18

841
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,490
kilohertz and to do that we identify all

842
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,370
the audio sources on the page and the

843
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,930
destinations the destinations are

844
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,790
usually the speakers of the device and

845
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,000
then rewire all the audio paths going

846
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,770
from the source to the destination stay

847
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,070
included filter the limitation here is

848
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,970
that because of some technical things in

849
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,490
the html5 this doesn't work with legacy

850
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,240
technologies for instance class is one

851
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,780
example that we found the second cap

852
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,850
short-term countermeasure who came up

853
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,240
with this B is our Android permission so

854
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,860
we created a part for the Android

855
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,980
permission system that allows allows for

856
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,170
a finer finer grained control over the

857
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,120
audio channel and this provides the

858
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,010
capabilities to separate between the

859
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,830
permissions for listening to audible

860
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,700
sound and append the regulates the acts

861
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,680
regulates access to the ultrasounds

862
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,090
ultrasonic spectrum also result this was

863
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,460
for the applications we definitely

864
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,210
explicitly declare their intention to

865
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,080
capture sound from the inaudible

866
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,650
spectrum and then as a result enable

867
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,380
users to selectively filter the ultra

868
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,740
sound frequencies up and fast preventing

869
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,930
applications from performing across the

870
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,770
bust ranking or anything else we also

871
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,550
filed a tour bot report and it's

872
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,830
currently being discussed what is the

873
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,480
solution and if this is something that

874
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,130
tour needs to address or not however we

875
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,960
believe that these are only sort and may

876
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,980
be media term countermeasures and in

877
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,740
order to fix the ecosystem in the long

878
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,060
term would like to argue for

879
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,420
standardizing it so we would like to

880
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,790
initiate the discussion for agreeing or

881
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,760
common uses on beacon format and we

882
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,200
mainly also decide what features

883
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,030
security features ultrasound beacons

884
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,030
will have and then when it's done where

885
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:55,730
we would be able to develop some api's

886
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,250
on the operating system level so this

887
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,060
api's will provide methods to discover

888
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,770
beacons process generate and possibly

889
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,130
emit them and will enable the apps do

890
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,440
that without any access to the device

891
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,230
microphone but instead they will ask for

892
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,900
a permission to access this specific API

893
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,060
it's very similar to what's happening to

894
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,630
bluetooth the benefits of these are

895
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,110
multiple so first it solves the problem

896
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,950
for were privileged egg apps because now

897
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,600
the applications have no need to access

898
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,490
the microphone it also eliminates the

899
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,150
risk that current applications run that

900
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,370
they may be consider the spying by the

901
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,230
users at which as we saw previously

902
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,810
and of course resolves the problem of

903
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,990
microphone locking so we we saw this in

904
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,760
our experiments what happens is that a

905
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,010
microphone is a resource that when one

906
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,470
up has access to it another application

907
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,890
is not able to basically gain access to

908
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,590
that at the same time so when we were

909
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,720
running in this hunt them crucify

910
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,550
striking framework listening to the

911
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,560
microphone the camera for instance

912
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,950
crossing so the API would probably

913
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,990
prioritize who gets access to the

914
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,140
microphone and so resolve this problem

915
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,150
so now there is a corner case that we

916
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,300
would like to address and this is so key

917
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,850
a developer may say you know I want to

918
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,560
don't want to follow the standard I want

919
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,560
to develop my own beacon format and I'm

920
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,510
going to do it the old-fashioned way I

921
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,340
would like to ask for access in

922
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,090
microphone

923
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,090
to prevent this from happening what we

924
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,380
suggest is basically for Android and

925
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,320
other mobile platforms to filter out the

926
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,660
ultrasonic frequencies captured by the

927
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,230
microphone by default and then provide

928
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,500
them some sort of interface for the user

929
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,870
to grant access to the whole spectrum on

930
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,140
a per application basis if the user was

931
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,620
to do that so now I'm going to hand it

932
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,660
back to the to say derecho for the

933
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:11,210
conclusions of this talk Thank You

934
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,710
facilities and so we've learned what

935
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,200
cross device tracking is we've learned

936
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,370
what ultrasound cross device tracking is

937
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,330
we've also seen how by reversing some

938
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,970
apps that by some reversing work that we

939
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,870
did we learn how this was implemented in

940
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,030
real world apps and then we gave you a

941
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,170
list of the shortcomings that we have M

942
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,900
also bacillus give you a demo on how

943
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,630
this technology can be abused by a

944
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,360
state-level attacker to D anonymize like

945
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,700
whistleblower for example or any other

946
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,170
user using tor and we've seen that the

947
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,540
key technology the degree key problem

948
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,790
here is that the attacker was able to

949
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,700
get close virtually close to the victim

950
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,130
by simply uploading a malicious banner

951
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,340
or a malicious multimedia resource on a

952
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,920
page emitting the ultrasound that would

953
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,510
have been picked up from the phone and

954
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,180
then we gave you an overview of all the

955
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,080
countermeasures that we provide and

956
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,590
hopefully we will be able with this talk

957
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,630
and with a with a media attention that

958
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,330
we received so far to start the

959
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,670
discussion a long-term discussion I

960
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,890
think will we think will take a few few

961
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,820
years to get implemented hopefully on on

962
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,410
the problem of how can we get to

963
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,000
standardized ultrasounds in the same way

964
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,610
we have Bluetooth for instance if you

965
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,830
can think I like the analogy of the

966
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,170
allocation of radio frequencies like if

967
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,740
you want to use a certain a certain

968
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,210
channel in a radio a certain frequency

969
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,010
you want to transmit and receive in that

970
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,510
frequency please

971
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,090
you want to receive a license for it at

972
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,000
least you need to inform the authorities

973
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,530
that you are using that frequency and

974
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,200
all the applications that are using the

975
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,320
radio spectrum are up to be certified

976
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,690
have to go through a series of

977
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,680
inspections we would like to throw

978
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,380
sounds if they if they are really going

979
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,380
to become the next main proximity

980
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,300
communication technology we would like

981
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,190
them to go through this all these

982
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,190
standardization steps we think this is a

983
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,740
step one where step zero is we have to

984
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,360
make the decision makers and the policy

985
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,120
makers aware of what are the privacy and

986
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,710
security implications of this technology

987
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,330
but there's more to do I mean after that

988
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,450
I say this is that zero and step one

989
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,270
there's more to do step two is that the

990
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,540
developers should start becoming aware

991
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,750
of this and explicitly notify when

992
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,700
they're implementing an app that uses

993
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,070
ultrasound or when they are

994
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,830
incorporating a framework that uses

995
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,590
ultrasound cross device tracking

996
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:11,600
technology to inform the users what

997
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,450
about what's going on underneath for

998
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,130
example by analyzing some of the apps

999
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,000
that we found on the Play Store I mean

1000
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,990
the results were mixed

1001
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,580
we found some applications that we're

1002
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,380
informing the users about it and we also

1003
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,050
found some application making no mention

1004
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,520
absolutely no mention about what was

1005
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,420
going on we are not sure but maybe some

1006
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,490
developers could have just incorporated

1007
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,920
the frame or thinking of like being

1008
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,320
unaware of this and simply thinking it

1009
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,350
as a simple advertising framework that

1010
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,660
uses a new technology they were unaware

1011
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,920
of all the security implications the

1012
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,530
best would be if the developers offer an

1013
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,710
opt-out or better an opt-in solution so

1014
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,170
that the users can decide whether or not

1015
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,600
they want to continue using this

1016
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,850
technology or from some point on they

1017
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,640
say I don't want to be I don't want to

1018
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,270
use this anymore and switch off the

1019
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,800
capturing the would resent so here of

1020
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,560
course there is a conflict of interest

1021
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,870
really like like in any other

1022
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,870
advertisement library there is a balance

1023
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:18,750
between

1024
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,670
how much advertisement you want to show

1025
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,210
and how much you want to like guarantee

1026
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,210
some level of privacy for the users so

1027
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,890
here there is a very delicate balance

1028
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,340
between these two two issues that of

1029
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,990
course the developer has to take a

1030
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:37,800
decision on it and then what you see

1031
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,010
here at the bottom is as what we found

1032
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,560
on a real world application not a demo

1033
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,180
application this is real-world

1034
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,160
application incorporating the

1035
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,530
silverpool's framework so the developer

1036
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,410
simply took the sdk from the Civic with

1037
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,960
website incorporated it into the where

1038
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,970
into a D application and you can see

1039
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,920
here at the bottom let me see if I can

1040
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,020
move the cursor without screwing

1041
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,140
everything you can see here the name of

1042
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,630
the app it was history GK I'm not sure

1043
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,550
if it's still on the Play Store I think

1044
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:13,320
was an application to read a book or

1045
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,850
something like that and it was

1046
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,710
incorporating this frame and you can see

1047
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,600
that not only it is transmitting all

1048
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,970
possible information that you can think

1049
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,610
of invading any any kind of privacy

1050
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,620
level but also it was doing that in

1051
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,310
plaintext and this is not a developer's

1052
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,220
choice this is the framework providers

1053
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,660
choice plaintext by default not on the

1054
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,460
demo app on the framework

1055
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,990
so the other step is that framework

1056
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,829
providers such as silver bush and the

1057
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,270
one that would will come next

1058
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,210
hopefully we left to be aware of is that

1059
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,540
they have instead of not enforcing

1060
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,119
security practices such as in this case

1061
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,740
they will have to embed technical

1062
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,010
mechanisms to I would say forcefully

1063
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,410
inform the users about what what's going

1064
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,380
on for instance instead of letting the

1065
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,070
developer decide on whether and how to

1066
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,440
inform the users they could have some

1067
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,470
like notification screen popping up the

1068
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,710
first time the user loads an application

1069
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,040
that uses this library I'm not sure how

1070
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,230
this will be implemented in Android but

1071
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,589
there must be a way using a library

1072
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:38,670
framework that when it's loaded in

1073
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,980
application for the first time you can

1074
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,680
show you can show up a pop-up saying eh

1075
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,859
you know this application is using

1076
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,300
advisory blah blah blah which is using

1077
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,339
ultrasounds if you want to know more go

1078
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,710
here if you want to disable this simply

1079
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:59,900
hit disable something like this and

1080
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,810
everyone we should which was coming our

1081
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,300
I want to stress we want to stress it

1082
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,470
again what everyone should do is to

1083
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,730
contribute if you want to this

1084
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,119
standardization of beacons so that

1085
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,089
hopefully we will see in a you know in a

1086
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:21,329
couple of years maybe maybe earlier we

1087
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:26,210
will see os-level api's providing

1088
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,800
dedicated access to these resources as

1089
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,670
basilica's as explained so that

1090
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,319
developers would be able to develop

1091
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,680
applications in a fully secure way in a

1092
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,210
regulated way that respects the

1093
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:43,290
standards we believe that there must be

1094
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,230
also a way although we couldn't find

1095
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,960
technically how to do it there must be a

1096
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,310
way to squeeze some authentication

1097
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,319
information in the very low bandwidth

1098
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,710
that the ultrasonic

1099
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,130
medium offers and if that is that is

1100
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,900
possible then some of the problems that

1101
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,240
we have seen such as the reply attack

1102
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,210
wouldn't be possible again because every

1103
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,579
beacon would be authenticated and maybe

1104
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:12,920
times tempted in a way that cannot be

1105
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,529
reused so with this we would like to

1106
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:20,660
conclude and what you can see here is

1107
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,390
again our search assistant Lara who

1108
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,819
played key role in our experiment I

1109
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:27,859
think again we have a demo demo for

1110
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:30,349
moving her here like that when we were

1111
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:33,170
doing experiment so if there are any

1112
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,359
questions we are super happy to answer

1113
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,109
them

1114
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:39,829
even now or after the the end of this

1115
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:44,210
talk we also set up a reference website

1116
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:48,769
that hosts all the information that is

1117
00:51:48,769 --> 00:51:51,980
useful for anyone who is curious about

1118
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,630
this project and for also the media who

1119
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,819
who came to us in from various sources

1120
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:01,309
asking us several questions we are

1121
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:03,349
trying to maintain a list of frequently

1122
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:05,480
asked questions so if you have questions

1123
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,180
there is a button on the website that

1124
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,609
you can you can use to submit a question

1125
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:14,329
and we will try to answer them so if you

1126
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:17,230
want to join us in this effort to secure

1127
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,819
ultrasound based cross device

1128
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:22,039
communicate communication techniques go

1129
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:26,890
on you big stack that work thank

1130
00:52:33,900 --> 00:53:03,849
are there any questions yes okay that's

1131
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,430
a very interesting question that was I

1132
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,630
will repeat it for for the recordings

1133
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,849
our our friend here is asking if there

1134
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:14,829
is the possibility of implementing a

1135
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:19,569
like anti ultrasound box that I can keep

1136
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:23,319
next to me nearby my office or in into

1137
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:26,710
my office or in my pocket that is kind

1138
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:29,619
of a listening to any ultrasound beacons

1139
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:32,200
in the air and emitting counter

1140
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,430
ultrasound so that to neutralize the the

1141
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,650
receiver of ultrasound beacons is that

1142
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,790
what you are asking

1143
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,829
well this was one of the first ideas

1144
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:44,349
that we came up with and this would have

1145
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:47,440
been our shortest term solution so give

1146
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,089
you a device that you can you can keep

1147
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:51,280
next to you but actually there is a

1148
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,630
problem in the Indus is accel ultrasound

1149
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,349
waves when you go very very into very

1150
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:04,900
very short wavelength since they are

1151
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,809
propagating in an inner ear like in a

1152
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:11,559
non vacuum space what happens is that it

1153
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:14,650
is very hard to record the ultrasound

1154
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,809
and at the same time being able to

1155
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:18,760
counter route the sound to counter to

1156
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,829
counter the fact that ultrasound and

1157
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:22,569
actually what you come up with is that

1158
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:24,730
you can have some diffraction between

1159
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,490
the waves and actually mix up your

1160
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,650
counter wave with the original wave and

1161
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,530
so amplify the ultrasounds the resulting

1162
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:35,619
good or sound that's why if you have

1163
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,180
like headphones from bose

1164
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,369
noise-canceling ones they cannot really

1165
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,920
fill the high frequency noises that's

1166
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,330
why they have all the

1167
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,160
the physical material to try to filter

1168
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,590
them they work very well with a long

1169
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,150
ways because they have all the time to

1170
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,980
synchronize to the wave but that's a

1171
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:55,270
very very just intrusion graph one mark

1172
00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:21,850
oh yeah exactly so the question is

1173
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,890
basically if those attacks can be

1174
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,320
implemented without actually using the

1175
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,030
ultrasound spectrum but in in the

1176
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,450
audible frequency spectrum right so it's

1177
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,220
definitely possible and actually there

1178
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,900
are companies that are doing cross

1179
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,700
device tracking and similar offering

1180
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,100
similar services within the audible

1181
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,760
spectrum using multiple techniques

1182
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,190
differently different with each other

1183
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,950
and usually patented so it's definitely

1184
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,520
possible and this is can kind of harder

1185
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:57,040
to deal with but it from our research it

1186
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,880
seems that it's a less populated echo

1187
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,590
system compared to the ultrasound wall

1188
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,270
but nevertheless it's absolutely very

1189
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:10,050
possible last thing to do

1190
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:27,638
[Music]

1191
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,910
so if I understood correctly but please

1192
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,360
follow up if I haven't you're asking

1193
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,100
whether we found cases of governments or

1194
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:52,920
like agencies using these techniques

1195
00:56:53,310 --> 00:57:00,970
what okay well we haven't found cases I

1196
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,950
mean we cannot really tell that we have

1197
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:07,690
found any case about this but we can say

1198
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,510
as the example that provided the

1199
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,810
facilities provided that maybe it

1200
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,380
doesn't even require you to be Secret

1201
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,500
Service's or like the government to

1202
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,670
obtain a subpoena in order to go to the

1203
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,070
to the provider and ask for the

1204
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,070
information that you need so we would

1205
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,010
say that I mean I can't repeat we

1206
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:37,660
haven't seen any of these cases but it

1207
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:53,610
is not as hard well depends on when

1208
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,870
depends on depends on where you want to

1209
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,360
pick up the sound how far you want on

1210
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:10,510
phone well yeah so these are very

1211
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,860
interesting questions how we take it

1212
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,270
offline because I think there are some

1213
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:16,120
technical are there any other questions

1214
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,450
or

1215
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:33,819
oh yeah absolutely yeah oh yes yeah

1216
00:58:33,819 --> 00:58:37,209
definitely yeah what I can follow up on

1217
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,219
the on the browser extension that we are

1218
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:41,439
providing that that's one-click solution

1219
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:44,349
you install the browser extension and

1220
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:46,749
you have a sort of a personal sound

1221
00:58:46,749 --> 00:58:49,539
sound firewall that chops off the

1222
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:52,900
frequencies that are known to be used by

1223
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,459
these providers and you can selectively

1224
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:56,289
change the frequency depending on on

1225
00:58:56,289 --> 00:58:57,819
your team so you don't really need to

1226
00:58:57,819 --> 00:59:00,519
cut off all the older spectrum you can

1227
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:03,489
simply cut off a dangerous one but as

1228
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:06,789
marco said before if we come up with all

1229
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:08,650
your steganography then yes probably the

1230
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,150
only solution will be to completely turn

1231
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,049
off the speakers we're using so this

1232
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:17,769
would be a nuclear approach right I just

1233
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:20,319
want to kill the echo system it will

1234
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,329
definitely work another thing that would

1235
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,160
work is that on the latest versions of

1236
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,689
Android you can go through all your apps

1237
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:27,459
and disable access to the microphone you

1238
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:31,509
can do this as well but and in the short

1239
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:33,069
term this could be a solution even

1240
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,920
though there is a usability penalty I

1241
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,309
assume by disabling your speakers in

1242
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,670
general what we are trying to do is to

1243
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,099
push for a solution that doesn't kill

1244
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:47,079
the whole a persistent but fixes the

1245
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:49,599
security problems associated with it and

1246
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,479
yeah there are good cases good use cases

1247
00:59:52,479 --> 00:59:54,519
for the ecosystem I mean it's okay to

1248
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:58,029
have a better way to advertise products

1249
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:01,839
we understand this and also if we kill

1250
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:05,249
the echo system that never gonna happen

1251
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,980
so we've got this questioner also from

1252
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,380
some journalists and I really don't know

1253
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,150
I mean it's very hard to convince people

1254
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,040
we saw this also in this case that

1255
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,410
you're using the microphone but you're

1256
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,080
not really listening right it's counter

1257
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,080
intuitive and I think I trust them but

1258
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:37,720
you never know like no one would really

1259
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,870
[Music]

1260
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,790
know in the user sound echo system I

1261
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:51,400
think that apart from being a bit than

1262
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,920
apart from being completely apart for

1263
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,170
users like not informing them at all

1264
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:58,600
from for what they are doing I don't

1265
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,610
think they were misusing the access to

1266
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,020
the permissions to access the microphone

1267
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,420
we haven't found any at recording the

1268
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:12,270
whole space any other questions

1269
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:25,700
but thanks a lot okay so this this is a

1270
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,570
tough question because we weren't able

1271
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,579
to you know you don't know what the

1272
01:01:31,579 --> 01:01:34,670
frameworks the the advertisers are kind

1273
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,920
of secretive with the frameworks they

1274
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,349
don't provide it openly on the web so I

1275
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:40,820
think there are references that they

1276
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,730
were around 70 apps 67 of things

1277
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,230
something like this

1278
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:49,369
the number is kind of unknown I would

1279
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:51,859
say because after the call box laws many

1280
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:53,300
developers basically removed the

1281
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,849
framework out of fear for their users so

1282
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,609
it's currently fluctuated fans waiting

1283
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:07,400
right yeah so the apps be 67 up who I

1284
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,980
was referring mainly to older son first

1285
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,890
device striking the users were nearly

1286
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,950
few millions I would say familiar

1287
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,079
according to google metadata a few

1288
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,790
millions user might have downloaded

1289
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,819
these applications but the proximity

1290
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:30,380
marketing apps have way more users you

1291
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,170
will have to scan the entire Play Store

1292
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,240
download all of them and see if you if

1293
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,030
you find evidence of the SDK that we

1294
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,170
mentioned so it's a it's doable

1295
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:44,270
definitely not trivial and it's a it's a

1296
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,829
Google question I mean it's for Google

1297
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:55,089
Inc right you thank you
