1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
privacy as we know it is dead over the

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,370
last several years countless leaks

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,679
whistleblowers news stories and and so

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,440
on have revealed a massive

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,750
infrastructure that Orwell couldn't have

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,810
even imagined just built to collect your

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,109
data and surprisingly I'm not actually

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,289
talking about government certainly

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,320
that's there but that's not what really

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,310
scares me

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,880
I'll admit I've worked for government in

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,620
the past the US government specifically

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,309
and what I saw there was a large

14
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,969
infrastructure in place to look for

15
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,860
catch and punish any abuse of the system

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,890
what concerns me is is left that because

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,510
that actually worked very well in my

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,789
experience but what we're starting to

19
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,140
see is private companies having similar

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,570
capabilities without that oversight and

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,650
potentially without the ability to have

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,100
that oversight so big data the the

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,400
Wikipedia definition here data sets that

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,680
are so larger complex the traditional

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,390
data processing applications are

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,119
inadequate to deal with them so we're

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
talking so much data we don't know what

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,040
to do with it or what we even can do

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,189
with it

30
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,320
but the question is often what's being

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,670
collected and that's a really tough

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,490
question to answer because it's what's

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,470
not being collected is probably a better

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,899
question right this this seems to be the

35
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,600
approach collect everything you possibly

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,659
can and figure out what to do with it

37
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,740
later we've got tons of storage capacity

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,780
right and the algorithms typically have

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,060
not been in place to actually process

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,030
much of the data now we're starting to

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,470
see that change so

42
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,950
the promise of big data is huge right

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,310
we're starting to see some of the

44
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,650
applications of it these are these are

45
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,989
actual headlines so Big Data

46
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,730
technologies will play a key role in

47
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,129
diversifying Saudi Arabia's economy away

48
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,209
from a huge dependence on oil revenue

49
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,409
and and even the impossible right or at

50
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,690
least almost not to be a possible is is

51
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,680
being attributed to big data and and of

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,370
course I'm sure everyone knows the the

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,129
adage if a headline ends in a question

54
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,730
mark the answer's no within the first

55
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,959
paragraph the answer was in fact now but

56
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,609
this is the type of thing that we're

57
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,909
talking about big data resulting it and

58
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:08,040
and it's really world-changing a lot of

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,940
a lot of potential so that the title of

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,410
the talk is breaking big data evading I

61
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,790
really wanted to be evading meaningful

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,590
analysis of the metadata of your life

63
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,840
but that was too long so just evading

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,299
analysis of the metadata of your life so

65
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,400
why would we want to avoid this if if

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,019
we're talking about the Cubs winning the

67
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,319
World Series and reducing oil Doyle

68
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,359
dependency and and curing cancer so I'm

69
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,489
going to propose a slightly more

70
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,010
simplified version of the definition

71
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,709
here so data plus algorithms equals Big

72
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,480
Data IBM did a recent study that showed

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
three point one trillion US dollars

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,269
trillion with the T that's one thousand

75
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:02,579
billion u.s. dollars lost per year from

76
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,819
the US GDP based on bad data so we're

77
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,620
taking in all this data we're doing a

78
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,519
ton of analysis on it and and then we're

79
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:15,900
making decisions based on that

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,279
information but it based on the

81
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,769
conclusions from the data plus the

82
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,470
algorithms

83
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,810
so this is four and a half times the

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,130
value of Apple that we're losing every

85
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,760
year based on bad data so as a bit why

86
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,750
is the data bad as you can imagine tons

87
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,240
of potential reasons one figuring out

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,330
how to parse a bunch of data is not

89
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,170
necessarily the sexiest job a lot of a

90
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,390
lot of focus is placed on other aspects

91
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,160
of the bad data sources there every

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,930
reason you can imagine for any data

93
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,730
point to be slightly incorrect

94
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,740
corruption of data certainly so we have

95
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,350
to inspector this into the the

96
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,990
definition here so let's say bad data

97
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,090
plus algorithms equals big data the

98
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,750
algorithms are good though right and

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,420
maybe not so Kathy O'Neil released this

100
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,360
book a little over a month ago weapons

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,250
of mass destruction and it's fantastic

102
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,180
as it turns out these algorithms reflect

103
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,560
the biases of their creators so we're

104
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,810
really looking at algorithmic

105
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,910
confirmation bias here so and this is

106
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,419
not in a really overt or measurable way

107
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,290
so we're seeing that some of the

108
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,240
conclusions down the road may be

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
different than we expect and there's a

110
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,760
tendency in Western culture that the

111
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,450
fact of the fact right and and we

112
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,419
perceive these as facts unfortunately

113
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,410
the algorithms may not be as accurate as

114
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,500
we presume them to be so now we're

115
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,860
looking at big data plus I'm sorry bad

116
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,710
data plus biased algorithms equals big

117
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,410
data and and I would argue that you

118
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,530
could almost change this to say big

119
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,070
delusions

120
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,199
and this is what we're making this is

121
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,690
what we're hoping to cure cancer right I

122
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,340
don't know if anyone is has seen North

123
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,539
by Northwest the Hitchcock classic if

124
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,280
you haven't I highly recommend it

125
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,080
so it's a fantastic movie in the movie

126
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Cary Grant's character is out to watch

127
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,940
with some some customer of your

128
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,330
colleagues and over the intercom in the

129
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,020
background

130
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,520
someone pages George Kaplan and and to

131
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,500
please get the waiters attention there's

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,349
a phone call or a message for about the

133
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,470
same time Cary Grant's character waves

134
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,110
to a waiter to call them over to order

135
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,889
something and the people watching for

136
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,990
who George Kaplan is which it turns out

137
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,780
to be some spies see Cary Grant through

138
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,150
this and and so it's the classic case of

139
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,590
mistake and I'd mistaken identity the

140
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,159
next hour and a half as it plays out in

141
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,080
quite fantastical ways but great movie

142
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,880
this is this is very much what we're

143
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,750
potentially looking at when it comes to

144
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,349
this bad data plus biased algorithms and

145
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:46,909
it doesn't even have to be bad data

146
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,699
imagine if your cell phone is connecting

147
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,250
to a cell tower and in one particular

148
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,800
place it happens to also have some

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,469
terrorists connecting to it and then the

150
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,740
next day you're texting your friend who

151
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,319
the day before was texting someone else

152
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,449
who is texting the same someone in that

153
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,909
same terrorist group and so on and he

154
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:11,840
played us out and very quickly you can

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,020
potentially algorithmically be linked

156
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,900
with some bad guys with nothing to do

157
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,860
with it or any other number of ways you

158
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,300
can imagine this villain right you don't

159
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,550
even have to be in the same hotel and

160
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,159
and raising your hand to get to the

161
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,339
waiters attention to thrust into this

162
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,690
world that you may have nothing to do it

163
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,630
unfortunately our our normal techniques

164
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,649
here don't really work against big data

165
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,050
there's a lot of OPSEC information out

166
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,529
there the grubs OPSEC briefing is

167
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,339
fantastic option has traditionally been

168
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,730
geared towards hiding from police or

169
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,500
intelligence or things like that and i'm

170
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,620
not going to talk about that at all but

171
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,130
so we're going to talk about controlling

172
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,649
what metadata you're putting out there

173
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,120
into this big data machine and limiting

174
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,720
information you might not want

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,120
associated with you personally so along

176
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
with all these leaks were revealing some

177
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,750
of this infrastructure we've also found

178
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,100
out some things that actually really

179
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,649
work and and one of them is encrypted so

180
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,390
to quote Edward Snowden properly

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,700
implemented crypto systems or one of the

182
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,480
few things you can rely on now properly

183
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,670
implemented I'm sure everyone here knows

184
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,940
just how difficult this can be but with

185
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,529
doing algorithms and a good

186
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,180
implementation you're probably pretty

187
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,550
good right but so what let's assume that

188
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,339
all of this content is encrypted email

189
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,339
content message being phone call packet

190
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,930
payload chair there's all things that

191
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,850
are fairly easy to crêpes maybe maybe

192
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,279
not for your mom or your grandma but I

193
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,650
think everyone here is probably really

194
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,750
well versed at disk so let's assume

195
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,610
that's encrypted along with that there

196
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,420
are a lot of things that aren't

197
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,779
encrypted so this is the classic

198
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,730
metadata right sender recipient

199
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,140
participants link source destination so

200
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,570
let's look at a quick case study you got

201
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,940
Allison Bob Alice gets an email from

202
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,260
British Airways and then Alice's phone

203
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,579
is in Seoul and a public post to

204
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:43,230
Facebook Seoul is so fun meanwhile Bob

205
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,480
texts Cindy and and I forgot to add

206
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,880
Alice and Bob are presumably happy very

207
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,570
happily mate so Bob texts Andy

208
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,550
Cindy text Bob Bob Uber's to a hotel

209
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,040
Cindy Hoover's to a hotel bob has a

210
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
charge fairly large one on his on his

211
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,759
credit card at the hotel then there's an

212
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,579
uber from the hotel to the restaurant

213
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,709
another very large charge at the

214
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,560
restaurant ah-hoo we're back to the

215
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,730
hotel then maybe the next day and we

216
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,100
were from the hotel de Bob's another one

217
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,800
from the hotel de Cindy's we got the

218
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,089
obligatory text and Alice's back and

219
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:31,019
what is anyone confused about what just

220
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,100
happened there

221
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,529
[Music]

222
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,440
there's there's not a shred of actual

223
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,370
content in this right this is all just

224
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,980
metadata so this is these are the things

225
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,040
you can't encrypt or at least maybe you

226
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,810
can but but they're much more difficult

227
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,790
to encrypt than the actual content and

228
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,230
this can reveal so much so Hoover did

229
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,649
this I don't know if anyone is familiar

230
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,769
with this but we were put out a blog

231
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,819
post called rides of glory and you can

232
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,519
imagine what this might be they started

233
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,149
tracking rides from like a bar to a

234
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:18,660
house at say 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. and

235
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,839
then another ride from that house to

236
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,069
another house in the morning and then

237
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,620
they tracked this across massive amounts

238
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,600
of data over a year and it was all

239
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
presumably sanitized not tied to any

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,300
individuals but they were able to

241
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,680
determine what neighborhoods what days

242
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,740
etc were optimal for what I can't and

243
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,980
and this is your privacy right so it was

244
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,959
funny it was really interesting actually

245
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,449
I'm sure a lot of people were marking

246
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,189
days on calendars like oh I'm going to

247
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:02,760
go out this day but I

248
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,399
ultimately this this could easily be

249
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,019
tied to you as an individual by anyone

250
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:16,769
with access to this data so but we all

251
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,230
we all probably know metadata is really

252
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,550
really dangerous the only caveat this I

253
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,970
I kind of lied to you before there's a

254
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,230
there's more to this quote than just

255
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,630
that

256
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,370
unfortunately endpoint is security is so

257
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,680
terrifically weak that NSA can

258
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,149
frequently find ways around it and

259
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,070
replace NSA with everyone the talk

260
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,040
yesterday about flipping bits was just

261
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,649
fantastic if you miss it be sure to

262
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,750
catch the video because it was

263
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,940
completely amazing what they're able to

264
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,829
do influence security is terrible and it

265
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:58,889
just seems to be getting worse that that

266
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,010
talk really Illustrated to me at least

267
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,569
how bad how bad things are so input suck

268
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,010
there's an ancient adage in the security

269
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,260
world right two types of inputs those

270
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,760
who have been compromised and those who

271
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,860
will be now run in 90s that started to

272
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,130
change and people said well there are

273
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,110
two types of endpoints those will be

274
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,399
compromised and those who don't know it

275
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,980
yet I just say there's a new adage

276
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,399
everything's compromised and this isn't

277
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,610
fun right fear uncertainty doubt because

278
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,550
what isn't compromised has permission

279
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:47,399
from you so another case study here's

280
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,870
Bob 9 p.m. and he pulls out Google Maps

281
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,880
drives to the pub his phone GPS also

282
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,630
shows Bob's driving to the problem then

283
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,459
Bob checked in at the pub at 2:00 a.m.

284
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,680
there there's a much more reasonable

285
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,240
charge for Bob at the pub and any drives

286
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,970
home then 6:30 a.m.

287
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,910
Bob's driving to work so his insurance

288
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,720
app on its own has permission to

289
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,350
location data has GPS all of this sort

290
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,410
of stuff and and even more frightening

291
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,270
what if his insurance company and his

292
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,280
credit card provider are the same

293
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,690
company so now can do you think we can

294
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,190
expect a spike in bob's in trend rate

295
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,710
after after seeing well okay he was

296
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,930
driving really fast to the table maybe a

297
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,260
little too slow and weaving on the way

298
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,540
home and then only four and a half hours

299
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,280
later probably not enough time to

300
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,940
metabolize gosh 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.

301
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:10,570
worth of beer driving to work so I this

302
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,450
is this is an example of the way that

303
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,300
we're going to very soon start seeing

304
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:23,020
this data being used against us so I'm

305
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,630
sorry yeah well so so the gentleman said

306
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,220
very soon right now a very good point I

307
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,060
I haven't seen any spikes in my

308
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,980
insurance although I don't exhibit those

309
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,900
same behaviors so I don't know I it's

310
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,090
it's certainly in the works I don't know

311
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,190
that it's actually being put into

312
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:54,300
practice yet so your life past patterns

313
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,500
your habits what what sites you're on

314
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,170
what you like where you get your news

315
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,790
but what channels you're hanging out in

316
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:13,329
IRC all the sort of thing it's fairly

317
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,670
trivial and let me let me also include

318
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,910
in that account certainly things like

319
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,930
this but anything that is unique to you

320
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,410
and surprisingly a lot it there was

321
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,960
there was a long time when it was

322
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,809
with the masses but you have to consider

323
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,649
that when everything is a data point it

324
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,990
becomes much more difficult to blend it

325
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:45,549
so your locations even if you have your

326
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,340
GPS turned off which cell tower is your

327
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,640
phone connecting to the routes you're

328
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,039
driving your favorite locations that you

329
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,899
go your home and something else let's

330
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:04,600
say that your car doesn't have like a

331
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
LoJack or a GPS built into it you leave

332
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,640
your phone at home and you go for a

333
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,500
drive

334
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,789
presumably no one will be able to track

335
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:17,049
you right so in the u.s. we've started

336
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,029
to see some private companies donating

337
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,500
cameras to police departments and

338
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,779
they'll put them in their cars and drive

339
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,179
around and this camera is constantly

340
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,970
looking at license plate they'll grab it

341
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,020
parse it send it off to the cloud where

342
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,570
or the company who provided the license

343
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,899
plate then read this it says hey is

344
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,360
there a warrant out for this is this

345
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,840
person you know it is a car stolen

346
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,220
things like this good things right if

347
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,320
your car gets stolen and you report it

348
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,350
and a police officer drives by it it'll

349
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,700
catch it what we're starting to see also

350
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,309
though is that this might be used in

351
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,090
ways that so you know the old adage if

352
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,440
you're not the customer you're the

353
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,460
product is a great example of that so

354
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,840
these companies are starting to sell

355
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,330
this to like collection agencies things

356
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,830
like that so now your location is a data

357
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,770
point even without you doing anything to

358
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,159
cause it to be then it's certainly with

359
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,320
red light cameras and things of this

360
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,770
nature

361
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,820
it's we're seeing a lot of that as well

362
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,399
so your interest the things you're

363
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:41,399
searching for things you're posting

364
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,580
even even teams that you like or

365
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,779
whatever your interests are

366
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm from Arkansas originally so I got to

367
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,879
put the Razorbacks up there if anyone's

368
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:57,549
familiar but all of all of these things

369
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,769
come together to form a fingerprint of

370
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,149
you right your friends

371
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,639
so who you're in touch with all of your

372
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,489
social media and as I mentioned before

373
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,009
who you're in the same place at the same

374
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:13,149
time with so this becomes more of a data

375
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,789
point right and and you see a lot of

376
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,690
this in certainly on the government's

377
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,070
either there been a number of movies

378
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,469
demonstrating this type of thing but

379
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,989
even what aisles you're walking down in

380
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:30,009
the store what causes you to stop and

381
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,229
linger for a second this is being

382
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:41,700
tracked too and even your feelings so

383
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,869
something called sentiment analysis

384
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,549
where things you write reflect a an

385
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,459
emotional state or an interest or

386
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,899
something you like something you don't

387
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,690
like and anything you write publicly

388
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,570
publicly is being sucked into this and

389
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,570
as they do this sentiment analysis they

390
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,399
can actually and it can be language ed

391
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,459
not agnostic too so it's it's pretty

392
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:10,509
fascinating technology but it can pretty

393
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,700
quickly result in determining your

394
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,249
interests what you how you feel about

395
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:18,249
things is being used to predict

396
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:22,289
elections and quite effectively which is

397
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:29,139
also kind of scary but it's a and then

398
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:32,859
approach your parent so this is this is

399
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,139
good stuff here the FBI operates the

400
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:36,609
next generation identification

401
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:39,190
interstate photo system face recognition

402
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,899
service that allows law enforcement

403
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,179
agencies to search a database of over 30

404
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:44,649
million photos to support criminal

405
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:49,509
investigations the problem is what do fi

406
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,270
FBI photos look like

407
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,940
it's straight on and then to the side

408
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,880
right

409
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,390
conveniently Facebook has millions more

410
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,260
photos from every angle with millions

411
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,180
and millions of people going in and

412
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,820
making sure all the data is correct so

413
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,690
their database is much better than even

414
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,350
the FBI's and and again and I'm not

415
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,480
picking on Facebook or any particular

416
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,040
company but the amount of oversight over

417
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,840
private companies versus governments is

418
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,850
dramatically less so and in a very

419
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,260
everyday I feel more and more like I'm

420
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,770
in a William Gibson novel I'm so we're

421
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,860
starting to see makeup and hairstyles

422
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,110
designed to Ebates facial recognition it

423
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,980
looks fairly bizarre but and and there's

424
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,330
also a anti paparazzi scarf let's come

425
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,880
around it anyone seen it but it's a

426
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,830
struck that's highly reflective so if

427
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,600
you put it on and someone takes a flash

428
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,880
photograph they reflect so much light

429
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,070
that everything other than the scarf is

430
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,730
black in the photo which would

431
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,680
potentially work with IR as well right

432
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,470
so surveillance cameras tend to put out

433
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,160
a bunch of IR light and this week this

434
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,270
this is really cool now now we are

435
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,730
seeing some glasses designed to not just

436
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,310
mask who you are from from facial

437
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,760
recognition but to potentially make you

438
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,210
appear to be someone else so you could

439
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,240
actually frame someone with what's pants

440
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,280
and then you're writing so style metrics

441
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,500
this is it's also called authors

442
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,260
authorship attribution there's a ton of

443
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,750
tough stuff out there and you can

444
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,670
algorithmically look through large

445
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,770
bodies of text build an author profile

446
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,030
and then compare that to text by an

447
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,290
unknown author

448
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,120
and was a great deal of certainty

449
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,160
determined that it really was that offer

450
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,520
so I included this paper actually

451
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,000
implemented this in Perl this year just

452
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,980
kind of messing around and testing it

453
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,950
out and it actually works fantastic and

454
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,080
there there are a lot more people out

455
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,460
there doing this with a lot more

456
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,010
seriousness than me and so Dartmouth has

457
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,840
put out a tool called a knot amount

458
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,070
which takes in it'll you can create an

459
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,440
authorship proper profile of yourself

460
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,350
and then put some text you've written in

461
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,460
there which will then try to make it not

462
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,370
match here your profile right so there

463
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:49,010
are tools you can use to avoid this but

464
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,380
this becomes kind of a pain right

465
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,050
another technique I've seen is putting a

466
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,820
body of text in there Google Translate

467
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,860
translating it from language a the

468
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,630
language the language B the language C

469
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,270
and language C back lynge by that point

470
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,660
you have almost complete gibberish but

471
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,090
you have to ten come in and make it make

472
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,370
sense again but then it's it's very

473
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,940
unlikely to be tied back to you except

474
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,160
you sound like an idiot

475
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,710
right your timing so what times of day

476
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,320
your active when you're posting on what

477
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,910
forums when you're traveling somewhere

478
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,570
this this right here it actually looks

479
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:39,630
like snacks so you know people are

480
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,080
sleeping sleeping eating and then get a

481
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,820
midnight snack that's actually it's

482
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,070
actually a time analysis of shark

483
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,880
attacks sort of snacks but but that's

484
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,480
harder to track than you are so when you

485
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,630
tweet when you post on Facebook when you

486
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,880
when you do anything really becomes

487
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,950
significant and identify you there's a

488
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,620
fantastic talk on pattern analysis

489
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,140
yesterday which I attended and it was it

490
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,450
was really top-notch encourage you to

491
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:12,810
check out

492
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,470
the video that is relativistic all this

493
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,200
comes together to form what what in in

494
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,700
the government world is called battery

495
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,020
of life analysis it's a fingerprint of

496
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,130
you based on all of these things and

497
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,140
much more and we have well the way we

498
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,910
have to think about this now

499
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,500
so 5-10 years ago you could envision it

500
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,860
as well as long as the people watching

501
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,180
me don't detect when or what I'm doing

502
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,850
then it's hard to it's hard to do this

503
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,250
right except now I have to consider that

504
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,580
everything I mean everything's a data

505
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,110
point so anyone with access to the data

506
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,770
just like uber with the rise of ROI

507
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,900
anyone with that access can do this

508
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,220
analysis almost trivially and and then

509
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,380
combine that with the potential for bad

510
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,910
data or biased algorithms in it it's

511
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,570
really easy to see how things that we do

512
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,170
can impact its in unexpected ways a

513
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,050
really good example of this is take a

514
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,400
home loan typically we think ok they do

515
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,940
a credit check and they're not basing

516
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,870
things on let's say our race right in

517
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,390
fact in a lot of the West certainly in

518
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,480
the u.s. that's illegal

519
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,000
unfortunately the algorithms are basing

520
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,020
things on that so if you if you google

521
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,030
racist algorithms there's their spell

522
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,040
pot that's come out recently about this

523
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,020
where people are being denied home loans

524
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,560
based on sting said that frankly are

525
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,340
appalling

526
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,090
so a quick look at pattern of black

527
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,080
novice so again we're not looking at

528
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,960
individuals or analysts doing this where

529
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,600
how was was an easy choice here but so

530
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,190
you have it two locations you're at rest

531
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,470
your friends your feelings your metadata

532
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,380
all being pumped into this machine

533
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,549
that's been trying to make sense of it

534
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:37,650
and so out comes you except it's not you

535
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:44,159
that's it's what we'll call a persona so

536
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,309
everything you do everything you use

537
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,020
everything you say is linked to a

538
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,190
persona and if you're not intentionally

539
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,380
doing something and very intentionally

540
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,610
and very technically active doing

541
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,020
something in a way they won't have that

542
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,929
link to your persona then it's links to

543
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:09,330
your true persona even the things that

544
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,740
you really don't want me to you right so

545
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,900
it's uh it's it's all in there and

546
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,490
anything absolutely anything can link to

547
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,440
personas and if we're trying to evade

548
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,909
having activities associated with us

549
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:35,070
then links are bad so I this before the

550
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,370
drugs offset OPSEC briefing is

551
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,650
absolutely fantastic ton of videos

552
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,480
slides are out there if you haven't

553
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,250
watched it please do it's really good

554
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,350
it's it's probably one of the best OPSEC

555
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,919
resources I've seen so just a quick one

556
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,780
slide refresher for anyone who's missed

557
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,610
it and it's this is real fast here's one

558
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,190
of the fundamental premises paranoia

559
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,990
does not work retro actively so we have

560
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,419
to be mindful of this going forward not

561
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,240
go back and pick things so for any

562
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,900
persona one account one persona one

563
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,539
activity one phone number one persona

564
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:23,250
one activity one connection one home one

565
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:29,159
device one location and short want

566
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,549
anything one use and I'm sure that some

567
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,830
people are saying but Dave what about

568
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,700
the

569
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,230
one use seriously

570
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,830
so other options have it I'll tell you a

571
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,870
quick story about my best friend says

572
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,200
time I was five like I mentioned I grew

573
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
up in Arkansas which goes a familiar

574
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,790
it's right in the center of the US and

575
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,360
very woods and mountains that type of

576
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,170
thing so my best friend is kind of the

577
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,240
proverbial mountain man no Facebook no

578
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,630
he has the phone but it's he barely uses

579
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:19,900
it yeah he he he you know ten years ago

580
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,630
he's like I'm not getting in on any of

581
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,460
this stuff all my information out there

582
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,200
I don't want people see you in what I do

583
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,020
I all that and so I call it the mountain

584
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,730
man approach right largely after him

585
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,370
so unfortunately and that worked for a

586
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,780
long time today though let's say you

587
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,230
meet someone and they don't have a

588
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,710
facebook and they don't have any of you

589
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,540
Google oven there's nothing out there

590
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,260
they have no profiles on anything how

591
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,460
likely are you to believe that it starts

592
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,430
becoming more of a data point to not

593
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,700
have millions of data points then then

594
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,350
the reverse right it's it's easier to

595
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,770
hide in the middle of a haystack than it

596
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:14,020
is off here by yourself in fact this

597
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,270
this source is fantastic it came out I

598
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,930
believe today or yesterday when I knew

599
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,970
what this is from Reuters when a new

600
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,860
American diplomat arrives for duty at

601
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,920
the US Embassy in Moscow or Beijing CIF

602
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,140
CIA officials say Russian and Chinese

603
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,180
intelligence operatives run data

604
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,100
analytics programs that check the

605
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,230
digital dust associated with is referred

606
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,900
name if the newcomers footprint and that

607
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,300
dust social media post cell phone calls

608
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,850
debit card payments the too small the

609
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,709
diplomat is flagged as an undercover CIA

610
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,210
so the the one sure approach of not

611
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,110
having your information out there

612
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,960
results in you being more of a target

613
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,240
then in putting up the right amount of

614
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,020
data right so so this is this is the

615
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,190
essence of this hawk is is designing

616
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,500
what data you put out there to represent

617
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,160
the persona you've chosen to be

618
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:22,030
available one of the best ways I found

619
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,260
to do this is to actually kind of go

620
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,590
through and look at points of failure

621
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,730
right so it's sort of harder to teach

622
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,790
really good practices because

623
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,020
unfortunately there's there's no

624
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,520
one-size-fits-all and object so this is

625
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:50,710
a true story step one go to Harvard step

626
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,660
two take a really tough class don't

627
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,450
study at all for the final exam and then

628
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,080
the day of the final wake up and realize

629
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,450
oh crap so what do you do to get out of

630
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:10,418
it email bomb threat apparently don't do

631
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:18,070
this obviously so this this gentleman

632
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,710
woke up at about 8:00 a.m. his test was

633
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,940
at night at 8:30 he pulled up his laptop

634
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,440
open it up logged in to tour went via

635
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,590
tour to gorilla mail emailed a bomb

636
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,580
threat to to Harvard officials the

637
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,040
Harvard PD the Crimson witch is

638
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,679
Harvard's newspaper turn off his laptop

639
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,409
and anyone to take the test

640
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:48,370
as expected right at nine o'clock when

641
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,719
when he's sitting down with everyone

642
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,880
everyone comes in and he gets evacuated

643
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,750
with all the other students

644
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,160
- easy right I mean now he's got at

645
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,430
least a day maybe a few days to get

646
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,210
really prepared for the test except that

647
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,490
the police wouldn't talk to Grohl now

648
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,100
and give us the mail said now this

649
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,720
connection came in to get for so

650
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,660
dead-end right I mean conventional

651
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,300
conventional wisdom goes well we're not

652
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,830
going to catch it if he came in via tour

653
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,940
except didn't they looked at Harvard's

654
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,000
Network logs at 8:30 a.m. on that day

655
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
and guess how many people were using

656
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,600
poor on the Harvard Network for because

657
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,270
they went knocked on four doors and one

658
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:51,740
guy freaked out so this is this is a

659
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,910
really good illustration of sometimes

660
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,040
offset doesn't work the way we hope it

661
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,460
does

662
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,160
I stole a slide from the grog shop sack

663
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,720
presentation and again I'm not saying

664
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,190
there's anything wrong with the

665
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,220
information to prevent present I

666
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,550
completely agree with it

667
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,860
what he says is VPN equals privacy tor

668
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,790
equals anonymity so when you connect to

669
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,150
tor you're routed through several

670
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,150
servers around the world non knowing

671
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,820
where they are in that and that chain

672
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,510
and you end up coming out on the

673
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,080
Internet

674
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,140
with no real way to trace that back to

675
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:40,370
you fantastic technology the exit node

676
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,560
as it's known is controlled by whoever

677
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,780
has the willingness to operate or exit

678
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,240
mode right giving everyone in the world

679
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,420
anonymous access to their connection so

680
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,350
who might do this well a lot of people

681
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,180
who might want to see what's happening

682
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,470
there's there have been a number of poor

683
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,040
exit nodes controlled by a nefarious

684
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,770
characters in organisation so the

685
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,510
conventional wisdom goes

686
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,810
connected tor then connect to a VPN over

687
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,070
tor so that even the exit node isn't

688
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,510
being monitored and you have both

689
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,350
anonymity and privacy so the way the way

690
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,000
the drug says this tor connection to a

691
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,609
VPN okay VPN connection the Tor go to

692
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:34,310
jail except in this one case where the

693
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,980
significant data point and and I'll

694
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,810
remind you everything is a data point

695
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,670
and we never know which ones will be

696
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,480
significant in this case the significant

697
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,990
data point was that there were only four

698
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,840
people using tor so how do you reverse

699
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,540
this and done the go to jail line and

700
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,910
done VPN mentor he wouldn't be in jail

701
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,570
so the moral of the story is you really

702
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,119
have to be mindful of your particular

703
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,570
situation and what data you're creating

704
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,170
and how that can be used against you so

705
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,180
that's that's really the moral of the

706
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,060
story so what about Bob we've got we've

707
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,859
done a few case studies with Bob so

708
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:25,460
we'll we'll do some more now Bob he's

709
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,290
he's single now and and he's got nothing

710
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:35,000
to do so he decides to take up whatever

711
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,280
activity is what we'll call it so he

712
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,730
takes up activity and Bob lives upstairs

713
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,630
from a cafe he goes downstairs he uses

714
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,310
their Wi-Fi pulls out his laptop opens

715
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:56,540
up a VM and does that activity so how

716
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,780
many points here are connectable to Bob

717
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:07,670
and and feel free to be actively engaged

718
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,350
here you hollow out a number or anything

719
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,490
I'll start

720
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,820
so one he lives upstairs from the cafe

721
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,490
so there's location so it's the same

722
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,810
location this this Wi-Fi so it's a

723
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,210
connection right but it's conveniently

724
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,880
connection that's very closely tied to

725
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,710
his location and then is personal

726
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,580
laptop so you got the same hardware so

727
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,770
we've got at least three points that

728
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,250
link Bob to this activity and in this

729
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:54,270
case so very very easy for someone and

730
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,150
especially for an all-knowing you know

731
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,360
machine learning Big Data algorithm to

732
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,690
start tying this activity to Bob

733
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,500
there's also time right so time of day

734
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,170
Bob works from 8:00 to 5:00 he goes to

735
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,020
the pub from 9:00 to 2:00 and so we've

736
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,750
got from 5:00 to 9:00 where Bob does it

737
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,300
activity right so there's there's timing

738
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,630
as well over time this becomes easily

739
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:27,390
linkable to Bob so let's let's try

740
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,880
something else

741
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,830
Bob now drives across town to a

742
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,250
different County

743
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,790
he brings his phone but turns it off or

744
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,530
alternately he has one of those little

745
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,930
Faraday bags that he puts his phone in

746
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,570
that blocks all the signals right he

747
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,440
uses their Wi-Fi and uses a proxy or

748
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,530
uses seven proxies and again V in my

749
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,390
personal laptop so anyone want to toss

750
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,940
out any potential issues No okay so

751
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,430
we've got the drive so at least the

752
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,910
location is potentially not hobbled in

753
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,040
unless he took this car or unless he

754
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,370
took an uber or else he took a cab or

755
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,720
anything else that would potentially

756
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,790
have a data point linking him to that

757
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:25,920
ride to that location I would argue that

758
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,740
you probably can't have that that at

759
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,510
least something is going to tie it to it

760
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,490
whether it's the police car driving by

761
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,570
the vehicle or a GPS tracker or an we

762
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,080
ride

763
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,260
or whatever else right so it brings this

764
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,750
phone but turns it on let's go back to

765
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,440
the mountain-man situation so now all of

766
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,960
a sudden Bob's always active he's always

767
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,980
texting Cindy or whoever else and now

768
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,070
for four hours not only is Bob's phone

769
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,690
turned off but it's just nowhere to be

770
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,190
found and then when it comes on it's

771
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:04,200
across town so again sometimes it's it's

772
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,530
more noticeable when there's a lack of

773
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,630
data so then you get their Wi-Fi with

774
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,070
the proxy and the personal laptop right

775
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,940
again same hardware so we've got a lot

776
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:26,460
of these same potential issues this is

777
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,700
this is a much tougher one to track

778
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,250
right public transport to a park with

779
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:40,550
Wi-Fi this phone is on but it's at home

780
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,250
the users tour and completely separate

781
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:51,930
hardware so anyone seeing any potential

782
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,970
problems I see several there they're

783
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,610
just probably a little harder to find so

784
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,850
one public transport has a ton of

785
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,660
surveillance cameras and things like

786
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,670
this right so with all the facial

787
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,800
recognition unless you're doing

788
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,310
something to try to mask that it makes

789
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,490
it tough the phone is on at home this is

790
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,190
this is a great alternative to the black

791
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,340
hole of turning it off or or the Faraday

792
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,990
bag right except for one potential thing

793
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,000
we're still back to the mountain man

794
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,220
today oh because now he's not using a

795
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,540
song so where you'd normally see 50

796
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,820
outbound text messages and a few emails

797
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,130
and you know so Facebook activity or

798
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,440
Twitter or whatever now you're seeing

799
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,820
nothing so again

800
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,130
this is this is better than every other

801
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,330
option we've seen so far

802
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,450
but it's still not great then separate

803
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,740
hardware that's fantastic so what's the

804
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,440
problem with using a VM on your normal

805
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,230
machine - then do activity yeah so so

806
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,960
what if you what if you alter your MAC

807
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:18,150
address and software uh yeah right so

808
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,190
one there's probably a few seconds where

809
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,340
that doesn't take place I'll tell a

810
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,610
quick personal story I was I was doing

811
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,520
some research at my office on tour over

812
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,020
our network and I always at my office

813
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,170
I'll do a VPN to tour so that I don't

814
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,940
set off a bunch of flags that someone's

815
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,940
using tor at the office I had tor tor

816
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,940
browser open I popped up my laptop typed

817
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,760
in my password and and did the VPN

818
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,410
connection within seconds our IT guy

819
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,200
popped his head is like are you outdoor

820
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,980
and and it was fantastic it was a great

821
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,860
sign that that was working but even in

822
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,570
that split-second you can you can sell

823
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,860
out that a fight right which really

824
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,340
brings us to information tends to leak

825
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,150
in ways that we least expect it a good

826
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:22,020
example of this is Pizza sounds it

827
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,010
sounds kind of funny but consider this

828
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,130
let's say you're at your office and you

829
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,380
have a really big something happening

830
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,260
acquisition a big big project with a

831
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,210
customer or something like that if I'm

832
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,280
outside your office every day counting

833
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,390
food deliveries to your office on an

834
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,490
average day will expect to see you know

835
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,660
some some normal number but when

836
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,790
something really big is happening no

837
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,650
one's leaving the office so they're

838
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,380
ordering more food so I can actually

839
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,230
tell that something's happening based on

840
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,010
the amount of food

841
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:07,260
and and parking lots right so this is

842
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,940
this is called Pizza int and parking lot

843
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,070
it ant being intelligent so when you

844
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,650
walk out of your office and all of your

845
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,600
executives cars are in the parking lot

846
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,510
at 7 p.m.

847
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,990
what would you immediately think

848
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,730
something's up right if they normally

849
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,480
leave by 5:00 right let's say they do so

850
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,480
you're walking out of the office and the

851
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,330
CEOs charge in the parking lot two hours

852
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,990
later than normal if you track this type

853
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,619
of thing

854
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,220
gaily then all of these little data

855
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,359
points really come together and and

856
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,520
really start to show things

857
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,850
so in summary assume everything is

858
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,990
compromised be aware of links between

859
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,540
any activity and yourself look at your

860
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:07,100
own pattern of life and understand it a

861
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,890
really good way to avoid doing something

862
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,530
that would tie that to you would be to

863
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,880
understand what you're normally doing

864
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,760
and then operate outside of that in ways

865
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,710
it would be unconnectable to you and

866
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,790
then watch out for leaks where you least

867
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,340
expect them and I'll actually put this

868
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,500
put out a request to this audience

869
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,750
so he's black that we've got some the

870
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,970
most technically talented people in the

871
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,830
world right here so I've been working on

872
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,660
this research for quite some time now

873
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,000
and it's really really difficult to

874
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,600
evade some kind of link between any

875
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,030
arbitrary activity in yourself at least

876
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:54,869
technologically so as we talked about

877
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:56,250
yeah there are ways to do it but it's

878
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,430
really kind of reverting to old

879
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,790
techniques so I'd ask you to look into

880
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,980
this start looking at ways that we can

881
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,850
actually increase our privacy which is a

882
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,260
direction no one expects us to go

883
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,410
there's the saying there is no privacy

884
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,700
get over it

885
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,109
and I'm not quite ready to get over it

886
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:18,210
and I hope that everyone else in this

887
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,230
room feels the same way so with that

888
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,570
there any questions I'm happy to have

889
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,369
you to try to address some real quick is

890
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:31,369
your time okay so we got a couple months

891
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:36,089
any any questions all right

892
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:37,270
well thank you for your time

893
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:45,009
[Applause]
