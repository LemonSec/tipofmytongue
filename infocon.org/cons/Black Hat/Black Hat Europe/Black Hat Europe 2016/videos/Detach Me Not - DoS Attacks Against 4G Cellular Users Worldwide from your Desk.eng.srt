1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,310
good morning I would like to welcome you

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,400
on this talk about telecommunication

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,460
security this is a cooperation between

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,030
Nokia Bell Labs I'm so cohort month man

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,790
who Cotter who could not be here today

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,279
Ultimo keyable apps and sitter our from

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,710
ultimate author University in Finland

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,119
here and we will introduce to you sort

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,529
of what's happening actually on the

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,789
telecommunication back-end so let's

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,759
start with something simple so we are

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,809
near in London and United Kingdom you

13
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,629
are all connected to Vodafone o to BT or

14
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:44,969
orange or 3 or some network operator

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,809
here you are maybe from Europe you are

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,480
having a subscription from orange Dutch

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,110
telecom telecom italia or vodafone e

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,300
plus or some other network providers as

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,609
your SIM card from or UICC car to be

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,390
correct arm from finland so FS

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,450
subscription for me Leeza my family and

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,220
friends and colleagues they have from

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,670
TeliaSonera DNA so they are not that

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,280
many operations in love shortlist the

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,240
blackhead stuff it's coming from America

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,509
so they have AT&T Verizon t-mobile

27
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,790
Sprint subscriptions or some other

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,560
subscriptions we are all here and the

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,409
black hat stuff can call me I can call

30
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,960
them even if we are both not connected

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,540
to our home network they can send

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,560
messages we can all use data so how is

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,570
it actually working you have to remember

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,450
these are independent companies they are

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,090
not one big company or anything still it

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,100
works so why does it actually work so

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,930
there's something sort of most people

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,960
are not that well aware of there's a big

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,710
network behind it all those network

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,740
operators they are connected by the

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,659
interconnection network it's called it's

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,690
a private enclosed network it's not the

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,300
Internet no it's a worldwide network

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,950
and billions of users and devices

45
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,260
actually connected to it via the local

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,400
operator and this MA Association which

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,900
is actually headquartered in London just

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,630
around the corner they facilitate this

49
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,330
roaming and set help operate setting up

50
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,810
their connection so we are talking here

51
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,380
about 200 countries and roughly about

52
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,080
800 law operators mobile network

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,600
operators so that's roughly the scale

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,190
you have to think of and I don't know

55
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,370
how many billions of of users and

56
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,230
devices whatever one I know at least

57
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,240
China Mobile for example has more than a

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,670
billion subscribers so let's see things

59
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,260
are getting now a bit more interested in

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,050
the sense that we don't have only

61
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,150
classical phones but we have there on

62
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,640
the top you see is for example a tablet

63
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,770
with Android operating system attain

64
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,650
Anchorage connected to ATT there we have

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,770
a connected scale with Linux on it some

66
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,140
geek twittering his ways every morning

67
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,800
connected to let's say t-mobile then we

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,850
have on the bottom

69
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,910
Telefonica connected car and South

70
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,910
America in the middle in the bottom we

71
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,350
have something kills her to here that's

72
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,020
a beachy connected gas meter in the

73
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,110
morning actually I saw on the

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,430
underground some things that control

75
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,760
your heat remotely with your phone so I

76
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,230
don't know what how they do that but

77
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,540
anyway that's probably some sort of

78
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,870
Linux operating system on the the Red

79
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,790
Box on the bottom there it's a fire

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,300
alarm and in Australia probably

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,250
connected to Telstra on the right hand

82
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,430
side you see a factory automated

83
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,150
assembly line robot ER in Japan probably

84
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,900
connected to NTT DoCoMo and on the top

85
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,900
of my phone probably China Unicom or

86
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,970
China Mobile connected to that one and

87
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,120
having iOS all those devices are

88
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,560
connected to the interconnection network

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,930
via their local operator so even if they

90
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,150
are abroad or if they are not a broader

91
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,620
doesn't matter they are connected to the

92
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,780
interconnection because somebody might

93
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,000
want to connect

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,830
so you never know if you get a call from

95
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,840
abroad so they are always connected to

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,670
the interconnection via the local

97
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,680
operator so to understand security

98
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,270
issues about this interconnection

99
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,010
network we have to go a bit back in

100
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,930
history

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,530
so now things come a bit weird so we're

102
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,900
talking about a Nordic mobile telephony

103
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,220
network from 1981 that was a first

104
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,410
yeah see some people remember there

105
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,120
actually I wanted to bring this phone

106
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,860
here but it was this big anyway

107
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,690
something 10 kilograms so I actually

108
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,280
didn't bring it was too heavy for my

109
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
suitcase so I just have to live with the

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,420
photo of the first Nokia talk whim and

111
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,360
that's the first phone that was used

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
here so it was a phone system so

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
basically the first roaming system from

114
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,510
Norway Denmark Finland and Sweden and 81

115
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,890
most of you some of you were not even

116
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,500
born then so it was built on trust

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,360
I mean they just knew each other and

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
they just wanted to make it work and

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,840
such started with these four the

120
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,070
protocol used here is the signalling

121
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,080
system number seven and it was

122
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
constantly extended then the next

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,010
countries come along the next operator

124
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,850
some new features SMS data until it was

125
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,570
extended the whole time and now we are

126
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,580
in a phase where we move away from this

127
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,860
ss7 the signalling system number seven

128
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,620
protocol - what 4G LTE diameter based so

129
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,240
they started as a closed system where

130
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,150
they trusted each other and the main

131
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,360
security feature of that system was

132
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,160
distrust and then this is a closed

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
network and now we go to have a visit

134
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,310
this assumption because it's still true

135
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,450
remember I talked about 200 countries

136
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:22,060
and 800 operators and here we go on the

137
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,930
top you see here wholesale the European

138
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,320
Union has issued a law to encourage

139
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,840
competition which says that a European

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,900
Union operator has to lease out their

141
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,540
services to virtual network operators

142
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,250
that's to encourage competition so that

143
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,290
there are a lot of

144
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,570
provide both your network operators and

145
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,790
that the prices go down which is in

146
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,480
principle a very good idea but never

147
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,780
know exactly who is renting and

148
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,460
operations are basically forced out they

149
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,030
cannot say no if there's a reasonably

150
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,500
company coming and say we want to set up

151
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,960
a virtual network operator operators me

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,330
you have to rent it out all the services

153
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,270
including the interconnection service so

154
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,920
most operators have people called

155
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,260
wholesaler businesses sometimes one fund

156
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,240
or a different company name but they

157
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,620
have it all in you so there we have some

158
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,600
area where it's no longer closed here we

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,370
have some service from the darknet

160
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,240
actually where somebody is renting our

161
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,540
location tracking East dropping or just

162
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,300
offering the API so I don't know if they

163
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
just take your credit card or if they

164
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,840
offer a service I haven't tested that so

165
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,330
but it's there and some people said it's

166
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,340
the reason and the bottom here we have

167
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,740
an Internet of Things search engine

168
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,420
showed that some people of you might

169
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,390
have heard of it and you can't find the

170
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,610
actually nodes which are shouldn't be

171
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,800
visible on the internet because it's a

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,240
telco world and these nodes the g GS n

173
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,770
it shouldn't be on connected to the

174
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,570
internet but for some reason it is I

175
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,040
don't know it might just be a honeypot

176
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,740
could be China Mobile is pretty close to

177
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,540
the Chinese governmental please don't

178
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,620
take it it might be a bad idea so there

179
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,260
we have something where this close is no

180
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,710
longer there true on the other side

181
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,080
there we have intelligence services and

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
in the top you see something UK that's

183
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,860
the GCHQ which has Balcom and the DGP

184
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,000
protocol 2013 for what purpose I don't

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,740
know exactly but so somebody was in

186
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,679
there from an hour middle on the right

187
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,960
hand side you see a map from the Snowden

188
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,260
slides on which describes telco networks

189
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,679
which have been compromised by NSA I

190
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,870
think it just means that at least one

191
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,160
country is compromised when it's sort of

192
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,110
marked there so if I remember correctly

193
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,089
and on the right hand side

194
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,610
on the bottom you have something

195
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,110
recently with German Bundeswehr the

196
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,720
German military Hector Afghan phone

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,829
network for their port to be able to

198
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:08,399
target people so these kinds of telco

199
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,439
network information is reluctantly used

200
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,829
to in drone programs and also to target

201
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:18,059
individuals but it was not designed for

202
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,279
that purpose I mean its location

203
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,660
tracking and so on and for network is

204
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,399
designed so that you will move from A to

205
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,309
B you basically don't lose your call so

206
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:28,350
it was not designed for this purpose but

207
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,569
I think in general we can say this

208
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,579
assumption of a closed and private

209
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,490
network it's no longer valid in in that

210
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,529
form as it has been in 1981 so how do a

211
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,319
check us now get in because it's not the

212
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,180
internet it's something separate so as

213
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,069
you saw they can rent this service from

214
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,370
the darknet they can hack their way into

215
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,029
when they have nodes visible on shodhan

216
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,029
or other IOT search engines they can

217
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,569
have the power you have to remember that

218
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,980
operates are dependent on their local

219
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,319
government to get the license to

220
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:07,800
operating so in some countries this is

221
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,290
properly separated intelligence services

222
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,509
and other branches of the government but

223
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,910
in some countries it's not so if they

224
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,589
are then tell me some guys in front of

225
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:18,449
your door saying but we want to have

226
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,610
access to f7 or to the interconnection

227
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,040
network or you won't operate next year I

228
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,269
mean it's a hard decision for an

229
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:27,720
operator what you do then so this saying

230
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,279
to be closed business please all

231
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,350
employees go home no service

232
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,550
oh well it's challenging I would say of

233
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,319
course there are the classical ways to

234
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:40,529
get in like bribing an employee getting

235
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,019
access that way or becoming an operator

236
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,170
like we saw in the EU case we will we

237
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,639
will have an example of that one later

238
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,249
on what you can do just social

239
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,410
engineering it still exists even telcos

240
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,139
I have been there's been one case

241
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,819
knowing where there was letter sent

242
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:58,980
around full of armor operator I want to

243
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,470
have connection to your creator

244
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,449
connection which will ours is actually

245
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,160
in a contract but to my knowledge not

246
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,379
actually in real access of sending

247
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:07,830
message

248
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,050
so that was somebody got sort of what

249
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,510
that so and they figure out that there's

250
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,230
a problem so that's how attacker get in

251
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,270
so next step what doesn't it take a

252
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,780
phase when once you manage to get access

253
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,950
not much honest and years so the current

254
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,520
status of IP security the most commonly

255
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,130
used protocol is signalling system

256
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,530
number seven IMAP protocol you might

257
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,740
have seen in the new some some hex I

258
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,620
will describe them later on and all some

259
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,240
intermediate nodes are involved so for

260
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,640
the big connections that means where a

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,010
lot of people call each other there

262
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,690
might be operators might decide to have

263
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,490
a sort of personal cable between these

264
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,140
two operator so let's reasonably secure

265
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,190
but on the other hand think now

266
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,450
something nice of nice warm pichi pichi

267
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,610
islands specific models place French

268
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,390
Polynesia

269
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,040
you might have a rough idea where this

270
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,280
is is let's see Palau it some islands in

271
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,240
the Pacific 17,500 subscribers there or

272
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,550
two balloon we might have heard that the

273
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,580
first island that's going to be the

274
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,350
first state that's going to do be

275
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,820
drowning because of the rising of the

276
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,670
sea level they have two thousand

277
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,520
subscribers and the tell Tuvalu operator

278
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,710
has forty seven employees so let me

279
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,130
guess

280
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,670
there is no cable from UK to to bubble

281
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,380
no dedicated cable actually that's

282
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,050
probably a safe guess so what most

283
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,660
likely is happening that to Baloo has

284
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,930
some Pacific service provider to the

285
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,870
specific service provider has contracts

286
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,760
with somebody for us for South America

287
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,700
and those guys have a contract with the

288
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,310
UK operator so means if you call

289
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,230
somebody in Tuvalu that means that your

290
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,960
call is to us routed to us then to the

291
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,880
specific service provider invented

292
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,430
Tuvalu and the whole way back so there

293
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,590
are intermediate nodes and we come later

294
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,240
on to that when we talk about how to

295
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,890
secure that ff7 has been recently shown

296
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,850
to be quite

297
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,620
and this has been shown live on TV and

298
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,870
Australia CBS 60 minutes the senator

299
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,490
Nick Xenophon was hacked life

300
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,670
eavesdropping and SMS and in u.s. the

301
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,060
Congress man view was hacked by security

302
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,120
researchers Cosmo and Newcomb a letter

303
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,620
which caused quite a hiccup with the

304
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,500
Federal Communication Commission in u.s.

305
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,050
so these are the legacy SS 7 protocol

306
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,440
attacks and we will go briefly through

307
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,019
them so what's there already

308
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,970
so we know that there are

309
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,730
location-tracking attacks 2008 for the

310
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,259
first that was on big region level so in

311
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,180
2008 you could figure out if somebody's

312
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,190
in Scotland or in London sort of on that

313
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,319
level so but not much more if somebody's

314
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,370
traveling in 2014 things got a bit hot

315
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,220
and they figured out send level tracking

316
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,889
that cell level can be down to sort of a

317
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,870
block of streets here in London soldiers

318
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,880
in the countryside is bigger but in

319
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,829
young alumnus for me just a small block

320
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:28,290
of street if dropping was shown live on

321
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,569
TV there were some raw detects let's not

322
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,399
go into that that's not covered by my

323
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,899
insurance if I explain you how to do

324
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,040
that this is dropping actually on the

325
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,829
right hand side here this here this blue

326
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:45,779
variant that's actually example where

327
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,810
somebody has rented access as a virtual

328
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,130
network operator from normal honest

329
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,180
operators and a nice I think in contact

330
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,980
with one operator they managed to close

331
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,439
down that access but but they rented it

332
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,240
out in good faith so they didn't know

333
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
that this guy's was the piece of

334
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,660
misusing it and put it on the darknet

335
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,490
and then offer the service there so and

336
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,279
they might find another operate and also

337
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,220
but so it's not a safe way to put them

338
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,839
out of business but at least I close one

339
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,470
door for them

340
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:24,120
denial of service attack yeah till now

341
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,040
had a very bad experience on that one

342
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,600
there was some unauthorized testing

343
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,610
ongoing and some of you might remember

344
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,130
ping of death yes so let's the mess

345
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,080
of it it was but it was an

346
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,820
implementation specific version to be

347
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,310
honest and luckily it wasn't one of our

348
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,950
nodes but oh so my love service attacks

349
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,750
against users and networks a possible

350
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,670
credential says that other keys that are

351
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,590
in your SIM card they also thought in

352
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,920
the in the subscriber database and they

353
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,920
can be pulled from their data session

354
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,480
hijacking that's what happening was the

355
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,900
GCHQ doing with Bell comm gtp protocol

356
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,080
hijacking unlocking stolen phones that

357
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,890
is something implementation specific

358
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,300
basically meaning that when your phone

359
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,730
is stolen you talk go to the operator

360
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,730
say and it proponent is done and he puts

361
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,660
it on the blacklist so via SSL we

362
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,420
managed to whitelist it so to put it off

363
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,810
the list again which is quite nice for

364
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,100
for somebody who's selling that because

365
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,750
it increases the values of the stolen

366
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,600
phones SMS interception it's very tricky

367
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,540
because SMS is nowadays used for banking

368
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,980
applications for IOT usage sort of to

369
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,870
steer some devices like heating and so

370
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,290
on even I saw a burglar alarm that using

371
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,490
SMS marvelous idea

372
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,780
two-factor authentication like Google

373
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Microsoft eBay Twitter are using so you

374
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,020
can even go to youtube and see how they

375
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,980
use ss7 to get see get the password I

376
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,990
think what's up a Facebook but could

377
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,430
also be telegram so I don't know which

378
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,290
one it was so this is also as a

379
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,819
messenger section is quite risky because

380
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,400
of this usage for other purposes and

381
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,589
actually there my right hand bottom

382
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,180
corner was a nice sort of piece of

383
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,829
information and that the Russian

384
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,900
government fired somebody because they

385
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,680
were using whatsapp and other fiber for

386
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,690
sharing governmental information between

387
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,150
themselves and I don't know if it was

388
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,310
new to this sa-7 problem or they most of

389
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,780
those services are hosted by US

390
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,100
companies so I don't know what the real

391
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,930
reason but there were some people fired

392
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,770
and actually also if you search the nist

393
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,990
national internet institute in you

394
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,119
and their latest draft for

395
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,129
authentication if you go down down down

396
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:53,899
down summer and chapter five I think

397
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:57,440
they said that SMS please don't no

398
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,059
longer use it for authentication

399
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,700
purposes or sensitive stuff I don't

400
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,619
remember the exact rating but it's in

401
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,499
them in draft so I think they realize

402
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:12,049
that there will be some issues so that's

403
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,320
the legacy protocol ss7

404
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,249
now we need two new x 4g LTE be basted

405
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:23,840
pipes and so on so some people might say

406
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,570
all will be better with LTE and diameter

407
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,789
we will have no security issues because

408
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,269
everything is perfect and so on so I

409
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,080
tend to sort of somewhat disagree is a

410
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,850
really different so and the reason is as

411
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,940
a seven and map and diameter they are

412
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,799
made for a similar job let's call a

413
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,340
Bentley you roam you set up a call you

414
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,559
update the location you want to send a

415
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,529
mess so the ideas for the function

416
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,720
what's supposed to do is very very

417
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,240
similar it's not it's not the same

418
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,639
protocol it works slightly different the

419
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,220
protocol fields are different so it's

420
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,090
not a one-to-one thingy so but it's the

421
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,309
ideas of the messages are very very

422
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,509
similar so and recently also some

423
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:16,419
attacks were known this year there was

424
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,980
location tracking on another conference

425
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,590
and tallying there were some

426
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,480
interworking attacks that's basically a

427
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,929
bidding down attack and also SMS

428
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,879
interception I hope to get that

429
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:31,490
published next year somewhere so so it

430
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,139
submitted and on the review SMS

431
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,600
intercept is also possible in diameter

432
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,909
which is interesting for this one-time

433
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:42,529
password things and 14 so auto diameter

434
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,529
has some new features of course every

435
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:47,149
time there's a new protocol they want

436
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:50,059
everybody married to a geek so everybody

437
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,619
wants to put a lot of features in it so

438
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:55,159
and that's not different here with 4G

439
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,799
LTE so let's see how these features

440
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,200
might be exploited in the future sort of

441
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,789
to come

442
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,950
I have to pull you through that but I

443
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,809
keep try to keep a gentle touch on it

444
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,220
because I know most of you are not from

445
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,769
telco environment so but there are some

446
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:12,289
note I will talk about you have to be

447
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,820
know roughly at least what we are known

448
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,409
so you have here all the kinds of

449
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:18,169
devices your phone tablets cameras

450
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:21,009
whatever you hear the excess network and

451
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,169
we are talking about the backend so this

452
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,470
is vhss this is the most important piece

453
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,409
in an operator database it's the thing

454
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,879
where all your subscription data is

455
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,099
solved if you have prepaid post pace

456
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:34,849
data

457
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,669
flat rate it's all stored into the HSS

458
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,019
if this box is down you have no network

459
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,539
nothing believe me if an operator

460
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,539
updates HSS they also sit there so it is

461
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,919
important if it's working it is working

462
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,729
so HSS is the most critical piece of

463
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,690
infrastructure and operated networks

464
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,970
there all the data of all subscriber for

465
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,720
one Operator in there then there are the

466
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,789
mobility management entities this guys

467
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,679
basically keep track sort of where you

468
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,820
are on and manage those guys here those

469
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,200
antennae guys an operator let's say in

470
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,080
UK probably has between five and ten of

471
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,289
them for the whole network so we are

472
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,940
here in London for London they might

473
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,279
have two or something so I don't know

474
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,259
exactly but there will not be too many

475
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:27,529
here so they cover a very large region

476
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,809
usually in the wall subscriber here on

477
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:31,159
the edge of the network we have

478
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,080
something called diameter edge agent

479
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,940
think of it as a some sort of door

480
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,809
keeper for diameter and when you connect

481
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,669
to another network the other cloud over

482
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:43,700
there you might have to go wire some IP

483
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,739
x providers remember the specific

484
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,289
example these would appear the us guys

485
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,499
or the specific guys here and on the

486
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:53,210
other side you have the basically the

487
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,309
mirror of this network here so that's

488
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,820
how to mobile ad networks would connect

489
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,460
in a very simple manner so next we

490
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,090
introduced a testing setup that we used

491
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,899
there was a major global operator which

492
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:14,330
also here UK which allows us to connect

493
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,630
to their test network

494
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,120
so prompting land we were connecting to

495
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,200
the test network here in UK and the

496
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,520
introduction will be done by my

497
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,560
colleague Andrew Cotter you cannot hear

498
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,110
him reluctantly but because for

499
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,630
technical reason but I will take you to

500
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:43,160
the test setup anyway so we so basically

501
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,530
here that's often Finland we connect to

502
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:52,560
the diameter occasion of mass so and if

503
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,660
the test network has here the home

504
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,510
subscriber service for the Boxee on top

505
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,050
the mobility entity then we had the

506
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,880
radio base station in the test network

507
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,270
of 20 operator and then we had a

508
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,940
terminal you we connected that's a

509
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,220
dormer in that case that's also why your

510
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,780
scenes name away so there's nothing

511
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,700
wrong with flew away it's just if you

512
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,440
used a dongle that's why they are you

513
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,600
would see the name of these on the

514
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,400
slides further on to so that the test

515
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:33,470
setup that we used corrective what so

516
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,450
now we have to do the envy retrieval I

517
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,370
know some of you having yesterday the

518
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,960
talk in the first one the morning on

519
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,660
this on the weather use well plan a pap

520
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,300
a case for retrieving the in zis is

521
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,280
another way to do a think so because

522
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,320
this will talk about interconnection and

523
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,300
so what is the envy for those guys who

524
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,000
haven't been yeah yes a day so you know

525
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,160
each other's phones by phone number but

526
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,990
actually the phone network is using

527
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,430
something else the two sorts in

528
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,020
something in V that's international

529
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,780
mobile subscriber identity it's your ID

530
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,810
in the phone network most messages in

531
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,630
the phone network well nearly all you

532
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,480
need this meet this number the 15 digit

533
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
number and without that you cannot send

534
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,470
messages because that's how you identify

535
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,840
for which subscribers messages you need

536
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,770
to know that so what we do actually here

537
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,490
I tried

538
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,550
to describe that reforms we claim to be

539
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,700
an SMS see that we are saying hello I'm

540
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,580
an SMS server in a foreign country and

541
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,650
have an SMS I want to deliver to that

542
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,200
user can you please tell me his identity

543
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,620
and where I can find him let this

544
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,520
message this s RR sans routing

545
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,770
information for short message request as

546
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,440
RR so basically I'm just saying hey I

547
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
have a message can you help me deliver

548
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,730
it and of course the HSS is a very nice

549
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,890
one and says yes of course this is in

550
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,100
the M PS a server that's handing this

551
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,870
user this Mme so this is a for those

552
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,760
people who are familiar with the SS

553
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,250
seven attacks that have been presented

554
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,670
by cast no this is a very basically a

555
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,200
mirror of the SR is M trick the bottom

556
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,120
there so in that case similarity between

557
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,110
diameter and SS 7 is very high to get

558
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,000
the in D as you saw yesterday you can

559
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,809
also use wireless LAN aka protocol or

560
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:40,110
you can get physical access to the to

561
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,110
the device or you can go to China if the

562
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,580
person happens to be there and ran for

563
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,370
$50 and paste take base station for now

564
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,880
in Beijing so that the enterprise there

565
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,010
they put it in a motorbike mommy so

566
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,300
that's how you get to in Z and from

567
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,710
there you can really then start

568
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,520
launching and then check so let's let's

569
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,650
kick the user out of network what how we

570
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,470
do this we make a cancel location

571
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,580
request so what is it usually for so it

572
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,100
should be a sort of clean up message so

573
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,080
when you move from one area to another

574
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,130
area so it's for housekeeping if some

575
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,900
data is no longer needed then it sort of

576
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,780
cleaned up also if you don't pay your

577
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,700
bills of course you all pay your bills

578
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,950
up just in case you forget too long to

579
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,280
do it

580
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,850
the operator will do census this

581
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,940
cleaning message to the mme basically to

582
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,470
wipe you from network so this contains

583
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,610
the envy we just got and it says

584
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,710
scription withdrawal in that case that

585
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,120
we sent here this cancellation type to

586
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,429
sort of and we do something nasty

587
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,480
we set the CLL flag three and what that

588
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,809
is doing it asks the device to reconnect

589
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,760
again I will let explain why we are

590
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,270
doing that so because it has on my side

591
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,140
effect so we have another video here how

592
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,350
it's running live well not really life

593
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,540
so that's my colleague band home you

594
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,400
cannot use voice again so but no mine so

595
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,900
we have here as you can see location

596
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,600
request that we send we have here the

597
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,970
cancellation type we see in subscription

598
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,690
withdrawal and the slack here asking the

599
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,090
device to reconnect again so if we kick

600
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,419
it out and then we offer to come back so

601
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,450
and you will see soon why we are doing

602
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,140
it so he started and said this is just

603
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:52,000
for the dongle and so they thought that

604
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,790
I'm sorry we were not allowed a PR

605
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,380
department of the operator didn't want

606
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,090
us to mention the name but they're great

607
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,340
guys and they do a great job on security

608
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,350
so we have seen much other things so

609
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:17,179
here we start decline and sex so so now

610
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,799
it's to connect it soon we'll go

611
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,460
unconnected and then come back again let

612
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,010
me show see what you see here disconnect

613
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,700
and it the terminal immediately connects

614
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:41,720
again so you see the diameters that are

615
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,169
going that are going on so and it's also

616
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:47,240
some lower level messages like the last

617
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,130
message if you see the can't location

618
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,650
request and and then actually

619
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,590
what happens on first detach takes place

620
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,840
and then afterwards the the new attach

621
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,570
takes place and the interesting part

622
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,430
about that is if you're not too

623
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,660
interesting the details is that on the

624
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,520
interconnection we sent one message and

625
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,040
it's called in something like 20

626
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,670
messages on the of the radio interface

627
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,800
so that means it's an attacker can use

628
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,010
that for an amplification of netic so

629
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,020
you can first track a bunch of users

630
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,440
that are residing in the same area and

631
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,280
then sends let's say to those 200 person

632
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,860
these messages and then they all would

633
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,740
come back with 20 messages for each guy

634
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,260
and sort of do some quite some damage

635
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,050
for the Mme we haven't tested the limit

636
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,610
as we said we did that in the test

637
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,380
network because if we will do that in

638
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,640
the real network we might close a

639
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,590
service or for London accidentally or

640
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,910
something like that so we didn't want to

641
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,280
do that so you might understand that so

642
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,330
but we notice that there is a

643
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,960
side-effect - as that might cause a

644
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,140
signalling strong so so there's a risk

645
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,480
of a denial of service attack not only

646
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,130
against the user but due to this

647
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,410
amplification against the Mme in the

648
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,370
network so and I said we don't know

649
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,170
exactly how big the risk is because it

650
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,270
depends on many parameters how big the

651
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,580
enemy's scale sort of how many users are

652
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,500
there already in how big the signaling

653
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,240
load is in that moment in the network so

654
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,670
it's hard to test it and we're without

655
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:38,780
calling damage so that's not the only

656
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,160
way to kick out the user we have

657
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,630
actually four ways but I want to show

658
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,940
you two videos of Baba

659
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,120
so that's an IDR just insert subscriber

660
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,940
data request it's used for updating

661
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,210
information so let's say you upgrades

662
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,370
your account you bought in from your

663
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,670
services or similar stuff so what we are

664
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,480
doing the impersonation home network and

665
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,490
say to the mobility management entity

666
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,100
here this user subscription has chain

667
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,040
please update the service which you can

668
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,040
give to the user so in this case we use

669
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
the number of five one one and that

670
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,730
means nothing so that means that you

671
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,240
don't get any service just the sort of

672
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,620
basically killed command so you don't

673
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,650
have we forbid every service operate

674
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,210
determine powering its course and

675
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,400
depending on which number you put at the

676
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,460
end you might allow or disallow some

677
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,270
services so until we say no service so

678
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,640
of course you can think about playing

679
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,820
around with the number but I suppose

680
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,890
that you are still built for it I

681
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,540
haven't tested it all because we didn't

682
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,830
have a billing system in the test

683
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,720
network so but you would get served if

684
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,040
you play around with that number you

685
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,630
would get access to the service it's

686
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,950
just a question of what happens

687
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,590
afterwards so but if you have a prepaid

688
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,600
and you put their old services I don't

689
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,040
know exactly what would happen so

690
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,049
there's some risk of fraud here would

691
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,600
say some potential risk so and even if

692
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,980
see a check is to the Mme since the Mme

693
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,790
as explained covers a very large area it

694
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,580
has quite an impact so as long as you

695
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,200
would stay in this area you are affected

696
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,580
by this attack so here's the video again

697
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,720
how it works and we insert subscriber

698
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,960
data there to observe a little request

699
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,270
there we have Mueller name that simply

700
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,059
we fished before and here we have

701
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:51,929
operated these on my borrowing and it's

702
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,150
a value 5.1 which basically says no

703
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,590
service at all and here which means you

704
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,770
are sort of permanently disconnected so

705
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,840
there are some more messages but it's

706
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,390
not so bad as in the in the other case

707
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,000
location request so the amount of

708
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
messages are sent on the radio channel

709
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,130
is not static

710
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,010
so you see soon going into this

711
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,170
connected space and it just stays

712
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,610
there's no service and whatever you do

713
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,540
it won't help because you're Mme thinks

714
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,950
that your subscription has changed

715
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,360
you're not allowed to do something so

716
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,010
you would really need to call the

717
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,660
operators not with that phone but with

718
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,400
another phone and tell him to fix

719
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,250
basically your profile it probably takes

720
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,690
a while so because then also the update

721
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,220
needs to play take place in the

722
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,390
different node so this is here the mass

723
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,670
level messages on the radio interface

724
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:08,430
and then so they were disconnected so

725
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,679
and the other way to disconnect I don't

726
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,870
go to show that as a video but it also

727
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,560
works

728
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,510
so it's an update location request it's

729
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,460
usually something very commonly send for

730
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,080
a message you can just block or

731
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,389
something when you move from another

732
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,219
country the first thing that's happening

733
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,199
is one of the first things that's

734
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,000
happening is that an update vocational

735
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,739
press is saying hey loser is here now

736
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,889
please please update the location and

737
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,110
what's happening then the location

738
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,659
information centers of gravity base and

739
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,850
this basically cleans up then the

740
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,860
information in your previous location

741
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,780
so you're basically deleted from your

742
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,389
previous location because you are no

743
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,219
longer there so why should a data be you

744
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,659
there so they're just efficiency

745
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,720
measures measure so and we have there

746
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,240
the black number six which is basically

747
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,830
indicates that is cleaning up operation

748
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,020
CLR operation should take place

749
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,010
so update location request is just a

750
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,010
simple soft key code it's no big side

751
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,430
effect and actually but this one can be

752
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,500
fixed very easily if you switch off your

753
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,410
phone and reconnect then it's sort of

754
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,360
your phone should be able to get

755
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,100
serviced again so that's actually what

756
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,710
harmless

757
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,410
that sense that easily to sort of fix

758
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,369
from a user's point of perspective what

759
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,400
else we have something that sort of like

760
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,980
a sitting duck in the sense that we

761
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,190
combine several message types denial of

762
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,160
service using this insert subscriber

763
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,200
data idea as we s Arriflex saying like

764
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,080
one saying that we want to have

765
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,990
information when the user comes back so

766
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,450
this is a so please inform me when the

767
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,180
user shows up and it says yes I will do

768
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,330
that and then you have popped up and

769
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,119
then and I notification request is hey

770
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,680
the you are there and then they say I

771
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,720
don't know that user who is that and

772
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,660
then it will detach because of us

773
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,940
unknown so it's a source meeting but

774
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,990
well it is connected to user this attack

775
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,680
if we user would then switch office so

776
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,420
when I switch it on again then it should

777
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,940
work again so it's not it's not the sort

778
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,010
of permanent thing so now we have seen

779
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,609
several denial of service attacks for

780
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:45,020
one with performance impact on the

781
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,320
network and one which showed up as a

782
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,040
risk of potential fraud so now we go on

783
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,020
to the countermeasures and you might say

784
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,740
okay diameter that's IP based so let's

785
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,400
use IPSec well it's not arm and form a

786
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,310
company so we have to take a practical

787
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,470
view of things we cannot just say to the

788
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,740
Opera Strix at all we have to think

789
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,390
about how it works really works in

790
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:14,930
practice

791
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,290
so 3gpp is at the third generation

792
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,880
partnerships this is something like IITs

793
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,310
for telecourse but if those people are

794
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,589
not familiar with them they have

795
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:28,369
standardized IPSec for core network

796
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:31,280
nodes and PR 33 to 1 zeros at the NDS IP

797
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,619
it's actually mandatory to implement for

798
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,960
us but we have to implement that but the

799
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,380
news is optional it was more different

800
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,349
there because some countries don't like

801
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:44,300
security in the network

802
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,090
some legislators don't like that I'm

803
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,410
going to mention any countries but

804
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,720
that's a fact so also some network

805
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,220
operators don't switch it on because

806
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,640
they are threat of performance impacts

807
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:05,210
so that's where things are and so but

808
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,650
and also there are some other hooks

809
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,320
related to IPSec so first there's this

810
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,060
interworking with with SSM because ss7

811
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,150
su use SCTP that's our transport

812
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,800
protocol some people might remember that

813
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,210
there's a third one so and that means we

814
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,500
still have to work with those guys

815
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,930
because there's no roaming you cannot

816
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,360
say ok we don't support a protocol D

817
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,830
user you cannot travel there you don't

818
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,680
have phone connection there no what's up

819
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,330
so this is interworking always and then

820
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,670
we come to a very very tricky issue who

821
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,850
will host create the root certificates

822
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,690
and generate the keys and I mean I just

823
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,540
throw some country names and you china

824
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,740
UK USA Pakistan India do you think those

825
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,600
guys could agree on one root certificate

826
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,570
who hosts the revocation list well let's

827
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,760
say unlikely at least in the future

828
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,650
maybe we are optimistic ampere workpiece

829
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,900
very soon also there are some money

830
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,120
issue involves the third operator and

831
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,480
South Sudan do you think you can afford

832
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,680
a PCI infrastructure and now unlikely I

833
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,010
would say also remember this to value

834
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,680
example with 47 employees how many

835
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,920
security experts to the head maybe one

836
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,840
maybe two we have talked to mr. Chiesa

837
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,150
so it's also a matter of expertise so

838
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,550
and there are two thousand subscriber if

839
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,590
they by now is signalling file or they

840
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,660
cannot charge 50 bucks more for me to

841
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,900
subscribers just doesn't so there are

842
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,430
the sort of practical considerations and

843
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,380
also there is I hope I hope issue as

844
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,910
mentioned yeah so they are you only get

845
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,530
hope I hope security even with IPSec and

846
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,330
also even if we have everybody would

847
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,980
have using IPSec that

848
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,760
be perfect and but the ref is renting

849
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,390
out problem to service companies that do

850
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,950
then something else with the excess once

851
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,550
they have it

852
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,760
we have hex node we have brought

853
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,520
employees and we have governmental ties

854
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,869
let's call it that way so there is no no

855
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:20,359
helping those with IPSec if you sit in

856
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:24,350
the end point and so but still IPSec I

857
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,910
think is an important piece in the

858
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,109
puzzle to protect things so we saw ff7

859
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:32,119
has many weaknesses we saw a diameter

860
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,550
has also some weaknesses maybe not as

861
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,820
many as hopefully not as many as a seven

862
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,670
so but now is the right time to think

863
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,890
about securing diameter so that we don't

864
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,600
end up in the same mess as the evidence

865
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,560
as a seven so first people have to think

866
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,359
about detecting what's going on in the

867
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,130
network all the tenants really doing

868
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,710
what they say they do and the contract

869
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,520
so you have to sue check very careful

870
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,040
fraud mitigation systems have also quite

871
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,010
a lot the next step is to mitigate may

872
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,200
to be filtering at the edge often you

873
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,730
remember this guy sitting on the edge of

874
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,680
the cloud is diameter education there's

875
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,260
the right place to filter you filter for

876
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,390
messages you filter for flex you were

877
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,850
seeing I was using complex so you can

878
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,590
filter for those flex if they should be

879
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,210
there in a normal roaming scenario or

880
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,770
not if they are suddenly there they have

881
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,480
no point of being they are perceived as

882
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,040
an adult so IPSec already helps somewhat

883
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,050
because if you have partners it always

884
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,660
would use IP tech towards you and then

885
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,220
suddenly is coming something claiming

886
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,240
from to me from this partner and not

887
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,580
using IPSec you think there might be

888
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,800
something fishy ongoing here so IPSec

889
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,690
somewhat helps but it's not a silver

890
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,850
bullet

891
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:54,350
so SMS routers and SMS home routing also

892
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,590
protects the energy okay you can still

893
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,330
do a fourth base station but it's a bit

894
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,310
more cumbersome front attacker so just

895
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,150
let's raise the threshold for my checkup

896
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,290
cooperation between operators some

897
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,480
operators are operating a very diverse

898
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,150
bunch so some of them are very security

899
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,820
Pro

900
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,700
if they share their results they see

901
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,950
successful countermeasures others are

902
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,290
not so active so it's important that

903
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,240
they share the experience on successful

904
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,970
what works what doesn't work so also

905
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,590
form circles of trust meaning for

906
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,170
example in countries where there's a

907
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,120
good legal basis and close cooperation

908
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,250
with legislators they can agree okay

909
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,670
that's what it means our note hardening

910
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,400
but to those guys we rent out those

911
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,790
other route of service and so on so in

912
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,970
u.s. the FCC looks into that issue of

913
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,000
the live TV heck they're formed a

914
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,770
special working group for this purpose

915
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,120
let's see what comes out of it so

916
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,360
prepare it's not important piece of the

917
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,040
puzzle so a checks are likely to come as

918
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,720
a seven the checks are real they are

919
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,520
just there I suppose

920
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,950
diameter attacks will come when ss7 gets

921
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,110
harder for an attacker or technology

922
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,900
just moves on in a major way so now is

923
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,910
the time to prepare for diameter tech

924
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,750
and that starts also with setting up

925
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,000
business rules you might wonder sort of

926
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,830
why we are talking about business rules

927
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,250
security cost money operators I usually

928
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,590
hope I shareholders if you ever try to

929
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,530
get money from shareholders or budget

930
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,930
from yourself a big security budget

931
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,270
allows you up for a challenge I tell you

932
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,430
that they are not known for altruism and

933
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,380
improving the world and privacy and so

934
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,930
that's not their core competence they

935
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,910
want to see the money so you must make a

936
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,860
case for them so you must sort of see

937
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,410
the fraud cases you must see when the

938
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,200
HSS going down or risks like that that

939
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,550
catches their attention because when

940
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,900
they lose money and they don't like

941
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,140
losing money so you need to sort of

942
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,540
investigate potential weaknesses and

943
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,550
their risk for the company because then

944
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,990
you can get the money for the security

945
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,410
so let's also part of the preparation so

946
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,360
it's important to investigate potential

947
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,580
weaknesses and countermeasures before

948
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:19,160
they happen and one other piece is

949
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,220
hardening of nodes its funds may be

950
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,020
stupid too people are used to internet

951
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,410
but

952
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,920
charcoal this is still not so automatic

953
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,440
as it is for normal internet nodes so

954
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,480
but there you can sort of argue with

955
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,160
quality of service and things like that

956
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,420
so prevent getting those GSMA and also

957
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,430
3gpp have done some very good work on

958
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,700
that and it's ongoing so things are

959
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,520
moving forward there but it's a long way

960
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,590
to go

961
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,610
so summary interconnection attacks they

962
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,100
are reality but the main text we see

963
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,440
today are focus on necessary diameter is

964
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,390
not yet so the fully on the radar of the

965
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,210
attacker but well SSM is lower hanging

966
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,840
proved it works so yeah all to the

967
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,820
interconnection most of them still using

968
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:14,790
map and diameter map and sa-7 so for a

969
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,550
checker as a seminal moment the

970
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,200
low-hanging fruit but things move

971
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,350
forward fully fluid attackers SE

972
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,570
diameter has similar functionality as

973
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,500
ss7 so hand similar texts are possible

974
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,030
not exactly the same as it's very

975
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,990
similar so we have seen for denial of

976
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,910
service attack one with a financial

977
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,820
fraud risk and one with it also has

978
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,000
netbook performance issues so the main

979
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,190
question will LTE face similar

980
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,950
interconnection weaknesses as a seven

981
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,440
and I'm associating that if you don't

982
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,570
take protection measures we are the same

983
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,110
method n so we need to do something so

984
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:59,360
it's not that security comes by itself

985
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,770
so mobile network you right from the

986
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,810
internet so let's protect them it's easy

987
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,880
to blame and say fix but it's really

988
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,380
hard to do the fixing so so I'd like to

989
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,810
thank you my audience

990
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,520
the finished our trust projects which

991
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,500
finance part of this research and the

992
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,930
major global operators for the support

993
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,460
and security engagement we are not a

994
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,620
large amazing name so I hope guys you

995
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,660
know thank you very much and you're

996
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,520
doing their job so thanks a lot

997
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:35,820
I think there's one question can you

998
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,410
stand up and speak louder that the other

999
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,640
can also hear you that you presented are

1000
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,990
coming from the influence so it's coming

1001
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:47,370
from my mobile the power or to whatever

1002
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,100
server unboxing T if I encrypted the

1003
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,590
communication between the mobile and the

1004
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,810
power I think I would be able to do the

1005
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,700
attacks coming from mining points on

1006
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,740
just increasing yeah you and Crypt Allah

1007
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,430
tilde your communications encrypted on

1008
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,350
the air interface which means from your

1009
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,090
phone to the antenna or to server

1010
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,480
depending on which point it doesn't

1011
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,020
matter if you encrypt so air interfaces

1012
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:17,010
because it's all you need

1013
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,740
yeah the authentication depends on the

1014
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,170
CPA and I K in your SIM card that's how

1015
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,970
the inter ticket education is done and

1016
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,280
it's running between your SIM card and

1017
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,260
your home subscriber net force is HSS

1018
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,300
box so my question is the problem

1019
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,280
because after an understanding of those

1020
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,200
deeper so than the problem so they will

1021
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,790
always even if I'm creating the

1022
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,830
connection I'll still be able to be sure

1023
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:45,780
to see receivable services it doesn't

1024
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,110
matter if you use IPSec it doesn't

1025
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,700
matter if you from from a user

1026
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,770
perspective use IPSec from your phone

1027
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,180
basically it doesn't matter in what

1028
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,830
phone you have or what device or what

1029
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,630
operating system it doesn't matter or

1030
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,520
because it's just an attack from the

1031
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,730
backend so so all it because of network

1032
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,310
has become information about you so and

1033
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:10,740
it handles you basically so that's all

1034
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,030
thanks any other question I think we

1035
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,160
have still time formal are there on the

1036
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:26,060
back yeah

1037
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:39,660
so the question was if the IPSec and

1038
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,799
3gpp basically uses its mandatory to use

1039
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:46,440
the certificate implementation wise we

1040
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,930
have to support the certificate variant

1041
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,619
but of course we can also implement

1042
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:54,420
variants for password but I think

1043
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,619
actually that will be outside of the

1044
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,839
standard I would need to check actually

1045
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,529
the NBS IP document but I'm pretty sure

1046
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:03,750
that the default is a certificate 1 and

1047
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,319
can be that the other option but I'm

1048
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,289
very sure that the certificate variant

1049
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:15,119
is the mandatory default so but its

1050
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:34,890
implementation not usage so you mean

1051
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,849
between the operator 1 operators and

1052
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:43,260
others it's it's a business decision

1053
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,990
actually it's done business contract so

1054
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,450
for example if you have this Apple has

1055
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,789
now this Apple term for example Apple

1056
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,829
doesn't have contracts with 200

1057
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:55,319
operators they have a contract with some

1058
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,630
service provider which has then in terms

1059
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,329
200 contract so it's very convenient

1060
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:01,710
from a business perspective because

1061
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,359
Apple system just need to take care of

1062
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,670
one contract and sort of outsources is

1063
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,440
that so that's a typical way how things

1064
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:22,799
are done yes can I launch the attack

1065
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,180
against your own you have the operator

1066
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,500
can I learn specific against your own

1067
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,289
users on or only if they are roaming and

1068
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:32,789
they are connected to another operator

1069
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:36,390
it doesn't make sense why would I need a

1070
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,220
third-party I will tell you though for a

1071
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,730
character particular feature

1072
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,230
this one is a user because position okay

1073
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:48,369
only party yes that depends so the

1074
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:50,170
question was sort of how the checks

1075
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,030
actually work at the network boundary

1076
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:56,770
for even operator so the checks an

1077
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,200
operator do at the network edge depends

1078
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,000
on the operator and how to configure the

1079
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,150
diameter edge agent it is in ss7 we saw

1080
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,670
cases where it was possible to send

1081
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,119
messages from the outside at saying you

1082
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:12,030
are the actually the home network

1083
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,369
necessary in these kind of cases so

1084
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,760
where this was possible and diameter

1085
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,720
that depends strongly on the

1086
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,350
configuration of the edge agent so but I

1087
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,390
agree doesn't make sense to disconnect

1088
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,840
your own user but it is not checked the

1089
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,090
message goes through and that's the

1090
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,619
point you need to configure these notes

1091
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:34,540
properly so that they kick out messages

1092
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,880
which don't make sense you need to sort

1093
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,369
of have some logic sort of use you and I

1094
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:41,590
we immediately see the message from is

1095
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,800
my Sander dress shouldn't come over the

1096
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,400
interconnect so but that's a note it

1097
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,290
just routes so you need to sort of

1098
00:51:50,290 --> 00:52:02,050
explain it to the world to out oh yeah

1099
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,119
when you roam you definitely sort of are

1100
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:05,590
a bit more exposed because then you are

1101
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,240
already another network and the network

1102
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,330
you connect to knows not that much about

1103
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,010
you you are sort of somewhat a foreigner

1104
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,950
to this network so so if you are in a

1105
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,660
home network you always have a bit is to

1106
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,340
the better protection than done roaming

1107
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,410
Network but just by the nature of the

1108
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:26,530
protocols here thanks okay thank you

1109
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,690
again I hope you enjoyed this brief

1110
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,580
introduction to tackle security
