1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,129
so hi everybody really nice to see you

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,650
this morning tomorrow today you're at

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,359
the ego market when greed for fame

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,799
benefits large scale botnets

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,679
presentation first we wanted to present

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,660
ourselves so my name is massara I'm a

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,639
cyber security researcher at Co secure

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,420
Inc I'm sort of the black sheep within

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,869
the research and development team at Co

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,029
secure cuz I'm the social scientist I've

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,760
got a economic background and a master

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,640
in criminology and also I'm the

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
treasurer of the North tech conference

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,790
which is an awesome conference that

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,530
takes place in Montreal he's going to

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,260
talk a bit more about that in a minute

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,219
hi I'm security researcher at secure I'm

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,870
in charge of the training session at

19
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,000
Lord set conference and competition so

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,219
just a shameless plug quickly about

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,379
North Side it's in Montreal beautiful

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,629
May 2017 it's a nonprofit organization

23
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,280
conference capture-the-flag competition

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,079
probably the largest on-site

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,430
capture-the-flag competition in the

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,460
world training awesome people and we are

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,140
looking for speakers so that's why their

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,060
shameless plug here thank you so much

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,869
for that just quickly we wanted to

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,189
present you the agenda of the

31
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,810
presentation you know you're in a

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,549
presentation where we'll talk about a

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,350
but net that conducts social media fraud

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,439
and we'll try to place it in its market

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,689
so quickly we'll go through and Linux

36
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,799
MOOCs which is the name of the botnet

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,320
recap I will show how we build our honey

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,200
pots for analysis will also represent

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
the man animal attack that we've done on

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,799
the butt net and then we'll go more on

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,509
the social side and talk about its

42
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,790
operation on social networks the buyers

43
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,009
who are they an overview of the seller

44
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,630
and we'll talk about the potential

45
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,229
potential profitability of the but net

46
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,670
this is a joint research between three

47
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,130
organization it's a good example of how

48
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,020
we can actually put all our skills

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,729
together so go secure ESET and

50
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,799
University of Montreal so I'll give the

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,479
forward to okay for the next 25 minutes

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,200
and we'll start yes well let's come back

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,890
to the next moves to have like a quick

54
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:09,000
recap on the podium all right so

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,520
Linux moose of course picture of a

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,150
Muenster

57
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,879
in a nutshell what it does is it affects

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,629
routers mostly but we now need to call

59
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,150
it Internet of Things devices

60
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,080
technically speaking without any

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,049
marketing you know buzzwords it's

62
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,599
actually embedded Linux systems with

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
busybox userland so this is what it

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,510
needs to affect it it has a worm like

65
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,560
behavior so it uses to spread telnet

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,459
credential brute force

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,799
so admin and min and min one two three

68
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,829
five and stuff like that is main payload

69
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,959
is proxy service so inside of ones

70
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,730
function in assembly it it supports

71
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,620
proxying traffic using sucks v4 v5 HTTP

72
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,680
and HTTPS pretty interesting how they

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,040
built it it's pretty nice and it's used

74
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,500
to proxy traffic to social media sites

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,629
so this was really a moment where we

76
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,920
were like well how why are they doing

77
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,579
that it's unclear so this was the first

78
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,280
time we did an analysis of it and the

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,900
what we'll present today is our

80
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,090
subsequent analysis of that but Annette

81
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,739
where we attacked and decrypted the

82
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,410
traffic the reason we needed to attack

83
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,299
button is that all of the traffic going

84
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,720
to the social media sites was encrypted

85
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,780
99% of it was over HTTP instead of HTTP

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,940
which meant that it was protected and

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,359
encrypted so quick recap of the timeline

88
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,389
it was discovered in November by ESET in

89
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,849
2014 I was working there at the time and

90
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,579
we totally reverse engineer it in early

91
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,919
2015

92
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,370
me and Tom @v we published a paper a few

93
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,199
months after the command and control

94
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,690
infrastructure went down it was taken

95
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,419
offline and in September 2015 a new

96
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,120
version was out that we collected in our

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,290
he the honeypot at ISA all of the really

98
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,510
gory and technical details are available

99
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,720
in the paper we published and

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,560
presentation we've done in the past so

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,048
we won't focus on the gory details for

102
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:16,459
now

103
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,060
so hey Linux moves well it comes from a

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,750
string alam which is present in the

105
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,070
binary file

106
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,290
ilan in French you can pronounce it

107
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,470
Allah and Allah is actually a moose in

108
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,950
in French so this is the like the

109
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,170
french-canadian I guess twist that we

110
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,880
could put to it and this is why we chose

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,830
that name after we published a paper

112
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,110
people told us you know the Internet is

113
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,180
nice you kind of crowdsource work a lot

114
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,740
of people tell you you're wrong and they

115
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,170
tell you why and so they told us no no

116
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,970
no no that's not for a moose that they

117
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,800
had this string in there it's because

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
they'll have old cars so they said it's

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,150
the Lots just the reason why it's that

120
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,150
this elan string was in there and then

121
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,370
other people from our company is set at

122
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,920
the time said no no no you got this

123
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,580
wrong that's this is about a Slovak

124
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,680
music group called Elim so the people

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,810
from Czech Republic or savatya know

126
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,490
about that band it's a rock band from

127
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,890
the 60s and they are still active right

128
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,330
now

129
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,580
so following assets' report which got

130
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,760
interesting media coverage the community

131
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,410
control infrastructure went dark as I

132
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,660
said until September 2015 and so this is

133
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,700
where we thought that it was an

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,280
opportunity to study Linux moves in a

135
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,260
broader sense so instead of just

136
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,480
publishing about the technical people at

137
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,940
the technical portion and the network

138
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,220
protocol that it used and you know your

139
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,740
typical malware analysis with either

140
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,870
screenshots and stuff like that we

141
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,840
decided to take a step back and try to

142
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
study the market and this is where I

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,340
this is like kind of at the time where I

144
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,210
met massara

145
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,180
who we met at a scientific conference in

146
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,940
Canada and I was like oh someone like

147
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,100
that can definitely benefit research

148
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,490
like this if she can you know do some

149
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,380
statistical analysis and more in-depth

150
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,060
you know trying to understand the market

151
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,310
and talk about it in scientific and

152
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,800
economic words stuff that I couldn't do

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
by myself so since I wanted to study

154
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,470
Linux moves again we needed to catch it

155
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,990
so we needed to catch the version to the

156
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,330
of course the changes they made made it

157
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,580
made the work to catch it more

158
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,740
complicated to us because they were able

159
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,950
to adapt to the report that we've

160
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,520
published so to catch them what we did

161
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,930
is we built a

162
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,300
is software based instead of hardware

163
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,100
based so it's easy to deploy in the

164
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,340
cloud cheaper the only disadvantage is

165
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,410
that it easy to fingerprint a software

166
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,690
based honeypot we use the low

167
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,600
interaction honeypot the reason why is

168
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,310
everything is simulated so it's less

169
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,290
dangerous if you deploy a high

170
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,030
interaction on a pot and they are

171
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,740
compromised people can use them to

172
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,180
attack the internet and you're kind of

173
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,190
part of the problem if you use low

174
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,020
interaction you can kind of control what

175
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,210
is emulated or not requires less

176
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,000
monitoring we side-loaded

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,970
an emulation with our virtual machine

178
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,010
which we infected so we had the real

179
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,110
malware running instead of a fake client

180
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,720
or something like that so we really were

181
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,570
running the real payload the

182
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,370
architecture in a nutshell is the

183
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,650
following so you can see on the left

184
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,710
hand side the the arm emulator that we

185
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,740
use this qmu we use the debian arm image

186
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,870
and we put Atlanta the binary in there

187
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,450
on the right hand side it's the Kerry

188
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,830
honeypot that which shows the low

189
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,230
interaction on a pot we emulated a

190
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,820
router userland so the filesystem

191
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,000
mimicked really a real world with it we

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,330
aimed for has a busybox environment and

193
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,960
a telnet service now come back about the

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,930
network portion a bit later so why did

195
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,360
we choose Kerry we chose that because it

196
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,860
was written patent and twisted which

197
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,860
were familiar familiar to us as I said

198
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,780
it we could emulate a full file system

199
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,700
and the output of commands to mimic a

200
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,070
really a consumer router exactly the

201
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,140
target that we have in mind it was

202
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,600
actively maintained compared to the

203
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,060
previous version which carry is based on

204
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,250
which is called keepo which was no

205
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,430
longer maintained easy to modify since

206
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,000
it was in Python it has machine parsable

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,590
loves this is important when you deploy

208
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,720
you know 20 honeypot and you you have

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
not a lot of time to look at them you

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,710
need something to be able to query the

211
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,870
logs quickly and have relevant output

212
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,610
stuff you're interested in has a

213
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,919
real-time log replay which is really

214
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,690
cool because you can see if the attacker

215
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,430
or the people interacting with your

216
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,090
honeypot

217
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,520
you can see if they are a machine a

218
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,770
script or a human because you see the

219
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,810
typos you see that the back spaces you

220
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,170
see

221
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,230
in real-time so it's really interesting

222
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,030
mechanism the only problem is which was

223
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,950
pretty big for us it it has no telnet

224
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,800
support so we know that our worm uses

225
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,960
return net or relies on telnet so what

226
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,120
we decided to do is we decided I looked

227
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,130
at calories architecture and we decided

228
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,170
to contribute telnet support to carry I

229
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,650
was able to figure out how to reuse most

230
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,100
of the that terminal emulation and all

231
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,780
of the complicated stuff that Cahuilla

232
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,330
already implemented and just hook telnet

233
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,730
at the same spot that they hooked ssh

234
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,270
and have it all work it sounds a lot

235
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,100
more easy and it actually was and this

236
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,750
is mostly due because twisted is really

237
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,300
complicated and because VT virtual

238
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,850
terminal emulation is also complex but

239
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,730
it's still a matter of a few days of

240
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,430
they weren't that much now I'm happy to

241
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,400
say that the upstream project so Michael

242
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,150
who is in charge of the project he

243
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,640
integrated our telnet support to the the

244
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,770
curry upstream project so now everyone

245
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,520
can use carry to you know attract IOT

246
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,300
style mile malware moving on to the

247
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,480
other honeypot components the infected

248
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,160
host that we had on the left-hand side

249
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,440
of the architecture diagram is running

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,610
qmu as I mentioned we use our l's debian

251
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,220
linux arm images we planted the linux

252
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,720
moose by name in there and then we ran

253
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,880
it so how do we attach all of these

254
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,100
components together is through firewall

255
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,040
rules so we use IP tables to send the

256
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,530
net piece to the arlo interaction

257
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,830
honeypot on the right hand side and we

258
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,840
use the IP tables rules to redirect the

259
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,450
HTTP and the proxy traffic to a

260
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,910
man-in-the-middle proxy service which

261
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm about to talk about and the whole

262
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,630
thing again you know I'm kind of if you

263
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,120
can get gather all the traffic gather it

264
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,580
so I we added a dump cap which is part

265
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,700
of Wireshark to just grab the caps of

266
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,100
the whole thing all the interactions so

267
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,700
yeah about the man-in-the-middle proxies

268
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,089
component we needed to attack

269
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,769
next moves as I said earlier in order to

270
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,740
strip the the HTTP traffic and have

271
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,050
access to the raw traffic in order to

272
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,459
really understand how they were

273
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,319
performing the fraud and if it was

274
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:19,430
working so removing BS from HTTP the

275
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,499
meta meta data itself was interesting

276
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,540
but we wanted to see the fake profiles

277
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,029
and the potential buyers and to be able

278
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:26,930
to document them

279
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,319
so before we on the first version of our

280
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,389
analysis we were still able to know that

281
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,569
it was going to social media sites

282
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,800
because we had access to the

283
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,139
certificates which was which send as

284
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,930
part of HTTP so we looked at the common

285
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,569
name in the x.509 certificates and we're

286
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,189
about to say oh this is going to

287
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:47,959
Facebook this is going to Instagram this

288
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,379
is going to YouTube but it's again as I

289
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,059
said this was only metadata so it

290
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:56,120
limited what we can study so I'm about

291
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,699
to explain a little bit how we perform

292
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:01,309
the attack so as you can see here this

293
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,589
is how the bots are relaying traffic

294
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,579
without us interfering with it so the

295
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,220
there is an end-to-end TCP connection

296
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,160
from the proxy client to the but the

297
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,339
infected host proxy client is actually

298
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,139
the operators we don't really know how

299
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,240
they're you know how they operate at

300
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,889
there and so we just called it

301
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,110
generically proxy client but we could

302
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,149
have written operators or you know but

303
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:29,600
masters so TCP connection from them to

304
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,759
the affected host and then it starts

305
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,230
again from the infected host to the

306
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,410
targeted social network but this is so

307
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,779
this is two TCP connections but sucks

308
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,429
tunnel this is the proxy component

309
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,889
actually you know it creates an

310
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,679
end-to-end tunnel between the operators

311
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,449
and the targeted social network and

312
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,589
inside that tunnel the HTTP traffic is

313
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,730
is tolerant because of the the traffic

314
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,309
is tunneled from end to end to the

315
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:01,189
social network that HTTPS is encrypted

316
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,740
and authenticated so it you know from

317
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,069
them it's like like anyone would use on

318
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,050
a browser going to Facebook or stuff

319
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,379
like that it's conventional connection

320
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,879
so what we did for the attack is we

321
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,860
inserted a man-in-the-middle attack

322
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,809
component after the effect of the host

323
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,950
so we terminate

324
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,070
the socks proxy so you still have to TCP

325
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,160
connections from the client to the

326
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,839
infected host and from the infected host

327
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,269
to the targeted social network but the

328
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:31,130
search process eternal is terminated in

329
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,870
our man in the middle attack component

330
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,230
and so we terminate the HTTP at the same

331
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,560
time and we and it is recreated on the

332
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,170
other side with the social network so

333
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,750
there are kind of two flavor of purple

334
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,660
here the lightish one means that since

335
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,269
we inject and terminate the connection

336
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,910
the HTTP connection we need to provide a

337
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,670
certificate and wait so we need we

338
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,310
decided or we use a tool that will sign

339
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,440
that certificate with a CA that is

340
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,230
generated by us which means that the

341
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,720
connection is encrypted but it's not

342
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,170
authenticated they if a real use

343
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,899
end-user browser would would be doing

344
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:15,079
the the traffic that carrying the

345
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,940
information they would get a certificate

346
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,250
error because they don't trust our our

347
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,310
CA our certificate authority so this is

348
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,930
where we kind of needed to cross our

349
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,610
fingers and hope for the best that it

350
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,620
was automated and that they were they

351
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,510
didn't care about the security of the

352
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,339
other thing but we added a little

353
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,360
component or we try to tip the luck in

354
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,490
our in our side as you'll see in a

355
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,750
second so the darker purple is a real

356
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,760
you know authenticated and encrypted

357
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,800
channel from our man the middle

358
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,459
component to the targeted social network

359
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,230
so how we mounted the attack the attack

360
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,829
is we redirected the HTTP and HTTP to

361
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,600
the man-in-the-middle process using IP

362
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,870
tables we avoided trapping the CNC the

363
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,750
government control traffic because it is

364
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,269
HTTP so we needed to set that aside

365
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,420
again using IP table rules we crafted a

366
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,040
certificate authority and we cross our

367
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,680
fingers so that certificate authority we

368
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,560
decided to mimic a TLS inspection

369
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,170
appliance so we figured these guys since

370
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,000
they are infecting the whole internet

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
you know with they must see a lot of

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,639
stuff out there in the wild so we

373
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,269
decided let's take an own product who is

374
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,960
doing TLS interception mimic that

375
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,940
certificate and hope for the best that

376
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,649
they already saw something like that in

377
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,330
the wild and that it was oh yeah this is

378
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,430
a security appliance we still want to

379
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,380
infect that that device at first it

380
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,670
failed but because we used better cap

381
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,550
instead of what the component we decided

382
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,060
to use on first we for better cap we

383
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,020
needed to remove the HSTs bypass so HSTs

384
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,570
is HTP trick to prevent view from light

385
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,029
like to avoid the the the fact that you

386
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,850
you first connect to a service in a non

387
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,880
HTTPS way so we needed to bypass that

388
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,480
because it's HSTs bypass relied on dns

389
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,420
and due to the nature of the Sox

390
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,459
proxying we didn't have access to the

391
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,190
DNS traffic to tamper it so it couldn't

392
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,260
work in the environment we patched it

393
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,720
but still after that it used a lot of

394
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,820
resources it's seg faulted but the most

395
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,560
important reason why better cap didn't

396
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,990
work in our context is because the it

397
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,360
didn't produce machine possible locks so

398
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,339
there was no way for us to do a really

399
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,089
high level analysis of tens of thousands

400
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,209
of HTTP connection it was we would have

401
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,589
to parse you know complex text in order

402
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,260
to extract meaningful of information so

403
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,820
what we did in the end is we tried

404
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,470
another tool which is madmen in the

405
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,480
middle proxy ran it in transparent mode

406
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,030
transparent proxy mode sorry and it has

407
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,439
been really stable and running for

408
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:05,800
months

409
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,720
and has a library to parse locks so that

410
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,910
their logs are in a machine format and

411
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,699
it provide a really high level you know

412
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,189
get URL stuff interface library in

413
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:20,800
Python which is really good so with this

414
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,099
and our fake certificate mimicking net

415
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,400
appliance we were able to succeed so

416
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,300
what we think is that the operators

417
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,800
disregarded the certificate error they

418
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,230
probably use a library or automation

419
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,240
tool that has the checks disabled by

420
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,929
default or the the had it enabled from

421
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,669
the beginning but they faced too many

422
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,290
you know problems with it and they just

423
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,280
decided

424
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,460
hey we don't care we we like we don't we

425
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,130
just want more you know traffic we don't

426
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,990
mind if there is one or two error here

427
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,740
or there so this is this was good for us

428
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,260
and it's most likely because it was

429
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,200
automated so at this point we were like

430
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,840
yes we have access to the unencrypted

431
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,880
social media traffic proxy through the

432
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,330
botnet and now that massara

433
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,610
continue a little bit with that just a

434
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,160
little bit yeah so we're at right

435
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,780
because it's a process in our research

436
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,750
that we follow we've got now oops sorry

437
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,270
several infected hosts actively used by

438
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,520
a botnet operators we've got HTTP

439
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,440
traffic in plain oh you don't see what I

440
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,410
see right okay we got HTTP traffic in

441
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,010
plain text

442
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,110
we've got CNC traffic and while we were

443
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,000
doing that I also went online and it's

444
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
an open source research so we've got as

445
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,230
well publicly available seller market

446
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,150
because it's openly sold so I gathered

447
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,950
lots of data on the prices and the

448
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,570
quantity that were sold on social media

449
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,950
fraud so yeah our findings or the whole

450
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,960
research that we did can be summarized

451
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,970
around five features and we want to

452
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,320
present them through those five features

453
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,260
to like be structured but so Linux most

454
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,000
is sort of involved in a clever scheme

455
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,490
that's stealthy constantly adapting

456
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,190
creates no direct victims is hiding in

457
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,720
plain sight and has a large potential

458
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,370
profitability so we'll go through all

459
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,120
those five characteristics and we'll do

460
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,520
this in parallel the sort of market

461
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,370
analysis I'll give back Jody GA for two

462
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,200
of the first two features at the micro

463
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,060
and then I'll go Michael yep so the two

464
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,800
first two features she described are

465
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,660
more maybe technical so that's why I'll

466
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,930
cover them quickly so why we think it's

467
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,530
stealthy it's because it has no x86

468
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,350
version so I've been studying IOT

469
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,820
malware for two years and I never saw

470
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,640
except for for from for Linux moves IOT

471
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,460
malware that didn't have an x86 version

472
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,530
the reason is like you know the they

473
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,910
have their C code then they have their

474
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,860
cross compiler set up done so why not

475
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,950
have an x86 version the problem or why

476
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,320
it stopped T to not have an x86 version

477
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,020
is because all of the industry's best to

478
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,220
and mines are around x86 the telemetry

479
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,710
you know from AV company all of the

480
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,510
products everything is you know

481
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,820
targeting like Ida Pro is really a lot

482
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,640
better at reverse engineering x86 then

483
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,740
arm arm support is getting there but I

484
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,770
mean moose is principal what I most

485
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,040
worked on was a mixed version so has no

486
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,590
the compiler for MIPS and stuff like

487
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,590
that so this is kind of them avoiding to

488
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,809
infect servers and honey pots which are

489
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,470
usually also x86 there's no ad fraud

490
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,510
DDoS or spam which was really unusual

491
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,150
for us to see something like that so

492
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,059
really focused on this social media you

493
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,820
know proxying stuff and it has no

494
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,760
persistent mechanism so the reason we

495
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,670
think it's stealthy is because let's say

496
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,679
your grandmother has a router and she

497
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,990
needs to reboot her router from time to

498
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,540
time because you know the the infection

499
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,910
makes the router crash or out of memory

500
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,490
and we saw that in the in the past like

501
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,980
they were updating them our to remove or

502
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,950
add out of memory checks in it so we

503
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,660
know that they had you know memory

504
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,580
leakage problems or they had you know

505
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,740
the infected really low memory systems

506
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,860
and it and it didn't work there so let's

507
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,929
say your grandmother's router is

508
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,760
crashing from time to time or her

509
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,890
internet is not working well while shiru

510
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,470
she will reboot the router if there are

511
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,630
if the malware has persistent she would

512
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,490
reboot the router and then it would fail

513
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,020
again and then she would reboot the

514
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,370
router again and at some point she would

515
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,929
get tired and troll the thing away and

516
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:37,660
buy a new router which will have not

517
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,929
have done it exposed by default and

518
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:43,030
therefore credentials we hope but the

519
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,850
industries is better than it is actually

520
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,770
in that regard so it shouldn't have done

521
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,780
it exposed and so this is why we think

522
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,870
there's no person mechanism if you the

523
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,970
great-grandmother in question removes

524
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,740
the router and it's not and it's working

525
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,650
fine for a few weeks then for her it's

526
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,480
just normal because of the lack of

527
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,700
persistence but you have to remember

528
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,160
that the infected her router because of

529
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,290
weak down that credential exposed so

530
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,850
they will always come back from the same

531
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,060
door it's just that instead of

532
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,100
constantly having her reboot it will be

533
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,740
every several weeks and which will which

534
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,720
is enough for them to you know operate

535
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,830
so this is why we think it's stealthy

536
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,830
technique for us to stay under the radar

537
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,510
now constantly that thing this is more

538
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,030
about the changes that are were

539
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,370
implemented after he sets rapport so

540
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,480
what they did is the Covenant control IP

541
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,730
address in the for the first version was

542
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,280
hard-coded in the binary which is not a

543
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,890
good thing because if you do any type of

544
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,990
hunting on virustotal if you have access

545
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,300
to the files through sharing between the

546
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,540
AV vendors you have the command control

547
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,650
infrastructure you know where it is and

548
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,570
you can go after it so what they did is

549
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,700
instead it's provided via the common

550
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,030
line when it is performing the infection

551
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,570
and so since they also didn't want

552
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,670
people just running honeypot to have the

553
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,420
IP address in plain text they decided to

554
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,460
obfuscate it so it's packed as an

555
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,680
integer instead of a string and it

556
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,050
soared with a constant value a four byte

557
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,200
value which is again you can find

558
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,270
through reverse engineering but this

559
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,790
means that you need to have the binary

560
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,390
file and you need to have to actually

561
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,340
witness an infection in order to have a

562
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,820
command control IP address of course the

563
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,370
proxy service port changed so this was a

564
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,100
hard-coded port really easy to filter at

565
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,200
the ISP level you know in a stateless

566
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,480
way a port like that which is from the

567
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,020
first version it was ten thousand and 73

568
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,030
second version is twenty thousand and

569
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,150
twelve so they just changed it you know

570
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,210
say so that anyone looking at that port

571
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,480
traffic for socks proxy traffic could

572
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,220
couldn't find it anymore

573
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,410
they also updated the but waiting

574
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,600
process so this is a small change that

575
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
they did on the command and control

576
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,780
infrastructure side where the the the

577
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,420
infection needs to be actually performed

578
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,220
by another Linux moose instance

579
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,070
otherwise you won't receive jobs after

580
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,900
you are successfully hooked on the

581
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,470
command and control you know protocol so

582
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,270
this is just a simple way for them to

583
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:24,970
just

584
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,830
make sure that there's less researchers

585
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,190
that are after them they also updated

586
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,760
their HTTP protocol so now it used to be

587
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,760
8 on port 80 but it was raw binary so if

588
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,860
you would hit the the IP address with a

589
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,500
browser you would get you know garbage

590
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,120
but now what they did is they wrapped it

591
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,580
inside an HTTP looking protocol and that

592
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,159
by net the old binary exchange is done

593
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,370
inside set cookie and cookie headers so

594
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,080
now it's really looking like a

595
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,289
legitimate web server and if you hit it

596
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:59,470
with a browser you you get the famous it

597
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,419
works page it's like and you know an

598
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:04,330
unsettled but if you look at the header

599
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,820
the network traffic you see set cookie

600
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,710
which means that and this is where they

601
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,570
encode it and instead of encoding the

602
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,640
binary in base64 or something like that

603
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,789
they just do a very you know basic and

604
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:19,960
and strange like most malware plus plus

605
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,570
65 to make sure that it's in the ascii

606
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,350
range and i do it will not blow up the

607
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,309
the HTTP protocol or spec so this is why

608
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:31,840
we say it's constantly adapting it

609
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,780
changes just as little as it needed to

610
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,700
be able to stay under the radar and

611
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,830
avoid researchers attention and I'm

612
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,440
pretty sure that after this talk

613
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,610
unfortunately we will have a same

614
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,559
problem and we'll have to go back at

615
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,669
them again because they will have

616
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,900
changed this stuff we mentioned yeah I

617
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,390
in fact I should have plugged that here

618
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,230
I forgot

619
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,409
ESET did a blog post this week about the

620
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:58,600
technical changes so in more detail this

621
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,400
is just a slide with no code they have

622
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,700
code they have updated IO C's and all

623
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,080
that good stuff so you should definitely

624
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,220
go and check check that so the next the

625
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,080
last stretch is massara

626
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,570
who is going to share her her our

627
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,549
findings or her findings so the third

628
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:21,669
feature was hi know Larrick victims and

629
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:23,440
we'll just go through the analysis and

630
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,880
you understand why we say that but

631
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,650
what's with social media fraud because

632
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,990
we often say that but like it's not it's

633
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,280
the process of creating false

634
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,169
endorsements of social networks accounts

635
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:36,909
in order to enhance the users popular G

636
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:37,660
popularity

637
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,700
invisibility we came up with that

638
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,530
definition but it's mostly just creating

639
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,390
fake follows and fake likes online so

640
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,490
you go into Instagram create fake

641
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,750
accounts and just go and like other

642
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,290
people right and when we have the the

643
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,930
traffic decrypted then I could analyze

644
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,870
it and what we did is mostly just having

645
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,340
an overview of where the traffic is

646
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,140
going from Lennox moves and we found

647
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,520
that that it's mostly going through

648
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,680
Instagram and it's going to Instagram

649
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,420
through all honeypot so we had many of

650
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,980
them and they could have focused on

651
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,480
different social networks but the thing

652
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,370
is they're all focusing on Instagram and

653
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,810
doing a bit more on other social

654
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,660
networks they're doing a person ish on

655
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,370
Twitter and then there is periscope

656
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,770
flipagram and qee which are really sort

657
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,450
of unknown social networks that we'll

658
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,420
talk a bit more later but yeah mostly

659
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,820
focused on Instagram and what does it do

660
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,040
on Instagram it performs likes and

661
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,140
follows but it's only 13% of its

662
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,050
activity so 87 percent of its activity

663
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,990
is actually a walk through creating a

664
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,000
fake like or fake follow so that's quite

665
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
interesting because it shows us that the

666
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,480
button that still needs to work out and

667
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,910
sort of try to look legitimate inhuman

668
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,910
and doing requests that will look like a

669
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,980
human is browsing through Instagram so

670
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,990
we found various modus operandi and

671
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,670
please don't focus on that love text I

672
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,230
know we're not supposed to put that up

673
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,690
so I just give you here an example of a

674
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,270
modus operandi we can call of 15

675
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,680
requests that the button it's gonna do

676
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,200
before creating a like or follow so

677
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,300
we'll go through it will log into its

678
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,130
fake account and then we'll go visit its

679
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,680
inbox which is always empty right LLL go

680
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,390
and look for the initial recipients to

681
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,010
send a message it'll visits its own

682
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,320
personal timeline it'll go and visit the

683
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,390
the profile of the person it's planning

684
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,000
on actually liking the fake the fade

685
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,040
they like fake liking the account if I

686
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,350
could say so we found like various

687
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,390
mother super Andy it ranged from like

688
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,130
shorter ones to longer ones to actually

689
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,370
avoid being flagged as spam by Instagram

690
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,280
and that actually worked the success

691
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,470
rate of Linux moves creating fake likes

692
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,660
and fake follows it's almost 90 percent

693
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,640
so in ninety percent of the time they're

694
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,650
fine and Instagram doesn't flag them and

695
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,480
they created fake likes and a fake

696
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,390
follow and they monetize it in eleven

697
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,070
percent of the time or we actually see

698
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,960
Instagram flagging it and saying we're

699
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,800
against spam

700
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
you've got problem for us to stop your

701
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,150
request please contact support so still

702
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,190
we don't know how they're like flagging

703
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,040
11% and letting go 89% but they're still

704
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,150
small flagging me but you know what it's

705
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,920
nice because the follows it's not nice

706
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,050
it's the photos they don't actually last

707
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,660
so what we see is they're putting a my

708
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,190
good they're putting a lot of effort

709
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,140
into creating fake likes and fake

710
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,640
follows but they're not putting any

711
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,700
efforts into keeping them online so here

712
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,320
I give you an example of a fake account

713
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,350
it has 0 posts it has one follower

714
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,500
because and it's it's following actually

715
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,230
262 people and sometimes it goes up to

716
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,140
800 people it always has some Gordon

717
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,210
boring pictures of either a building a

718
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,550
plant or an animal and we try to look if

719
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,750
we could like sort of trace back the

720
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,220
pictures but it's probably playing with

721
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,530
the pixels because we couldn't but in

722
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,120
the end you know it just it looks like a

723
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,250
but it's not hard to be to say that's a

724
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,110
but and Instagram is actually flying

725
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,400
them often so of the 1750 counts that we

726
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,790
saw going through the traffic when we

727
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,730
went on Instagram and of August 2016 so

728
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,860
that's six months after having honeypot

729
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,100
starting well 72% of seventy-two percent

730
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,050
of them were suspended and didn't exist

731
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,050
anymore so what does that mean well it

732
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,910
means that buyers are getting ripped off

733
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,410
they're buying for fake likes and fake

734
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,760
follows but in the end they're not

735
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,500
they're it's not a quality service and

736
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,210
even though they get it like right away

737
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,130
when they buy it it's not gonna last and

738
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,740
they're not gonna be famous online

739
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,220
anymore in a few weeks or a few months

740
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,570
but talking about the buyers right who

741
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,400
are they because what's great about the

742
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,230
traffic that we had is that we could see

743
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,990
to whom to which profile the new expose

744
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,730
was actually creating fake follows and

745
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,140
fake likes so we could see the potential

746
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,380
buyers so we we went on with a

747
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,080
methodology that I'll refined for future

748
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,180
articles but the whole idea I was to

749
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,640
first look at profiles on which fellows

750
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,370
were performed by the nooks moves go and

751
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,230
see active profiles that were owned by

752
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,170
people or enterprises businesses that

753
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,940
had either lots of followers that's not

754
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,520
the main point it's mostly that when

755
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
they posted pictures there was no

756
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,880
reaction so their idea is if you you've

757
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,350
got a million followers and you post a

758
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,540
really nice picture and two people react

759
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,160
then it just shows you that you probably

760
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,920
have a million fake followers right so I

761
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,960
give you an example here of a designer

762
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,110
they've get 150,000 followers and they

763
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,670
post pictures and they're actually

764
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,670
having like 25 people reacting to it so

765
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,090
the ratio is really low and analyzing

766
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,490
those buyers potential buyers created

767
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,230
sort of three large categories that can

768
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,360
be overlapping a bit but that gives you

769
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,860
a great overview of who are the people

770
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,680
action by but net services right so you

771
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,930
firstly get business related accounts so

772
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,690
we saw lots of accounts on which there

773
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,550
would be a description like this one I

774
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,350
don't know if you see it but it's got 16

775
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,230
thousand followers it's an electronic

776
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,000
cigarette business and in all the

777
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,820
descriptions you'll have a link to their

778
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,900
websites where you could actually go and

779
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:58,170
boy we found lots of watches and jewels

780
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,670
clothes shoes all those businesses that

781
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,010
are existing only online and some of

782
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,630
them look quite shady so you don't

783
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,070
really know if actually you're gonna get

784
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,950
the product you get shipped or not but

785
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,410
still so yeah there was mostly online

786
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,180
there was a few as well that there were

787
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,860
some sort of small businesses that

788
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,330
existed physically like your a

789
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,940
restaurant in Kuwait or a pizza shop in

790
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,070
Bali so those people would actually

791
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,360
start some of those businesses as well

792
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,160
we saw as well let's business related

793
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,840
accounts so it's it's a business but

794
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,370
it's mostly self-centered and that may

795
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,140
be a result of the Instagram social

796
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,950
network it's mostly people that well

797
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,750
here sorry I've got an example it's a

798
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,230
guy he's a web developer but and he's

799
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,760
calling for projects and his profile

800
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,380
description which I plucked because if

801
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,940
you wrote that profile description on

802
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,610
Google you'd find it right away but he's

803
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,990
calling for projects and everything but

804
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,700
most of his profile is focused on his

805
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,740
wealth and he's a coolness I guess and

806
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,570
he's got a million followers a million

807
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,000
people following him those

808
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,130
business-related accounts were like

809
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,560
really sorry centered around individual

810
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,680
we saw lots of hair designer web dev

811
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,950
vlog Barry TV presenters and alike in

812
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,250
tattooist yeah and finally we had those

813
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,840
aspiring celebrities so those people are

814
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,590
trying to break in showbiz but probably

815
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,850
it's harder

816
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,530
yeah it's harder to break in the Soviets

817
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,690
so they're trying to give themselves a

818
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,230
bit of legitimacy here's a singer he's

819
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,940
got thirty to thirty thousand followers

820
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,130
but we found lots of model actors like

821
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,040
all of them there so those are like the

822
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,870
three large categories that mostly

823
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,670
Center on celebrities Fame online and

824
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,260
there was also some of overlapping

825
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,900
groups that I just gave an example here

826
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,740
but it's mostly focused on ego and I had

827
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,300
to blur lots of things to be adequate

828
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,600
for blackhat but you see it's it's

829
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,460
mostly what I looked for like two months

830
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,050
trying to look at the buyers and it's

831
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,720
always what came up was mostly people

832
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,550
posting themselves and it was maybe

833
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,720
business-related because they are

834
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,930
bodybuilders or a web developer up there

835
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,790
but in the end you're just not sure what

836
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,980
exactly it's all about my favorite was

837
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,600
the one on the top corner there who was

838
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,070
actually chained chilling out with his

839
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:18,070
Mac in the water so yeah so is this an

840
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,440
ego market and it's our third researcher

841
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,659
that came out with the name well it's

842
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,850
pretty much what we think it is and I

843
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,860
gave him you a picture here of I think

844
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,510
it's an actress Selena Gomez she's

845
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,429
taking a picture of herself in front of

846
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,770
people who should take pictures of her

847
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,310
and we've got to the left hand side our

848
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,360
Prime Minister Canadian Prime Minister

849
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,460
Justin Trudeau who's well known for

850
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,199
actually taking pictures of himself and

851
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,840
taking pictures pretty much so yeah so

852
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,670
let's come back to our feature we say

853
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,440
social media fraud creating no direct

854
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,760
victims it's in the end that it's so

855
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,320
peculiar and it's just creating fake

856
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,700
find them online right no one's actually

857
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,380
getting hurt it's not ransomware there's

858
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,750
no law enforcement going after that but

859
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,550
there still die in their victims we

860
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,110
could say it's those that get fooled by

861
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,410
false popularity so you can think of all

862
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,240
those bars are hiring that singer

863
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,740
thinking he's really popular and in the

864
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,290
end no one's coming to drink or those

865
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,970
advertising companies are actually bored

866
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,620
lots of advertisements but in the end

867
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,270
won't get the visibility thing to hear

868
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,370
they have they could have but who's

869
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,350
gonna sort of complain for advertising

870
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,300
companies right it's some part of the

871
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,070
deal and the next most wolf I'd say but

872
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,720
masters when they create that and

873
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,460
money often well they're selling it to

874
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,950
common people and those common people

875
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,359
are actually getting their service and

876
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,890
they're selling it through legitimate

877
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,960
credit cards so they're probably even

878
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,270
doing their taxes saying they do social

879
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,800
marketing who wouldn't believe you make

880
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,170
money by doing social marketing right so

881
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,570
if they're actually making the money by

882
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,609
selling to common people without ripping

883
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,410
them well they are but they're still

884
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,040
providing the service and the sellers

885
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,840
right so as I said earlier I went to I

886
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,550
went to websites and I looked at where

887
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,400
you could buy and boy fake fame and boy

888
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,930
fake followers and it's really easy you

889
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,760
go on google or right boy fake followers

890
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,930
and they'll just come right away and

891
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,340
there's like to me ins websites selling

892
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,570
that so we said that d'oeuvre feature is

893
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,040
sort of they're hiding in plain sight

894
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,750
right they're not selling their product

895
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,280
in underground forums they're selling it

896
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,230
to common people up on the clear web and

897
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,550
yeah so they're selling it to clear up

898
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,070
so I gave here is an example of a

899
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,980
website that we can find really easily

900
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,990
online and what's interesting is that

901
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,460
because when we were doing the data

902
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,410
opens service guy gathering we didn't

903
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,119
know that Linux Mo's was focusing on

904
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,369
Instagram because we didn't have the

905
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,720
unencrypted traffic so I gathered

906
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,460
information on all social networks and

907
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,470
you can see that most of those websites

908
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,330
they offer a social media fraud on

909
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,220
Twitter Facebook Google+ YouTube Vimeo

910
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,109
link then Pinterest tumblr Instagram

911
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:57,790
like all of them it exists on all social

912
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,310
networks and they they're doing a bit of

913
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,170
social engineering trying to look at

914
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,700
make it look legitimate so they're

915
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,280
trying to show how normal it is to buy

916
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,900
fake fame so they'll talk about its

917
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,250
social marketing and it'll give

918
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,130
consumers support and consumers feedback

919
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,570
and they'll say how its normal to

920
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,339
actually have followers and it's

921
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:17,619
important and so yeah they're doing a

922
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,050
bit of social engineering to let people

923
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,470
like come and boy and thing it's normal

924
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,330
most of the prices they are in price

925
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,830
bundles and here I just gives you an

926
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,380
example and it's for Instagram followers

927
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,030
so you go from a hundred followers to

928
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,220
five thousand five thousand follow five

929
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,830
five hundred thousand followers and it's

930
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,630
always instant delivery guaranteed

931
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,820
quality hundred percent safe and yeah I

932
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,800
did this small graph here just because

933
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,480
we had

934
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,020
of the prices for 10,000 follows on each

935
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,369
social networks we have a database of

936
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,740
about 5000 prices and as you can see

937
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,050
LinkedIn is the most expensive one if

938
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,020
you want to avoid 10,000 follows on that

939
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,000
social network then it will be 700 bucks

940
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,280
and I will buy like I wouldn't pay that

941
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,079
much but then you get Google Plus

942
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,270
Facebook and Twitter and in the end

943
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,730
Instagram is the cheaper one it may be

944
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,990
the cheaper one because there's lots of

945
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,240
supply or because it's easier to do

946
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,430
social media fell on that or maybe there

947
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,839
because they're more competition in

948
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,790
between the buttons I don't know and

949
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,980
here's a small example of the prices on

950
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,079
Instagram and like I highlighted the

951
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,339
10th 10,000 follows which is 112 dollars

952
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,890
for 10,000 follows and you see next to

953
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,140
it the standard deviation it's it's to

954
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,460
show you how much the prices can vary

955
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,250
through websites so here it's a hundred

956
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,650
bucks so it means that you can have

957
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,619
actually 10,000 follows for about 12

958
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,480
bucks or you can have 10,000 follows for

959
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,670
about 200 bucks and it shows that the

960
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,440
prices varies a lot in between websites

961
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,569
and usually when we have prices are

962
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:53,819
really close to each other that that do

963
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:55,140
not vary a lot we say that it's a

964
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,250
competitive market because they're

965
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,410
trying to grab market shares but the

966
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,579
fact that you know the prices are

967
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,260
varying doesn't seem that doesn't mean

968
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,270
that it's an uncompetitive market it

969
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,369
means that it's probably an immature one

970
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:06,930
so when you want and people don't know

971
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,270
how much the service is worth so the

972
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,040
sellers are actually either over pricing

973
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,359
or under pricing because they don't know

974
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,430
what there was the worth of this their

975
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,319
sales and the buyers not know exactly

976
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,790
what's worth so they're trying to serve

977
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,829
in between the prices like getting them

978
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,270
do the ones gonna probably less rip them

979
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:28,050
off right so here's a little story so

980
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,730
we've seen the sellers we've seen the

981
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,290
buyers but we've got a little story here

982
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,079
because what we wanted to be we had the

983
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,490
malware sample right we started with

984
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,140
that and we'll build it up and we did

985
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,640
the honey pots and then the Menin mother

986
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,710
talk and we had a traffic but we wanted

987
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,569
to know from where linux news is

988
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:44,040
actually selling we wanted to find

989
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,500
exactly their web platform or anything

990
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,780
we're actually the linux most was making

991
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,510
profit from so while going through the

992
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,660
websites and gathering data i found a

993
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,310
website that sold well it wasn't a

994
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,930
website it was an email related to many

995
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,830
web sites

996
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,430
and it's old Instagram fake social media

997
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,080
fraud but it's old as well periscope

998
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,310
flipagram nqe

999
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,200
and those social networks they're really

1000
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,120
not known and all I showed you a website

1001
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,010
earlier they didn't sell periscope the

1002
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,320
programming QE I don't want to know

1003
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,670
about that social networks just quickly

1004
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,700
periscope its livestream you you

1005
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,110
livestream your life and people look at

1006
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,440
you

1007
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,040
if flipagram is just videos a little bit

1008
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
shorter than YouTube but a little bit

1009
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,630
longer than vines and Kiwi is a new

1010
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,770
social network where you can ask

1011
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,860
questions and do you have replies from

1012
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,260
people so here the girl asks if you had

1013
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,760
one last meal on earth before you died

1014
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,590
what would really be and then people

1015
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,810
would reply and starts conversation like

1016
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,030
that so yeah I found a seller that did

1017
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,530
that and Kiwi was probably the last

1018
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,300
known one and I went to see a TV and I

1019
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,160
was like well you know I think that

1020
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,660
could be it because he's selling exactly

1021
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,370
what we see in the traffic so maybe it

1022
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,980
could be Arabic masters right so we

1023
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,370
created a fake profile and we decided to

1024
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,200
just go like we went downstairs about

1025
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,330
like a brand new credit card and bought

1026
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,190
six thousand followers six thousand on

1027
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,260
my fake profile which isn't supposed to

1028
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,770
be a young photographer and they were

1029
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,030
provided to me I don't know if you see

1030
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,280
it like the first sort of up in between

1031
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,380
a weekend right I had my 6,000 followers

1032
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,990
but then the day afterwards I lost lots

1033
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,100
of them so I decided to right right

1034
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,200
right back to the master saying well you

1035
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,740
know I bought 6,000 followers and like I

1036
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,050
lost 500 when I wrote it I had lost 500

1037
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,120
but afterwards I lost more could you

1038
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,190
please provide them back to me and then

1039
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,600
I did that little story where I needed

1040
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,600
them for winter photography and he

1041
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,600
replied sure adding and then if you look

1042
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,030
back he gave me 8,000 followers which is

1043
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,770
great right I got really popular right

1044
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,050
there and it's it stayed like that for

1045
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,150
like few weeks so I was really popular

1046
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,220
it's really nice but then it dropped

1047
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,150
again for like a thousand follow 1,100

1048
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,120
followers so that's well the whole goal

1049
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,190
was to always ask more followers because

1050
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,750
our honeypots were still running so what

1051
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,700
we wanted is actually to see my profile

1052
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,870
go through the honeypot so we could

1053
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,300
confirm that it's him right so when I

1054
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,860
lost follower is like hey I lost more

1055
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,300
followers say can you push me up again

1056
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,660
and then he replied really badly written

1057
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,549
adding well followers are not forever

1058
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,940
but I'm adding them when you asked for

1059
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,210
and then he added me some that's I don't

1060
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,819
because the problem is that Quincy it

1061
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:26,670
does your your graphs for media

1062
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,220
statistics but after two weeks it became

1063
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,319
like you needed to pray so I had to stop

1064
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:36,900
following my matrix so and yeah so I

1065
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,420
lost more followers asked again and he's

1066
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,339
just stop replying to me so that's not

1067
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,660
true he's not providing them and

1068
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,270
whenever I asked but and today um

1069
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,299
honestly my fake profile has now a

1070
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,520
thousand followers so I lost most of

1071
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,440
them which makes me really sad but it's

1072
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,030
fine and you see how much like of a

1073
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,440
loser I am when you look at the people

1074
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,079
reacting to my pictures which are

1075
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,520
pictures I took right but the profile

1076
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,940
did go through our honey buds so well it

1077
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,650
goes it went through it looked at my

1078
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,089
profile and it's really not a known

1079
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,859
profile and I couldn't be in the metrics

1080
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,660
of you know trending profiles and

1081
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,030
usually Linux knows what it does is it

1082
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,819
visits profile before creating a like so

1083
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:19,650
we're fairly sure it's actually him and

1084
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,450
we're pretty proud just because we ran

1085
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,279
from my malware sample up to where it

1086
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:26,010
actually sells from its platform so yeah

1087
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,789
that was the little story here and the

1088
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:31,049
last feature large potential

1089
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:34,170
profitability well that's because we

1090
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,119
have like lots of data and we were

1091
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,460
thinking we know how much how many sorry

1092
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,740
follows a honeypot does you know how

1093
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,680
many follows a but does on average right

1094
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,240
not exactly but on average because we

1095
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,029
had many of them so what we did is we

1096
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:49,740
took the average of follows they each

1097
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,170
performed and we knew the prices and

1098
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,609
even though we we were fairly sure it

1099
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:55,890
was him the websites I talked about

1100
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,660
earlier we still wanted to take the

1101
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,700
average price just to in case it's not

1102
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,650
him right so the average price per

1103
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,720
10,000 follows an Instagram is 0.00

1104
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,119
$0.11 per follow so taking into account

1105
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,670
we know how many follows and but does

1106
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,059
and how much it costs we estimated it

1107
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:16,829
that Linux most potential revenue was

1108
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:19,260
about 13 bucks per month per baht which

1109
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,369
is a lot

1110
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:23,160
it is a lot just because we pay 10 bucks

1111
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,990
for our servers to run our honey pots

1112
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:25,430
rights

1113
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,600
we could still do our three dollars

1114
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,220
profit if you had like a religion

1115
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,950
abutment but you know it's probably not

1116
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,390
that we all know that because you saw

1117
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,550
that I had three followers giving to me

1118
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,400
so it's probably not a toll like they're

1119
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,890
not much and I monetizing all the photos

1120
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,840
that they're doing but it still shows

1121
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,590
you that even if because here's a graph

1122
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,110
that we did you don't see it we had at

1123
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,140
95% conferred a little intervention as a

1124
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,790
matter so um

1125
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,280
that shows you if the potential revenue

1126
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,840
per month according to the number of

1127
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,090
putts that the next most potentially

1128
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,550
owns so if it wants for example thirty

1129
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,400
thousand bucks then it would made about

1130
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,750
four hundred thousand dollars per month

1131
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,060
and that's a lot but let's say okay no

1132
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,190
he's actually monetizing half right cuz

1133
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,560
half he's giving it away to actually

1134
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,630
complaining about it then it means that

1135
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,010
it would still do two hundred thousand

1136
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,560
dollars and it's still a lot of money so

1137
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,590
the only like oh yeah and I had as well

1138
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,350
if we can trust because OVH was attacked

1139
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,120
and they said that they were attacked by

1140
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,950
one point five terabytes per second

1141
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,930
attack and they were targeted by more

1142
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,660
than 150 devices right this means that

1143
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,110
there's at least 150 150 thousand

1144
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,450
devices that do have telnet open and

1145
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,490
that are susceptible to Linux moose

1146
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,100
infection and our graph is quite quite

1147
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,360
it's not conservative but it's still

1148
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,120
only five thousand five fifty thousand

1149
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,250
thoughts right so if we work to go like

1150
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,870
up it would have been like insane

1151
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,130
amounts of money and we didn't want to

1152
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,260
do that but it still shows us that

1153
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,880
they're sort of sitting on a pot of gold

1154
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,920
it still shows us that because it's a

1155
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,330
lot of money you charge it to normal

1156
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:03,220
people hiding in plain sight okay sorry

1157
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,020
so let's do a recap here Linux Moos

1158
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,940
button it right it stands on the cover

1159
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,000
scheme where it's stealthy it has no x86

1160
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,800
variants and it runs on embedded system

1161
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,230
it's constantly adapting when we found

1162
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,950
it first at ISA they actually modified

1163
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,050
the button it quickly creates no direct

1164
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,270
victim no one's actually interested in

1165
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,910
to social media fraud it doesn't it's

1166
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,380
not like ransomware there's no people

1167
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,600
losing money the hides in plain sight

1168
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,820
sells to everyone through Google

1169
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,160
searches and it has a large potential

1170
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,900
profitability so what we believe is that

1171
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,610
then expose is actually just some sort

1172
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,200
of a perfect cybercrime

1173
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,900
just because it's sort of it runs on a

1174
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,640
button on infected devices that's the

1175
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,800
criminality here but it still sales

1176
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,010
around all it's still sort of within a

1177
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,869
scheme that's all peculiar and doesn't

1178
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:52,609
create victims and all that so and it's

1179
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,040
makes it's making a little money so

1180
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,510
that's yeah that's pretty cool we were

1181
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,099
like yeah we found some sort of the

1182
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:00,260
perfect cybercrime except that we had to

1183
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,500
go through all this to end up with that

1184
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,690
actual conclusion which we call the

1185
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,050
shallowness of humanity right and it's

1186
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,030
so perfect that sorry I don't know why

1187
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,800
it's doing that what it's so perfect

1188
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,440
that we couldn't raise any interest from

1189
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,300
line person or hosting providers so we

1190
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,119
went to conferences where it was police

1191
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:21,829
everything oh we've got a button okay

1192
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,570
it's like it infecting devices always

1193
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,119
their victims nope

1194
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,470
then they just didn't want to help us

1195
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,490
and then we wrote to a hosting provider

1196
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,859
hey which I take it down and you know

1197
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:32,660
with privacy that's normal it's fine but

1198
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,510
in the end it's we're sort of doing a

1199
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,220
cowl up right now saying well if you

1200
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,990
want some people stopped making money of

1201
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,390
a botnet well we're here and we can help

1202
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,569
you and we like to say that we lost

1203
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:48,020
faith in humanity until until we saw

1204
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,089
this which is a Boyar and it's called

1205
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:54,140
dogs with more money than you so it just

1206
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,010
gives you more faith right so thank you

1207
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,900
very much and just quickly we invite you

1208
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,460
to do more like mixed research if ever

1209
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,630
you want to do that because it's really

1210
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,849
nice you get the technical letí's around

1211
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,500
the button net but also the market and

1212
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,690
how it works and how it makes money so

1213
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,490
thank you very much and you've got the

1214
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,619
Linux most IOC's on github

1215
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:15,140
ESET and our research paper on goal

1216
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,240
security net slash blog thank you

1217
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:48,050
you got any questions so the the reason

1218
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,750
is the clean IP addresses is that if you

1219
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,400
infect on some routers you have IP

1220
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,350
addresses that are coming from DSL or

1221
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,720
cable which are really legitimate and so

1222
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,750
I think that if like Instagram saw a lot

1223
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,730
of requests coming from OVH or from

1224
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,020
hosting providers they will definitely

1225
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,570
flag them more likely as spam especially

1226
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,460
if there are several users behind the

1227
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,660
same IP address

1228
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,120
so really about leveraging what we call

1229
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,710
clean IP addresses in the in the paper

1230
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,260
it's a good question

1231
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:23,510
any other questions yep enjoy blackhat

1232
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,770
and see you guys around

1233
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:27,280
Cheers
