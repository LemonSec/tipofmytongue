1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
okay okay everyone yeah my name is

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,779
Alexei and today we are going to talk

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,059
about car networks is used and some

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,460
things in automotive and you know it's

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,380
already a hot topic and a lot of people

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,039
talking about it and can try to make

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,449
something interesting for you

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,330
unfortunately are not able to bring

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,210
hardway here let's reason for it because

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,539
it's heavy and it's actually located in

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,550
Russia and belongs to my friends not to

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,969
me but yeah so anyway I prepared few

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,160
demos and so I want to say that I have a

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,700
lot of slides and not enough time

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,040
because we're now is not enough for me

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,620
if I am going to skip you boring slide

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,360
like you know this Who am I and so on

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,620
you could see everything on the slides

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,629
that you don't need additional comments

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,180
probably and that's why I just you see

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,410
where I'm walking in what is my

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,719
background and I came from and a lot of

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,949
things so let's go to switch it's

24
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,750
another slide I want actually about this

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,610
one I want to spend to this few seconds

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,680
because we have a community in Russia

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,900
it's like a white-hot let's call the

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,780
tripod kakak hackers and they written in

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,270
automotive things and actually I need to

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,759
say thank you to this community because

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,170
everything I done they test it on new

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,939
hardware and I got a lot of feedbacks

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,729
from them a lot of information and it's

34
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,710
like we all work like a community here

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,020
it's why I put them in the slide and you

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,880
can see they have different interests

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,619
some of them reverse engineers someone

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,380
going to build their own stand for car

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,729
like capitals of wheels and so on and

40
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:45,049
thanks to those guys and let's go next

41
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,759
it's like going to be disclaimer because

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,500
all this automotive fixed all starts

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,240
with saying same things like Charlie

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,909
Miller philosophy that it's really like

45
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,549
this and this automotive industry has

46
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,770
some issues it's true but it's not so

47
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,659
bad as of people talking about like the

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,430
second security they don't know what

49
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,670
they're doing and actually not yes they

50
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,679
like everywhere else there are some

51
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,240
security issues automotive knowledge

52
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,090
exclusion here so but a lot of people I

53
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,069
know they work for the motive and

54
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,020
actually my company is also not security

55
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,120
company I'm not working and will provide

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,740
any security services I'm working in

57
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,560
company who like B's in automotive

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,170
development and a lot of guys who trying

59
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,790
to make things secure but there are some

60
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,250
reasons why it happens that or that this

61
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,650
so anyway just disclaimer that I'm not

62
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,290
going to sell anything no blame

63
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,770
automotive industry and this like going

64
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,550
to be like you know this into a lot of

65
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,970
attack vectors very big surface attack

66
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,950
surface and this is true but I think

67
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,870
most of you already know these things

68
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,970
and I don't want to spend again time and

69
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,700
yes you could probably attack GPS and

70
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,540
spoof GPS you could try to inject virus

71
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,790
friends into child pressure system

72
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,660
wherever yeah

73
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,810
it's a lot of different things and

74
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,400
because my tropical like testing pen

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,980
testing vehicle and this is not only

76
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,989
can't can is very small part of all

77
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,030
these and actually this last part and

78
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,190
you already have car compromised but how

79
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,170
you get into the car specially remove is

80
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,600
very weak and interesting question and I

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,670
believe a lot of new research will be

82
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,620
published soon by a lot of guys because

83
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,070
a lot of people really work in it and

84
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,110
probably connected cars also interesting

85
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,810
things because they're it's a

86
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,760
toxic-waste extended now this with all

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,019
these backends and internet things if

88
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,760
you compromise internet service for car

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,290
you probably could compromise the car

90
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,090
itself like you know the so application

91
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,340
unlock doors from the forum they have

92
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,959
synchronized from internet series and so

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,269
on and so it's once again attack

94
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,280
surfaces really beacon not concentrated

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
on downtown security but I'm here more

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
concentrated on local interfaces like

97
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,299
local interfaces which is like obd2 port

98
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,640
and so on but actually it's much more

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,340
more interfaces like local access points

100
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,880
from the car you use be port actually

101
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,880
some cards like Ethernet over USB so if

102
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,890
you connect simple Ethernet adapter or

103
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,870
USB or get access to other net network

104
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,539
of the kind a lot of things could be

105
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,290
done here but again we are concentrated

106
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,500
tolkien sedated on Khan and that's why

107
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,990
I'm going to talk more about cont here

108
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,780
and again and I need to mention the

109
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,120
research done by Greece and Charlie

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,810
three or four years ago about Kahn

111
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,550
networks different topologies and what

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,530
you can do is is you how you could

113
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,060
affect control work on the car and it

114
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,100
was a really good research here I just

115
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,930
want to mention that yes canvas is one

116
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,990
of the main but is not only one buses a

117
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,760
lot of buses in the car

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,530
it's like kilometres of different wires

119
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,600
inside the car but converse with

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,070
responsible for controls and

121
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,320
communication between different devices

122
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,510
like engine you know still powers to

123
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,690
your component and logs a lot of

124
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,440
different things and maybe main

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,750
defensive mechanism what automotive

126
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,840
vendors do it's a physical segmentation

127
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,550
of network because canvas is broadcast

128
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,870
let's hold broadcast because if you

129
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,840
before me was device and they can frame

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,090
signal or other devices on this can will

131
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,530
receive the signal and already this

132
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,410
device decide by itself is it it's

133
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,750
supposed to be action for for for me or

134
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,480
not and that's why automotive vendors

135
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,850
and they try to do some segmentation

136
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,520
like critical pathways are isolated from

137
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,270
like say over GD agnostic or head unit

138
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,820
entertainment buses and I just want to

139
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,520
mention it here and yes again can frame

140
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,030
is actually come boss it's very simple

141
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,730
technology very simple protocol like

142
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,880
physical layer and transport layer is

143
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,970
very simple and maybe I just want to

144
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,920
mention the most important like fields

145
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,350
and con frames arbitration field I call

146
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,000
it ID because actually it's also works

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
as identification like maybe source of

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,370
message but or destination but actually

149
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,590
there are no such terms of like source

150
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,030
address or destination dressed like an

151
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,800
IP it's only ID and already

152
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,690
different interpretation could be done

153
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,060
on different layers that arbitration

154
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,270
field here is not designed not for Iggy

155
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,990
but for I'm ticklish as a anti-collision

156
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,420
system because it's a differential pair

157
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,230
and dominant big here is 0 so if device

158
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,050
put 0 it's like signal in the bus and if

159
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,660
we don't want to have collisions how

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,760
it's done here so let's say we have two

161
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,230
devices at the same time the right

162
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,300
message they synchronized by clock so

163
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,980
they start writing at the same time and

164
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,560
the first filters you could see at

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,090
arbitration field so the both of them

166
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,940
write 0 on the paths and at the same

167
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,560
time we read in the message from the bus

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,260
and they see zero but let's say and then

169
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,620
an our next second device sent one to

170
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,510
the bus but first device and zero to the

171
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,400
bias what does it mean it's mean that

172
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,040
the second device who put one in the bus

173
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,020
has higher arbitration field voila

174
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,420
ideally value is higher but when it's

175
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,250
read from the bus it's C zero because

176
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,320
the first device with lower arbitration

177
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,570
field whether it send zero and its

178
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,760
dominant beam so it's zero so that's how

179
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,410
the second device understand that the

180
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,060
third and another device in the network

181
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,270
right now writing this with higher

182
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,980
priority because zero in the network and

183
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,590
stop sending signals is his time so

184
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,380
probably it's important because it's

185
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,870
from security point of view it's also

186
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,130
for Assigned of denial of service

187
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,870
situation we could send a lot of

188
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,650
messages with like arbitration field 0 1

189
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,300
or like very low value and it's mean

190
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,890
that our other devices couldn't

191
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,630
communicate anymore because they think

192
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,510
some more important things happened in

193
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,750
the bus and probably also try to miss

194
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,260
this light and very fast explanation but

195
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,690
actually it's what Charlie million peace

196
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,350
elastic did is lost their research I

197
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,080
wanted to show that con bus it's

198
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,300
probably it's like love tape of your

199
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,610
resource of your test it's not the first

200
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,870
because if we are talking about the

201
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,610
motor tack vectors and I already

202
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,990
mentioned before it's more important how

203
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,820
you get into the car and for example

204
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,250
here you could compromise that unit is

205
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,720
like million different ways like

206
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,220
stackoverflow in the browser

207
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,409
or use of too free in the browser and

208
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,240
they gave like Cuban eggs and on the

209
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,310
latest version of communiques has an ex

210
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,730
and XLR support so I mean there could be

211
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,260
done a lot of research in this area and

212
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,720
this is really interesting topic but

213
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,850
then they need as I mentioned before

214
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,190
head unit has no access to privileged

215
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,380
con like it's critical to access to

216
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,360
engine for example because in different

217
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,750
isolated con segments so they need

218
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,360
second exploit to have a local privilege

219
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,370
escalation attack and they need to

220
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,440
compromise another component of the car

221
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,590
like gateway su is the best option here

222
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,510
and if you compromise gateways you we

223
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,640
already have access to all buses that

224
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,560
connected to this issue and then you

225
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,390
could already sent message and try to

226
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,350
control the car yeah also I want to talk

227
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,290
about local vectors because cars very

228
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,370
interesting and think and actually on

229
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,560
this side I'm going to talk about like

230
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,050
you could put something inside your car

231
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,430
like you could remove the front panel

232
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,010
you can get access to current bus

233
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,530
critical converse connect a small device

234
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,390
that action ISM and min the video but

235
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,430
with Jason modem and then put this panel

236
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,320
back you will never find this device but

237
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,870
your car a back door it like physically

238
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,950
backdoor it and yeah that's like

239
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,220
possibilities what you could do and it's

240
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,180
mean yeah remote control but ok I'll

241
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,940
skip this so it's very simple ideas and

242
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,850
not related to really to what I want to

243
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,460
talk but this one probably focus more

244
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,120
it's also local vector but already it we

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,210
are talking about real crime but you

246
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,770
know this whole remote attack Dexter's

247
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,450
exported screw for resources but you

248
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,580
never thought about here attack like who

249
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,440
hath explored Sampson and did some

250
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,300
damage but I believe you heard about

251
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,730
tips that three guys who really

252
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,610
interesting into your car networks

253
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,380
unfortunately and they have a different

254
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,920
thing so they could do with your car for

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,589
example yeah you have immobilizer keys

256
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,690
and there's some cryptographic things

257
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,260
there and let's say T if he don't have

258
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,560
this device but he still able to

259
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,140
steal your car because of different

260
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,230
things one of these they use like

261
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,330
different devices that's called exploit

262
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,170
there's easier to have an analogy here

263
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,220
so they have different exports but

264
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,560
unfortunately fortunately they don't

265
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,839
export real box an issue they use like

266
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,589
common architecture design issues in car

267
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,470
networks it I never heard about like use

268
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,650
of to free an engine issue to bypass key

269
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,380
as a noun but who knows maybe in the

270
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,790
future anyway they really want to access

271
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,730
to canvas to bypasses immobilizer for

272
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,440
example checks and start the engine

273
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,710
result keys and when I talking about

274
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,900
unauthorized car Naxos it's not only

275
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,980
obd2 deeds they know where is your real

276
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,620
critical important compasses for example

277
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,540
the third picture they just make a small

278
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,810
hole in the door they found the bus

279
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,460
canvass connect to this the press the

280
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,350
button the send a signal unlock door

281
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,120
now those unlock the complete of the car

282
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,070
now they try to do something this engine

283
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,990
the same techniques I will show later

284
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,570
IGS about it and the second picture the

285
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,370
send a probe window goes into the car

286
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,320
remove lump of the top connect to the

287
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,730
campus because it's lab controlled

288
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,589
overcome but also this can't had access

289
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,260
to something more interested for the and

290
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,140
for for these teeth and yeah this real

291
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,440
case it is how they work and this is

292
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,030
black market like with exploits you

293
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,550
could find forum and they sell the

294
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,030
Chinese devices for some prize they have

295
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,490
this forum people who are charged if you

296
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,020
could trust people they have semi

297
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,480
gratings for criminals and the device

298
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,690
looks like on these pictures and yeah

299
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,320
this is how how it is and yeah I

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
mentioned here the protocol I saw 14 2 2

301
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,260
9 1 which is UDS and this is if you

302
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,030
remember I told you that canvas is just

303
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,810
8 bytes

304
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,430
data and at all but modern communication

305
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,260
is it's not enough advice to know how

306
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,910
thought what if you want to send 17

307
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,610
bytes so it's the next level like next

308
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,200
ocean model we will option you have

309
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,720
videos protocols it's already he could

310
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,980
send any lens message you like

311
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,420
and you GES based on this OTP protocol

312
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,670
it's diagnostic service protocol it's

313
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,130
like Albany but in UTS you could do

314
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,260
changes on the issue like you could

315
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,329
reset keys probably update firmware

316
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:21,290
change parameters of your issue and

317
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,850
that's why these devices could be used

318
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,399
for Dylan as well and okay so that is

319
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,399
good I mentioned a lot of bad things

320
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,769
that actually current research not about

321
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,079
dead things it's also good guys here

322
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,949
like security researches and the problem

323
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:44,699
here that can information about con

324
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,889
traffic and cars is not published on

325
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,480
publicly available so it's not

326
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,010
documented and researchers need to

327
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,060
understand everything by themselves

328
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,980
that's why we have a lot of different

329
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,860
countries right now open sourced and

330
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,940
also there are a lot of guys could learn

331
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,740
some development like fluid management

332
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,019
too small connected car devices you

333
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,610
could work and in Amazon you could buy

334
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,130
it and those guys also need to do some

335
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,360
research to understand how they could

336
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,070
control what information they could get

337
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,100
from the car and from the car network

338
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,630
and of course anti-cheat system they're

339
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,120
also based on common like custom

340
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,029
entities systems a lot of good guys

341
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,880
doing also research in this area

342
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,800
also there are ugly things I called it

343
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,300
ugly because it's not crime like

344
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,550
directly against someone but people want

345
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,769
to reset Milledge counter of the car to

346
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,649
sell it like as new and of example car

347
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,810
got into crash and I'll bet pirate they

348
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,610
want to change this Arabic since Elvis

349
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,130
car but then they need to reset V in

350
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,800
code of this are bad devices to put it

351
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360
in the gutter I mean a lot of things

352
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,220
happen here and guys who build in

353
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,190
automotive which is not me I'm security

354
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,310
guy from like other I came from

355
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,350
penetration tester for me it's also like

356
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,730
new I don't know what they know and

357
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,709
these guys they don't want to share

358
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,440
information it's a thing they keep

359
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,240
everything for themselves and yeah and I

360
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,370
came to the situation than a lot of con

361
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,339
tools in the market market on the open

362
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,990
source and actually in the market as

363
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,529
well and they cool they really good they

364
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:13,760
do

365
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,250
what they designed for but for me I

366
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,860
wanted something else because if I want

367
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,150
to do many the media what I would do

368
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,740
with this script so I need somehow to

369
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,080
automate the speeds to create a

370
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,060
man-in-the-middle another problem that

371
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,550
model guys not guys who making tools

372
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,530
they making them for special hardware

373
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,870
they do actually make a hardware they

374
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,020
want to sell it and they - and for me

375
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,880
it's also not convenient because I want

376
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,700
to work with all Hardware possible so

377
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,760
that will exist of them on the market so

378
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,130
I want to have Hardware independent

379
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,380
software I want to have RPI if I want to

380
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,550
do some unit tests X not all and

381
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,210
integrate my controls with some other

382
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,700
software which could be used from during

383
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,100
developing that back I want to do to

384
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,780
have validation test automatically so

385
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,880
something like that and I want to cover

386
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
all the different models that I could

387
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,660
connect together like I want for this

388
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,130
test for the another testament to

389
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,170
connect it like another way so it's like

390
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,210
if somebody is in the new radio

391
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,070
interface something like that so I have

392
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,360
different models they connected together

393
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,880
and have a solution for this situation

394
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,800
and in a pivot so firstly it happened in

395
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,870
February so it's pretty fresh and buggy

396
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:36,230
software but yeah and yeah that's what I

397
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,330
want to say it's engine support multiply

398
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,430
interfaces so you could do man in the

399
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,540
middle you could do whatever you want

400
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,460
you have a lot of ready to use models

401
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,280
like father's you just Connors black box

402
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,640
scanners statistic analysis features and

403
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,800
a lot of different things I have

404
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,330
supported right now just to hardware

405
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,130
just because I bought my money and at

406
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,230
support for this but it's very easy to

407
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,570
extend for any other code very hardware

408
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,150
it's also support can socket in case you

409
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,880
want to use it yeah I think a speech

410
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,359
this one because yeah you could have

411
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,520
gone over TCP so you if you want to have

412
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,890
a read distributed for some reason if

413
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,270
you want it I don't know in this

414
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,770
situation it could be useful but in my

415
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,560
case my friends in Moscow and I live in

416
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,390
Berlin I want to work with Scala oculus

417
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,420
and for me it's one of the solutions how

418
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,079
I can do this

419
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,270
but it could be done for any other

420
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,689
reasons

421
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,369
this is the design and architecture of

422
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:35,369
my device of my device my software like

423
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:39,029
it's unique unique flexible and you

424
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,869
could use it in different situations so

425
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,070
main idea here that I have a lot of

426
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,929
different models I connect it into pipe

427
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:48,119
and I have scenario which is described

428
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,460
in config file and have step 1 2 3 5 6

429
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,379
then loop again in 1 2 3 so it's like

430
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:55,080
infinitive loop and scenario repeat from

431
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,090
time to time again and again and half

432
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,249
infinitive numbers of pipes so I could

433
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:01,379
do it like in parallel so format at this

434
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,609
example of my name is the middle voice

435
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,769
firewall so then in this case count

436
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,529
tools action as firewall I connected

437
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,679
with two devices to one wire and captive

438
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll connect one and one device to

439
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,519
another went another device or all

440
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,590
traffic goes for consoles and I could

441
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,269
block any messages I wanted see what

442
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,320
happened and this is config for this

443
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,559
setup so I have two models for one

444
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,389
interface for another interface and have

445
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:29,609
one model for firewall to block and then

446
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,279
on one pipe I read from first interface

447
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,899
then I write the second interface of the

448
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,369
second pipe I read from second to

449
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:37,739
FaceTime mm face so and this is an

450
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:42,269
example of man in the middle and I wrote

451
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,190
and this is how we describe an actual

452
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,100
config file for controls it could be GUI

453
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,330
interface with this config but I

454
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,389
actually have no time to do this so it's

455
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:54,139
right now confer calmly in text mode I

456
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:57,359
think give give developer API else key

457
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,639
but is right about how I could create

458
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,739
your own models with on any business

459
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,749
logic you need and it's pretty simple

460
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:07,230
you could do this it just general cloth

461
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,840
and you override methods so that's all

462
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,570
and I want to say sorry about the

463
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,379
commutation

464
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:16,559
which yeah countdown almost the one and

465
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,109
main developer of this think and don't

466
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,169
have enough time to make a good

467
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,489
documentation that I had come have use

468
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,950
cases describe it how to use it and what

469
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,649
we can do with type of tests and so on

470
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:32,129
and for today's session because I

471
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,730
realize I don't have

472
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,980
hardware to show you something like how

473
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,200
a grill test to use cases that you could

474
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,830
use I have idea to create a virtual car

475
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,559
I was inspired by the guy called dn5

476
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,919
because he created jakka for himself we

477
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,490
do not see but he is not a good thing

478
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,120
for me I think it was he but the thing

479
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,299
here that I decided to get my own

480
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:02,289
emulator but based on cantos engine so

481
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,710
each issue is module 4 controls and each

482
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,610
pipe is in different conversation

483
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,190
emulated so physical is relation related

484
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,340
issue level emulation here and can get

485
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,200
ways also just the model for con tools

486
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,460
and all these monster act as one car

487
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,679
like a real car and it has UGS services

488
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,740
RPM engine and doors lights and so on

489
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,580
yep let's have look like so you could

490
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,590
run it you have some controls not few of

491
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,039
course it's just simple small and like

492
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,289
stand demo stand but it's enough to

493
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:45,190
understand like how cars works and let's

494
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,889
finally start to talk about actual test

495
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:49,480
and what you can do and why you need to

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,000
do actually here from this step I don't

497
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,350
want to concentrate more on the like

498
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,960
contours can do that or that it's it

499
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,669
will be not interesting to talk I want

500
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,340
to talk about like metal many different

501
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,590
methods you could do and can network and

502
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,159
different techniques tester or other guy

503
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,740
could and do on the car network example

504
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,299
here the simple to think you can do is

505
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,600
start of work with obd2 port because of

506
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,730
accessible you don't need to destroy

507
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,090
your car very easy and yeah by standard

508
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,600
pin 6 and 15 always responsible for the

509
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,480
agnostic comp bus but I want to say for

510
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,730
testers you could see here and I have a

511
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,600
lot of make model specific thing and

512
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,669
actually a lot of not a lot of some of

513
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,490
vendors they put other converters let's

514
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,019
say to be in 1 and 9 or 3 and 11 they

515
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,000
could be additional

516
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,650
that's like not by standard but enter

517
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,960
decide to use this pin for access to

518
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,730
additional composites and for a social

519
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,360
it's not a bad idea to change this model

520
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,100
specific pins to understand what

521
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,420
actually they're probably it could be

522
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,110
another can bus that first thing you

523
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,880
start and then if you finally already

524
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,770
have access and you could see some

525
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,610
traffic from the so BD and Keewatin side

526
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,690
probably not much because it's just

527
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,210
diagnostic you can't probably send like

528
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,800
signals to engine and so on but we

529
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,320
already talked about ug as before that's

530
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,220
used by attackers by tips and for do

531
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,480
some changes in views use to make your

532
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,760
engine start and this thing available

533
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,160
from obd it's important because new JS

534
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,380
it's like diagnostic service unified

535
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,960
diagnostic service and it's designed

536
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,460
that you for example came to service

537
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,320
centers they connect special vendor

538
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,980
approval

539
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,160
software do some Diagnostics you do some

540
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,340
changes on your issues like to make

541
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,650
mirrors softer and local like any other

542
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,330
any customizations at all could be done

543
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,220
on the on the sea level you can do only

544
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,290
from service center but they do it from

545
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,840
an uncommon cars click on modern cars

546
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,480
from UGS protocol which are each

547
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,110
available from OBD port and if you have

548
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,570
this software somehow download it and

549
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,370
you have friends in service center you

550
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,870
could just sniff traffic to understand

551
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,210
how it works to for example some

552
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,970
identification works and so on or you

553
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,990
actually could you just reverse

554
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,310
engineering of these tools and

555
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,370
understand more and more but one of the

556
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,520
examples it's not this button this

557
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,350
button it's you just come it's by

558
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,580
default that say i don't have these

559
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,070
tools i don't have this vendors tools

560
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,050
and but i want to find these UGS

561
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,820
services which i don't know

562
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,520
so it's the same analogy with port

563
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,980
scanning with tcp port scanning so here

564
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,550
we want to send can train to OBD port

565
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,340
with some ID with you just request and

566
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,130
see if response on this request came if

567
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,650
you saw them you DSL it exists on this

568
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,390
ID if not then

569
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,700
next ID and enumerate all IDs like

570
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,270
Corsica and it's pretty simple and

571
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,380
probably it's implemented in other tools

572
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,490
but I also did it here in controls it

573
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,850
works these two models come again pink

574
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,310
and mode start and I could actually show

575
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,030
you this some demo you'll be not so

576
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,620
boring so first of all has got my car

577
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,350
start second come close and I try to

578
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:39,640
find the mouse yeah so let's ship so

579
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,180
this is car a car me later has consoles

580
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,780
I started and I go to car interface and

581
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,970
it can be going little bit yeah this is

582
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,090
our car we could start engine it could

583
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:02,260
make her p.m. more here because unlock

584
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:08,800
lock tongue lights so on and we want to

585
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,650
find UDS services so we it's like karma

586
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,070
later such that the second controls like

587
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,920
different tool which is connected to OBD

588
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:26,100
port here Celia

589
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:42,210
yeah you can make it bigger yeah yeah

590
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,140
I'm very bad in HTML and CSS okay so you

591
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,410
know but I have a lot I have control

592
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,870
interface and it is just front-end have

593
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,880
web api so you could if you want you

594
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,590
could write any web interface you like

595
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,270
means and let's see what we have in obg

596
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:04,500
tool here so BG it's not start and we

597
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,920
could see as it's on obd2 so all this

598
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,960
you generate messages here and you could

599
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,090
see this and this gain pink we have

600
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,930
configured to make scan on this range of

601
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,390
ID's for services number 49 which is

602
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,980
authentication request so we check we

603
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,750
try to request identification then we

604
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,110
just press button start here wait and

605
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:37,800
scan will be finished and then if some

606
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,530
UTS response happened the mode start

607
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,920
should able to catch this as a UTS

608
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,230
session opened so as it should push here

609
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,330
now I've static for let's say you GS

610
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,930
and it's very small I try to make it

611
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:05,070
bigger it's not so easy without mouse

612
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,970
but ok it's here

613
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,130
service with number of 7:01 in hex

614
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,540
response on CID request with this data

615
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,550
which is probably seat for one

616
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,920
certification and that's how we found

617
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,200
the black box methods we found the

618
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,800
active available UTS service from obd2

619
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,210
port okay let's just an example how easy

620
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,680
it could be done and mcduck to probably

621
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,990
presentation no presentation

622
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:48,909
really okay let's go and this is example

623
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:51,159
from real car from the guys from Karpin

624
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,169
they just connected to dare try and do

625
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,809
scan for service number 10 which is

626
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,850
entered diagnostic session and a lot of

627
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,130
device replied here I just want to

628
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,520
mention that real life is always

629
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,590
different from what you have thought you

630
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,299
could do it from the books but car

631
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,179
hacking books because in this case huge

632
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:13,929
a subset is was different and how we

633
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,529
could understand that this is response

634
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,679
because you send let's say they sent

635
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,679
request with ID 1 and then we got

636
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,809
response with 89 so difference between

637
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:32,340
ID is 9 is 9 and it's by default like

638
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,659
described in u.s. protocol that each

639
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,450
response should be plus 8 by plus h-2

640
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,450
request because there are no again there

641
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,250
are no source of destination address

642
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,230
it's very difficult to understand who is

643
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,580
sender and who is receiver here that's

644
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,899
why in this protocol they have this

645
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,570
trick like a response should be plus 8

646
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,630
from response to the plus 8 from request

647
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,080
but in this car a response this offset

648
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,909
but different it's not standard and you

649
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,559
need actually also you could very easily

650
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,169
add instead from the traffic yeah but

651
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,880
yeah time is going and we need no

652
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,059
solution as examples another example we

653
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,130
have 2 diagnostic tools for this car we

654
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,570
also connected and could sniff and you

655
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,309
could see a lot of interesting data fact

656
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:17,500
which is use you have names for this

657
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,539
issue and controls could detect ASCII

658
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,610
symbols in this traffic so you could

659
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,690
understand what this issue is about but

660
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,820
more interesting is identification and

661
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,539
in this example hehehe and on my friend

662
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:36,399
he tried to run some change action so he

663
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,220
has issue like mirrors in he want to

664
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,929
disable this after clothes like a

665
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,210
mountain also it should be changed as

666
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,130
parameter an issue so here are the

667
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,080
diagnostic tools on this section and

668
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,490
sniff it with scan tools and this is

669
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,529
result of the sniffing and as you can

670
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,280
see the first part

671
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,790
is identification here so device

672
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,770
diagnostic tools send the request for

673
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,570
identification and they goat from the

674
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,470
car response and then they send second

675
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,550
request with another wall it's actually

676
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,590
key and feed so they sound did some

677
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,530
magic and get the identification key and

678
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,960
send it back to the device after that

679
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,140
they already could use another you get

680
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,910
comment code right by identifier and

681
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,720
they write some data to this parameter

682
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,870
so they have ID like cable IDs which by

683
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,330
parameter ID and voila so they have ID

684
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,950
which is probably five twenty or just 20

685
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,430
yeah 20 and the wall and then send it to

686
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,230
the device and the response work twenty

687
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,480
is written than the right something else

688
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,640
and then they confirmation they read the

689
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,770
same parameter to check if what they

690
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,160
read as I try to write is actually

691
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,620
written to the issue that's all fashion

692
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,230
sniffing in countries like you easily

693
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,970
could restore this session step by step

694
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,380
and if you ask about identification yes

695
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,720
it's in from issue and this is house

696
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,510
code from the tester device but then you

697
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,870
just after we're honest second at third

698
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,250
time you even don't need to do rather

699
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,070
than generic is very simple

700
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,080
unfortunately you can see the last part

701
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,280
of the fact that adjust a function of

702
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,010
addition so they have feed they have

703
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,350
been called they add pin code to seat

704
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,450
and this is actually our key so even not

705
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,970
exhort and if you know how to do

706
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,890
authentification if you want to create

707
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,560
some custom you J's to see totally

708
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,770
restore the whole logic from this but

709
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,490
because I mentioned that Khan is the UGS

710
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,920
is important for

711
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,890
thieves I want to show the DML I have

712
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:57,890
here so let's back to the car I'll stop

713
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,660
it and let's remove immobilizer keys

714
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,420
from this car okay I first need to

715
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,390
remove keys and here you not see how we

716
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,640
do this because I actually follows calls

717
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,390
wait a second I need to open I don't see

718
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:27,820
back here ah let's not be

719
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:44,710
examples lose faster on everything so

720
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,610
have controller here for engine and have

721
00:32:49,610 --> 00:33:00,380
key let's remove the mood and save and

722
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,960
start crying Snoopy here because two

723
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:15,790
screens and then go to the car

724
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,440
and if we press start mashing happens

725
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,390
without without key they are not

726
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:42,600
authorized to do it probably hip ii yeah

727
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,370
but we could do other things but we can

728
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,160
start engine everything right and then i

729
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,260
go to the demo think here and let's say

730
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,100
we drill withdraw and do a hole in the

731
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,190
door yeah

732
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,590
connect to the bars and we want to send

733
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:12,889
a signal like unlock door to be more

734
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:22,219
so I know the comment how to do this

735
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:31,469
and if I send it nothing happen probably

736
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:41,219
I think you can check your probabilities

737
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,739
in wrong yeah it should be here sorry I

738
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,489
send it to obd2 and because obd2 is not

739
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,409
allowed to have access to cabinets

740
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,120
nothing happens I sent it from yeah so

741
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,800
now we inside the car

742
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,720
now we could connect to obd for example

743
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,950
and this is a think UDS key for access

744
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,620
to the device is Charlotte I mean if you

745
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,510
know it's for one car you note for all

746
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,880
cars keys for immobilizer it's unique

747
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,750
for each person that's one of the things

748
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,820
that could be hidden so a tackle if you

749
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,260
don't know you're in a blazer key but

750
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,510
you know the eds key so what you could

751
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:26,190
try to do and this example he use this

752
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,100
key here let me just copy it because I

753
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:38,970
don't remember engine right sign it to

754
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,799
copy you geez come on

755
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:59,190
home button okay here seeker

756
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,710
and then we try to out not here here

757
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,400
she's not here I can see from this yeah

758
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,020
exam right and we do identification and

759
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,260
now we could write a parameter if we

760
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,210
because we already certificated in UJS

761
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,020
and identification will be 50 50 50 5 5

762
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,099
5 5 5 5 and we said in Yuki which is 17

763
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:38,400
X 0 let's make a 0 1

764
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,530
so probably now we reset keys from su

765
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,480
engine and now because we know this key

766
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,140
we could try to start this engine and

767
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,730
first we need to get the VIN number as

768
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:04,430
well because yeah from here I don't see

769
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:12,440
really I think I copy everything so we

770
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,180
set up a wing code here and our new key

771
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:29,390
which is 17 years and now we could try

772
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,348
to start a car

773
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:49,530
this that and yeah and now we have RPM

774
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,840
and everything so this is like example

775
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,430
in this simulator how it could be in

776
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,010
real life I can say this is example one

777
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,370
to one because it I'm not the thief but

778
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,070
that's how it's supposed to be and but

779
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,810
actually a lot of different situation

780
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,300
sometimes these can came this their own

781
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,340
is you to start engine they connected to

782
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,370
your car and use this issue to control

783
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,990
engine not the original one so there a

784
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,400
lot of different tricks and techniques

785
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,290
that these are using okay 15 minutes you

786
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,200
need to read up yeah but first need to

787
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,430
switch the presentation yeah this

788
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:32,340
scenario was shown and let's go to the

789
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,880
next thing actually is not a commercial

790
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,650
but it's very popular book that's what I

791
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,920
said I could put so I hear a everybody

792
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,800
heard about it and I also bought it and

793
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,320
read it and it's good book and do you

794
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,940
remember the beginning I sent the common

795
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,340
how to unlock the door like I put some

796
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,230
something so this the think actually

797
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,450
originally I didn't know how I don't I

798
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,910
didn't know this comment I need to do

799
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,830
some research to understand which

800
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,390
comment it should be and for example in

801
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,280
this book I really like a good example

802
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,050
you could dump a traffic is when you

803
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,360
need an action where this unlock comment

804
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,160
happened then you replace half of this

805
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,930
traffic and see door unlocked or not if

806
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,300
not then replay another house and pusher

807
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,950
to be unlocked then you take this house

808
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,470
and again it's like binary search it's

809
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,390
cool technique and it works and in this

810
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,680
book you could see like how you could do

811
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,140
this from scripts like replay I give

812
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,960
from the disease and as a quiet so

813
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,090
boring I mean it's car network is really

814
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,130
you could do a lot of automation in this

815
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,840
and unfortunately I found no tools that

816
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,210
could do this so that's why one of the

817
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,220
reason why I have started doing controls

818
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,070
but first I need to find the right

819
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,400
canvas it's another task for the tester

820
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,800
because like for black box a lot of

821
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,310
wires like a lot of wires really it's

822
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,650
kilometers of wires and you need to find

823
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,150
converses and what our car continues and

824
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,099
in Russia for their car they use simple

825
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,230
multimeter and they check the resistance

826
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,089
because if a car network is terminated

827
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:08,970
from both sides resistance should be 60

828
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,589
or if it's disconnected 120 so you could

829
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:15,180
find the time bus based on these simple

830
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,210
things of course if you have more

831
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,990
advanced devices for know how to English

832
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,900
in Russian called of slow growth but

833
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,569
yeah you could do it actually this

834
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,249
multimeter is very simple and what they

835
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:32,160
how they did it and this is last

836
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,499
pictures how they inject into the canvas

837
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,619
because I really don't recommend to do

838
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,799
any cut in the car it's not good idea so

839
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:44,190
we just took simple needles and connect

840
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,400
it clearly connects and first method I

841
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,710
want to present here which is very

842
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,369
simple it just different difference like

843
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,859
difference of two sets it's much faster

844
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,720
and simpler than replaying half by half

845
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,809
so we have first traffic dump which we

846
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:04,140
call it set one with noise we collected

847
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,180
traffic for example for two minutes and

848
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,549
did nothing for the castle just normal

849
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,319
traffic if nothing happened on the car

850
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,630
then we collect the second jump of the

851
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,529
traffic which is where is even happened

852
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:19,109
action like unlock door and it's a small

853
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,819
amount of traffic but actually for few

854
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,589
seconds it could be like 1000 different

855
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,989
countries because it's a traffic lot of

856
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,999
traffic in the bus and then you do a

857
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,890
simple deep and find the difference

858
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,420
between these two traffic's and probably

859
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,069
the difference will be what you are

860
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:34,440
looking for it's an example again from

861
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,819
real car well from the same my friends

862
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,059
from Moscow from me hi you and you see

863
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:47,430
and the first on the first picture it's

864
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,019
like thief how it looks like it's not

865
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,869
thousand pockets it's already just 20

866
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:54,239
different frames and it's much easier to

867
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:56,069
find the frame you're looking for in

868
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:58,769
this set then in $1,000 place but even

869
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,259
more it's too much for me I decide and I

870
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:03,299
add the additional filter like how many

871
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:05,460
different changes happened because let's

872
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,400
say in this frame it could be

873
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,750
I am as well because every p.m. changes

874
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,329
all the time and the bus is a lot of

875
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,279
different colors but it's a lot of

876
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,569
different we don't look it because

877
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:17,599
lock/unlock is with primary structure so

878
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,430
it's one rather and another so we could

879
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,500
set in for example in control filter on

880
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,869
only two different colors and see

881
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,849
already only four different messages

882
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:28,279
already here by statistic you could see

883
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,529
this is five five five and one so this

884
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:32,240
is one probably what we looking for this

885
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,970
is five it startles us matches messages

886
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,270
before it was 80 for example and now it

887
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,400
became zero it's because before it

888
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,460
statuses it's always sent door closed

889
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,039
closed front door closed left door

890
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:48,109
closed and then we did this action and

891
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:49,400
they changed of course they changed back

892
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,230
now it's opened that's why it's also in

893
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,589
the deef but if you put filter visually

894
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:57,619
one you find exactly this responsible

895
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,960
like main even we are looking for needs

896
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,279
much faster than doing replacement yeah

897
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:05,779
I think I do not show I mean it's very

898
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:07,309
simple I don't want to show this on

899
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:10,299
emulator just because of time but yeah

900
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:14,270
yeah and then they took another car and

901
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,359
it's more interesting case and the

902
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,599
default ready really big and if you set

903
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,329
filter onto on the to Wallace you can

904
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:25,700
changes from one color to another it's

905
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,329
also a few and there are no unique like

906
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:31,279
by count you can say what what about

907
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:34,339
exactly what exact message here and if

908
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:36,260
you put of course one there are no

909
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,809
unique messages so the answer is

910
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,640
somewhere here and it's not difficult to

911
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,400
find it by here playing one by one but

912
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,970
skew and it's not as clear as in

913
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,160
previous example I just want to show the

914
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,789
different classes different logic and

915
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:55,579
that's how I came into second method

916
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:58,220
I just specially created for black hat

917
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,819
just finished yesterday and it's based

918
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:03,829
on abnormalities so we're looking for

919
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:06,230
abnormalities in the traffic just iPhone

920
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,039
all machine learning cuckoo but no

921
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,270
machine learning to not good thing

922
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,670
everywhere here you could do machine

923
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,050
learning but education period will be

924
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,630
super-long van shape even simple replay

925
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,790
will be faster so I try to use another

926
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,710
method like these simple statistical

927
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,680
analysis and abnormalities detection so

928
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,530
I check for two things first beat that

929
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,130
has been changed is diff diff method

930
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,960
change waters like different levels for

931
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,990
example want to agree it's all three

932
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,130
different values but if you choose this

933
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,140
method it's same beat changes all the

934
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,880
time so for us it's not interesting

935
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,070
we're not interesting to make difference

936
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,320
between 1 2 3 because if same beats

937
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,380
changes all the time probably it's noise

938
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,260
so I have a history of all changes and

939
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,230
which beats has been changed and I

940
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,250
remember this bits for each ID and also

941
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,980
I remember the time between same frames

942
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,350
so it's 10 each second okay I remember

943
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,440
this minimum time and on-stage seconds

944
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,940
when I had a second set of traffic

945
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,810
action even happened I do the same I

946
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,370
understand the minimum time and for each

947
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,260
IV and beat this have been changes and

948
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,500
compare if new beats found its

949
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,870
abnormality funny that's how for example

950
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,480
rpm excluded by default because it's

951
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,180
almost same not always but always same

952
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,420
bit changes all the time and a lot of

953
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,210
noise to remove it very fast and next

954
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,800
stage free I do correlation between

955
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,260
different events so if this change it

956
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,090
felt and then after this another ID

957
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,820
change probably these two events are one

958
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,520
big event so I collect all these things

959
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,220
and output for same traffic from

960
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,280
previous example I got session

961
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,130
extraction it's like if you do door

962
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:02,670
unlock it's only these frames let's say

963
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,800
interesting for you and they sorted by

964
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,400
time here and biologic like let's first

965
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,950
change happen with the traffic then

966
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,360
there's a second change headed for

967
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,640
another it probably it's correlated

968
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,410
because this happened just after this

969
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,600
then other change in habit then

970
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,880
infiltrate the message start sending

971
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,640
more of them and so on and it's lucu

972
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,950
because by logic of course unlock

973
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,010
comments somewhere

974
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,710
the top and statuses on the bottom is

975
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,730
just biologic but it's still not all

976
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,070
what we can do and next step will be

977
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,100
automatic detection even this out like

978
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,510
human participating so what we could do

979
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,760
now when we have the session extracted

980
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,070
by abnormal us busy statistical method

981
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,680
we could replace met each one by one

982
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,870
from this session and then check if

983
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,750
these changes happened so if you replace

984
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,790
this message and this change is not

985
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,000
happened then this message did not cause

986
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,200
this changes so it's not what we're

987
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:03,620
looking for

988
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,550
then we'll replace second frame from

989
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,500
this list and we see the air that's now

990
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,360
changes this value changing from this to

991
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,490
this this to this and all this happened

992
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,110
so it's mean this is what we're looking

993
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,630
for and actually even it by follows you

994
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,210
could easily see that it was changed so

995
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,380
this is what what eight eight eight

996
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,330
eight became two two two two and just up

997
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:32,060
to this all this CEC like EE CEA a to EE

998
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,720
and also it's important because same

999
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,490
mechanism has closed I dissolve it's

1000
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,440
like door one door to door three to four

1001
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,210
and they have eyes they have the closed

1002
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,490
eye Dean Wallace let's change it while a

1003
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:48,950
second from fifth to eight bits they

1004
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,980
change it from one to two such acts

1005
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,840
loops like this is statuses of the doors

1006
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,440
and this is common and then it's back so

1007
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,820
looks like it's like button it was

1008
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,920
pressed during this time and it's

1009
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,670
released and it could be done totally

1010
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,650
automatic and probably as if I want to

1011
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:15,040
show on the stand the emulator I mean

1012
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,180
it's me

1013
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:30,680
I start different example

1014
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,140
so what you have in the car let me share

1015
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,610
this car status

1016
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:37,760
let's close doors okay let it be

1017
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,450
unlocked whatever it doesn't matter

1018
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:47,240
hmm start it so in what start let's

1019
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,880
check we see here we see some traffic

1020
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,790
here nothing just make a minyan and now

1021
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,840
we can go and

1022
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,010
and make a trade session on the butter

1023
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,840
set zero so Jian controls

1024
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,940
it's a lot of different butters you

1025
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,830
could operate with so by default it

1026
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,410
starts if you put current status that

1027
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:23,900
all actions and buffer default buffer

1028
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,580
with index zero and it's how many

1029
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,619
friends here think it's all because

1030
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,300
nothing happened with the car its noise

1031
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,119
it's what we could use for low on for

1032
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:35,750
training so we do here training press it

1033
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,190
then we could see here yes we found how

1034
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,430
many think unique ID and we down

1035
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,690
training so now we could switch to

1036
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,550
another book here here and then we could

1037
00:49:49,550 --> 00:50:00,890
do an action on the car say lock and go

1038
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,570
back so you don't need this before

1039
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,720
anymore so let's see so in buffer zero

1040
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,060
we have already some traffic and we

1041
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,760
already made the Train and before one we

1042
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,380
have 200 something I don't see from here

1043
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,750
frames and we could try to extract a

1044
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,210
session so it's an index one

1045
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:33,230
and it's result what we good here it's

1046
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,150
this example very simple I mean you

1047
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,040
don't even to replace yeah its first

1048
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,410
message then just change it happened and

1049
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,170
this is another correlation information

1050
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,020
so probably you say this comment is lock

1051
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,210
and this is door status one go into the

1052
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,080
head two doors its portico but I also

1053
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,020
want to show back to the ground make it

1054
00:50:54,020 --> 00:51:02,500
unlock again and egg to this one and

1055
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,560
let's try to have to run after the text

1056
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,200
feature hope it works with button yeah

1057
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,340
you see door closed

1058
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:20,660
and as a result here let me share them

1059
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,290
see from here yeah this is all right so

1060
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,450
we have the opposite so you really don't

1061
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,340
need to think too much I mean some

1062
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,720
things could be really automated in

1063
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,360
canvas and that's what I try to do yeah

1064
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,840
I see I have only 5 minutes and a lot of

1065
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,930
things to talk about

1066
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:47,240
it's ok and I want to say have a lot of

1067
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,620
features and development for example

1068
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,250
automatic field extraction because it's

1069
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,700
also interesting tasks because you see

1070
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,830
yes it looks like one message but there

1071
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,090
are could be different fields in one

1072
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,120
message and we could for example this

1073
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,580
feature done by my friend Sergei he

1074
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,340
doing solve one by one each for all

1075
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,010
sequence to see which beat changes more

1076
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,720
often than other for example if to beat

1077
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,120
changes in two different ages of field

1078
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,520
probably two different fields that's how

1079
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,600
this is again from real traffic it could

1080
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,210
apply this mechanism is this idea to

1081
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,720
select probably this's rpm and this is

1082
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,590
peak because covers and in statical

1083
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,790
position of move it during research and

1084
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,890
we could separate speed from rpm from

1085
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,840
one message and

1086
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:44,240
actually yeah and also I have a metadata

1087
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,610
support and controls so if you think you

1088
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,320
know what you have found you could

1089
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,840
create metadata config file for your

1090
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,520
project and then you could document and

1091
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,140
then data extraction will be already

1092
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,320
automated from these messages you could

1093
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,620
detect rpm value and it's probably speed

1094
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,480
and what comment which this ID is

1095
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,830
responsible for this then if you give

1096
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,270
this information to another researcher

1097
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,890
for him it will be easier to understand

1098
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,640
what you have done

1099
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,520
and so on okay faster that already

1100
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,640
showed you at how let's also customize

1101
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,040
algorithm to detect loops because very

1102
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,200
often we encode send for example in

1103
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,910
loops like repeatable encode this means

1104
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,460
never change and they don't use the so

1105
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:31,160
TP for this type of the information they

1106
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,530
use custom like counters you could see

1107
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,470
it's like 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 then they

1108
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,890
repeated again and again so I haven't

1109
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,770
lamented something like we could we

1110
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,260
assemble this chain and get the ASCII

1111
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,190
string so it's also could be useful and

1112
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:53,300
a lot of other things not only research

1113
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,520
I want to talk about validation tests

1114
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,660
and how you could do it this controls

1115
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,390
example it's very not that idea to

1116
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,960
validate and with it this is con gateway

1117
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,540
and of course you have example one bus

1118
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,880
and another bus and you want to be sure

1119
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,630
that the configuration of this device is

1120
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,180
meet your requirements and the problem

1121
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,030
and automotive that requirements done by

1122
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,910
the tape automaker but this device done

1123
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,850
by some company not by so it different

1124
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:29,750
company who did this device yes for yes

1125
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,340
by request offender it's like a

1126
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,170
relationship between them but

1127
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,910
technically different team different

1128
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,820
person and of course like vendors they

1129
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,950
need somehow to validate what they

1130
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,440
bought so probably it's one of the way

1131
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,930
how they could do this and I try to

1132
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,480
implement it some controls for example I

1133
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,050
sent

1134
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,200
oh oh tests like unit tests from one

1135
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,980
interface

1136
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,750
and another interface of contacts I

1137
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,339
connect to another part of the device

1138
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:57,710
and check which message passed which

1139
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,660
knot and it could be done like automatic

1140
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,800
that okay time is time and I want to say

1141
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,070
also about five ink actually there are

1142
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,650
you could do five ink and a simple thing

1143
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,300
I mean you understand for the southern

1144
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,730
cards but problem in car networks and

1145
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,770
it's very difficult to understand if

1146
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,170
this frame you did for like four

1147
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,079
thousand cows some wishes because you

1148
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,940
don't have debugger attach it to issue

1149
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,300
device you probably could do this it's

1150
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,920
okay it's one of the solutions but in

1151
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,119
general if you send a message to the can

1152
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:34,339
box you don't know what happened all if

1153
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:36,680
something set it or not and you don't

1154
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,690
know if you've hasn't found something

1155
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:41,630
and that's why you could do a little

1156
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,060
different things and I think here link

1157
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,869
to some paper of some academic guys who

1158
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:51,079
work in on this area but I also found

1159
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:52,820
that the same algorithm I implemented

1160
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,609
for automatic door unlock detection you

1161
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:57,440
could use four thousand because I have

1162
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,790
no time I can show it right now

1163
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,069
simulator that idea is the same you doof

1164
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,530
I think you learn your algorithms and

1165
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,130
you do father

1166
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,720
and then you see correlations happen

1167
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,420
between messages in fasting and other

1168
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,630
messages of the company for example you

1169
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,839
have like my device send message h ii

1170
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,599
you did fasten and it stopped sending

1171
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,550
message and you could definitely say

1172
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,010
after which message it happened so here

1173
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,980
it's me you could do this man and it's a

1174
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:34,790
lot of fun ok next thing is outer gate

1175
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:37,520
systems and fortunately I have no time

1176
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,160
that you think here that you could use

1177
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,380
controls for prototyping because yes

1178
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,300
it's very difficult to create a device

1179
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,280
and connect to car check something then

1180
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,960
you need to black device to the reflash

1181
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,849
you could create a prototype and

1182
00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:51,530
countries on Python like this all

1183
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,420
business logic very simply connected to

1184
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,230
real car

1185
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,480
check your logic on the flight to change

1186
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,010
the code and change it from the real

1187
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,340
boards

1188
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,590
stance or real car so it could be

1189
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,660
helpful for developer and here I have

1190
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,900
example of an intuitive system so first

1191
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,750
idea because I had no time I can show

1192
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,000
that now but I could at least say a few

1193
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,770
words first we could connect our device

1194
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,690
before like we could cut the engine a

1195
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:23,280
card can before the engine issue and put

1196
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,110
our device and the device do additional

1197
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,550
iterations of example it could be

1198
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:31,500
anything in my setup and actually I to

1199
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,660
this idea from real customer data system

1200
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,300
in Russia you might need to put a secret

1201
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,480
sequence actions inside collective like

1202
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,000
you know like fatality Mortal Kombat

1203
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,880
like up up down up up down and then you

1204
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,470
could start your car without detection

1205
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:49,020
you can do this so I did the prototype

1206
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,520
of this for one animal later and it

1207
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,590
works but this is that idea because if

1208
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,930
you make a mistake here you lost control

1209
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,230
of your h2 engine so another idea

1210
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,480
collect connected in concert in parallel

1211
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,670
then if your device press nothing

1212
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,770
happened but this is the same idea it's

1213
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,750
checked for left right left right secret

1214
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,330
sequence but if we detect the engine

1215
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,030
started its immediate the same common

1216
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,120
stop so you could it's like for for for

1217
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,670
intruder it looks like he could start

1218
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,760
and then second it stopped so he its I

1219
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,100
also took this idea from leo prototypes

1220
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,900
for the zone in Russia and Italy it's

1221
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,110
custom and it acceptance ideas it's a

1222
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,480
very popular idea and how can do both

1223
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,150
the receiver and some pork and the guy

1224
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,950
promised to put it on open source he

1225
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,740
didn't gives I can say anything but she

1226
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,740
tried to make a machine learning system

1227
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,040
and here for his own machine he made an

1228
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,400
education process for first step and

1229
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,040
then he checked that RPM speed should be

1230
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,690
also correlate and if it's not correlate

1231
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,830
and probably some attack happened ok and

1232
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,570
yeah this is contributors who helped me

1233
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,020
a lot and example my wife did all this

1234
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,390
graphical design he think Kakao is

1235
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:08,760
some algorithm for bits or detection

1236
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,010
tube detection algorithms and so on and

1237
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,620
so I think I have time for question at

1238
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,030
least maybe one two questions so oh

1239
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,650
sorry I have a lot of information not

1240
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,930
enough time yeah my fault but if you

1241
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:35,580
have questions please welcome David

1242
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,780
suggestion of where you could get like a

1243
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,970
car park form to actually test you go to

1244
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,680
John Kerry actually buy a used car or

1245
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,420
can you find integral individual pieces

1246
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,750
on eBay or something for example yeah mm

1247
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:52,770
probably if you remember the second

1248
00:59:52,770 --> 01:00:01,920
slide there was a picture of this so you

1249
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,650
could buy pieces on eBay but do you have

1250
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,570
problem because there are no information

1251
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,340
on how you could connect those devices

1252
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:12,390
together how to made a power supply and

1253
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,060
for example some issue devices they

1254
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,950
before they start looking for other

1255
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,750
issue devices and you couldn't start so

1256
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,840
you need to chose to do small research

1257
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,820
and then you could so then you could

1258
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,980
connect it and actually a friend of mine

1259
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,020
sir Gary he worked on this or he bought

1260
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,330
all these details as separate details

1261
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,430
and he starts connected and keep has

1262
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,040
kilometers of wires in his laboratory

1263
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,920
and yeah it's possible and it's much

1264
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,170
more safer for you to I'm going to do

1265
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,730
research because it's really not the

1266
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,730
best idea to do research in your own car

1267
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,950
yeah but eBay is one of the sources and

1268
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,600
also in Russia for example we have a lot

1269
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,640
of crashed cars and you could detail

1270
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,310
some distressed car somewhere also so

1271
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:56,610
it's not a big problem big biggest

1272
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,170
problem you don't know how to connect it

1273
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:01,230
this the biggest problem

1274
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,760
and gentlemen we're all the time if we

1275
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:09,290
give a hammer for thank you
