1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
morning everyone this I'm Pierce

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,020
O'Hanlon this is a Ravi Shankar Borgan

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,219
ah and we've been working on something

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,740
we've dubbed the the Wi-Fi based empty

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,850
catcher and so we're going to take you

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,699
through just a quick overview of what

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,160
we're going to cover in the presentation

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,230
so firstly just for those of you who

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,340
aren't aware like what is an MC and then

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,149
we're going to talk about conventional

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,739
MC captures MC is basically just the

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,870
identifier that's inside that identifies

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,610
a subscriber the international mobile

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,610
subscriber identifier and there are

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,110
conventional devices have been around

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,510
for a while one sort of trade names like

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,500
stingray that sort of work in the mobile

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,640
spectrum but our approach operates in

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,070
Wi-Fi and it basically exploits some two

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,400
issues to solve functionalities within

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,530
[Music]

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,100
the wave mobiles basically smart firms

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,979
but can the other devices connect to

24
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,540
automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,680
based on their I'm MC and also another

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,549
technique that's based around when

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,090
devices connect to the sort of operator

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,540
services for Wi-Fi calling so then we're

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,880
going to talk about mitigations for the

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,659
operator vendor OS and user mitigations

31
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,540
and then a demo so what is an MC is

32
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,820
basically as I said international mobile

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,369
subscriber identity

34
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,520
typically a 15 digit number the first

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
couple of digits indicate the the

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,329
country code and then the next couple

37
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,820
will the first three actually country

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,950
code next two or three sometimes

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,780
depending where you are indicate the

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,020
mobile network provider in which this

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,420
one's just to kind of made up one two

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,969
three four is actually the the UK code

43
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,459
and twelve is some kind of rail track

44
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,710
one but it just happened to be

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,990
two three four so I just don't put it in

46
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,460
there because what I've done in the demo

47
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,950
I've I've used that same MC is the kind

48
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,290
of demo in seekers I don't want to be

49
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,490
splashing wheel ones around then it

50
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,590
basically allows for the authentication

51
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,630
of a device to the network it's the

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,480
identifier so you username in a way and

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,790
then that keys that then allows the the

54
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,420
phone and the operators databases to

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,870
then index your secret key which is

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,380
which they both have a copy of and then

57
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,590
do this network authentication procedure

58
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,120
and it's typically installed within in

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,610
two places basically inside the SIM card

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,420
in the phone and the MC can actually be

61
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,630
read off of the off of the actual SIM

62
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,120
card using like a SIM reader one of

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,610
these little cheap those are things or

64
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,170
you can spend a lot of money but

65
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,330
basically it's pretty straightforward to

66
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,480
read an MC off of assume if you actually

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,210
got it in your hands but it's generally

68
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,520
another story if se San a device and you

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,170
want to try and find out what's the MC

70
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,780
of like that sort of this mobile phone

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,410
here like sitting on the desk that this

72
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,270
is what we've them the technique we

73
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,540
developed to do that they're also inside

74
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,660
the the SIM card Azzam the secret key

75
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,790
which is kept secret you can't access

76
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,400
that you can't just source a and plug it

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
into that reader and say give me like

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,080
secret key it it doesn't happen it's

79
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,700
kind of protected you can basically just

80
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,860
provide you can send it a random number

81
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,070
and it'll then carry out some algorithms

82
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,870
to do the authentication challenge then

83
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,450
it's also sword in the operator so they

84
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,620
clearly need to have it to the verify

85
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,230
that it's but it's a legit and

86
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,470
subscriber so it's also an identifier

87
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,029
that some can be used to tracking so

88
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,820
it's a fairly unique identifier that

89
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,560
basically is tied to the subscriber type

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
to the sim and typically people don't

91
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,350
change the sim Ralph and so

92
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,030
it gives you a good idea of them who it

93
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,670
is but there are also a bunch of other

94
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,890
identifies associated most smartphones

95
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,740
these days like Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC

96
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,620
addresses like the MAC address all those

97
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,390
you maybe where they have been moved to

98
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,190
make the Wi-Fi MAC address a bit more

99
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,400
elusive iOS introduced a Mac

100
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,000
randomisation on Wi-Fi probing I think

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,510
in iOS 8 and then they've taken it

102
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,670
slightly further forward Windows Mobile

103
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,420
introduced it and Android is is bringing

104
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,770
it in as well and then this other device

105
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,780
identifies them more associated just

106
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,970
purely with the mobile phone the IMEI

107
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,950
the international mobile equipment

108
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,920
identifier which is actually just tied

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,690
to the actual hardware of the device it

110
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,370
never changes in fact it's kind of

111
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,570
illegal to go changing as that that that

112
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,300
identifier but that can also be tracked

113
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,620
with some of the sort of conventional NC

114
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,750
caches do a downgrade attack and then

115
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,300
you go into a 2g attack and then you can

116
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,350
extract the the IMEI and then there's

117
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,560
what sort of technically known as the

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,940
MSISDN which is actually just like a

119
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,010
phone number

120
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,390
thanks potentially it can also be used

121
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,610
for tracking but that's typically not

122
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,580
that easy to get hold off

123
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,220
although the wrong sort of subscription

124
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,100
services out there that allow you to

125
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,340
look up in MC and then find out what

126
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,140
they potentially find out what the

127
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,880
corresponding numbers are some of these

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,440
are probably in a bit of a grey gray

129
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
area so now going to hand over to a

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
Revie who's been working in the

131
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
conventional empty CAPTCHA world for a

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,650
little while he's going to give you a

133
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,430
overview of that yeah so if you mean

134
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,290
some of you guys real last year in black

135
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,240
a tree that was in Amsterdam so we had a

136
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,370
talk on LTC caches we explained some

137
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,140
porgy and she catches how to build an

138
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,330
all those but now I'm not going to

139
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,980
detail just to give introduction briefly

140
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,840
about what with a conventional

141
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,580
implicature what they basically use now

142
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,380
the title says Wi-Fi way seems

143
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,600
so you may have a question in mind

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,850
whether you just crack the guy or

145
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,500
whether you also intercepting his data

146
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,840
communication or maybe or call for

147
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,690
example right so basically all the

148
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,280
duplicates it has a two purpose what

149
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,740
they use the first is purely about the

150
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,490
tracking so first they wanted to talk

151
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,870
like the users so this could be either

152
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,410
targeted attacks or maybe just just

153
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,700
listening all the surrounding users and

154
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,350
try clicking for fun guardian deity who

155
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,760
belongs to whom so there are multiple

156
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,980
ways of going to say targeted targeted

157
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,070
attacks or maybe just a random attack

158
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,960
the second is interception about okay

159
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,640
now once you crack the guy you know is

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,070
identity you fix you a target now so

161
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,530
what you could do from that now you can

162
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,170
ask him to attach to your MC catcher

163
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,510
like a stingray device and then you try

164
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,120
to intercept his call or sms now of

165
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,460
course you need a back-end support to to

166
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,320
let him feel that this is the right base

167
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,940
station you are talking in here and he

168
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,290
doesn't feel any interruption between

169
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,420
the call if he feels something of course

170
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,950
he gets alerted that something is bad

171
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,290
which is happening here so there has to

172
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,590
be a efficient connection to the

173
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,050
back-end telco provider by any means so

174
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,490
I'm not covering those mains but there

175
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,440
has to be a enough connection there has

176
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,110
to be a technical capability to connect

177
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,420
to this MC catcher back in the telecom

178
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,760
network so that if the normal guy is

179
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,500
making a landline call it should she was

180
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,030
able to make a landline caller mobile

181
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,280
call for example right so the second

182
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,170
part is about interception so same goes

183
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,850
apply with SMS and as well a data

184
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,830
connection now with the data connection

185
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,020
there is a possibility I wake up can we

186
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,880
come to the next slide with with with

187
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,250
the 2g and 3G differences and with

188
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,840
instigators of course operates on a

189
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,150
licensed mobile grants of frequency

190
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,170
bands and this could be gsm 3g and 4g in

191
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,910
the market right now we have seen

192
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,010
already GSM and 3G there are some

193
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,360
actually if you Google buy sell use

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,190
Google you know so find various

195
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,840
communication product which also says

196
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,690
that they operates on a 4G plan for GP

197
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,099
quinces advantage but the problem is

198
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,740
okay most of them claim they try to do

199
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,659
downgrading so basically they just jam

200
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,150
the frequency which is operate for 4G or

201
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,890
3G and they ask you to come back to

202
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,620
pootie so as you may aware that to here

203
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,150
lady has a lot of lots of problems there

204
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,920
is no mutual authentication and easy

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,619
you can we stop using a2g calls and it's

206
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,829
way easy then 3g and 4g so all the bands

207
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,109
available but it just it's a matter of

208
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,579
whether somebody is downloading you are

209
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:04,459
not done reading it and by definition of

210
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,230
course what this thing is a device

211
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,790
columns together means somebody just

212
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,160
bring some kind of device which is acts

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,139
like a base station nowadays the base

214
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,759
station size is not like a big mix you

215
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,199
see in the building so basically the

216
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,809
smallest size in the market or you may

217
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,220
guys have some actually if you live in

218
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,899
UK right now you can also buy this small

219
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,509
like a DSL modem boxes which is like

220
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,459
this station basically and you can also

221
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,499
like small device you can buy the buy

222
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,449
the device on and convert into him she

223
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,519
catches five is getting really long what

224
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,259
it does basically just try to connect

225
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:34,999
all in surrounding mobile phones which

226
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,649
has a limited range like a 50 meter

227
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,139
until depending on the RF capability of

228
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,489
your device and then you can ask the

229
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:43,429
devices to connect you and they operate

230
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,759
in a two mode which I somehow explained

231
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,100
initially so first is passive mode

232
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,899
passive means you are just acting as a

233
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,239
bad guy and listening on that is doing

234
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,279
nothing so you just looking at the

235
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,319
broadcast packets what you can see any

236
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,959
identity or any any parameters if

237
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,269
unfortunately if there is no encryption

238
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,309
there you may see some extra information

239
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,129
like calls and SMS but depending on in

240
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,540
there is encryption or not so the

241
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,459
passive like can't really do anything

242
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,249
but definitely he can try to infer the

243
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:16,100
MC because again now we are not going

244
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,529
details because next to appear will talk

245
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:19,819
about the Wi-Fi but in mobile networks

246
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,649
basically what happens if you're getting

247
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,660
a call like incoming call or data

248
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,730
connection what happens the base station

249
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,470
sends you the hi message which which

250
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,079
contains your identity so it could be

251
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
the MC which Pierce already explained or

252
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,879
it could be at MC or like another term

253
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,919
with which we using posey called G UT ID

254
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,769
so that may try to infer you this is you

255
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,019
guys and this is what the passive is

256
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,149
path instigator does it just monitors

257
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,919
everything on the RF sign and try to

258
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,119
infer your identity so there are

259
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,980
different techniques which we explained

260
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,259
in last year in active soil then

261
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,480
somebody just try to bring the base

262
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,399
station which tried to mimic as your

263
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,899
operator for example you are using a

264
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,149
Vodafone SIM card and the attacker will

265
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,619
set up this base station of the Vodafone

266
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,749
so your phone automatically sees there

267
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,360
is a Vodafone base station which has

268
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,179
max which has a nice signal strength and

269
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,980
our phone is designed such a way that

270
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,679
along and he sees a maximum powers plane

271
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,059
from the near base station if you just

272
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,679
try to connect the connector there

273
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,319
instead of the base station which has a

274
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,059
list of power so somebody can exploit

275
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,559
that vulnerability so somebody just

276
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,389
bring base station near to you so it

277
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,889
will just automatically disconnect from

278
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,059
the base station which is on the

279
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,199
building and if you connect to the

280
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,209
attackers which is nearby so this is

281
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,589
like cream cheek acid and this can be

282
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,929
used for intercepting your calls as well

283
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,629
because this is this has some capability

284
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,639
to support the call functionality or

285
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,069
internet functionality and also to

286
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,689
intercept your SMS because we need to

287
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:43,149
give the feel that the SMS is being

288
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,999
really delivered of course once you can

289
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,259
have in mind like okay I can drink

290
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:48,939
active base station and I will just

291
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:50,439
intercept every calls and I will not

292
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:51,970
deliver to the network but that's fine

293
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,069
but the user may get alert that okay I'm

294
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,660
sending I'm making a call everything

295
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,970
under its being ringing but actually

296
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,559
nobody is taking the call so he may feel

297
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,649
something weird so it's about without

298
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,749
detection so what is the cost on those

299
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,079
boxes basically so commercial solutions

300
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,329
are quite expensive if you wanted to buy

301
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,309
like a special MC catcher but now again

302
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:15,100
this statement is kind of bad if I stay

303
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,230
like this now if you just do Google

304
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,929
Alibaba you can just go on Alibaba or

305
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:22,209
find any other commercial tools Russian

306
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,040
and Chinese you may find that somebody's

307
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,649
trying to sale for $3,000 or maybe until

308
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,649
$50,000 and you can just buy this boxes

309
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,439
we originally these box boxes are only

310
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,360
allowed to buy or sell for the

311
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,309
government agencies but now you maybe

312
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,649
make it you can also buy those words or

313
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,119
you can build yourself with a just

314
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,429
laptop and there are lots of software

315
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,169
defined radio platforms where you can

316
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,449
install open-source software like much

317
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,749
more calm open BTS even the 3G version

318
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:54,220
we have open BTS UMTS plus the 4G sorry

319
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,899
open LT and install so if we have a

320
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,279
different variant which are used for the

321
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,989
research platforms but they can be also

322
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,939
convert into MC catch and this

323
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,610
technology of MC catches has been long

324
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,040
time since 1990 and it has been fighting

325
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,519
it first time pretended by the German

326
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:09,939
company

327
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,579
rohde & schwarz which was back in 1993

328
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,740
so there are also other patterns about

329
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,569
the sims ii catcher which the way you

330
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,220
track are the people around that

331
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,830
look for the information so before we

332
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,420
head to the main talks just to give a

333
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,310
difference between this 2g and 3G and

334
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,680
what we could do actually there and and

335
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,240
what is the flaw because now when we

336
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
talk about this next wireframes you get

337
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,450
said you will also see there are some

338
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,400
kind of the same similar kind of flaw we

339
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,410
exploit basically this is about the

340
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,240
design the way our mobile communication

341
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,100
work or authentication in the sim card

342
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,290
or the way users subscriber actually

343
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,540
authenticated on a 2g we know that they

344
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,730
exploit the protocol flaws when there is

345
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,260
a no mutual authentication between the

346
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,540
base station and mobile phone so this is

347
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,330
like a existing floor this can't we fix

348
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,250
for 2g communication unfortunately so it

349
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,630
allows for tracking an interception

350
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,070
somebody can just bring thick vegetation

351
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,990
say hey I'm this guy and let's talk

352
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,710
mobile phone can't do anything and the

353
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,650
saddest part in our site is that mobile

354
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,690
phone is always act as a dumb device in

355
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,550
the protocol communication so whatever

356
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,530
the base station tells do this it just

357
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,750
access let's do this so this has been

358
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,120
fixed in 3G and 4G the fake base station

359
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,370
comes and hey talk to me in a plain text

360
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,900
it will say no I'm not going to talk to

361
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,460
plain text at least he'll integrity

362
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,500
protection messages that he secretly use

363
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,060
a key integrity key to talk to each

364
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,140
other of course they can disable

365
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,300
encryption but there is a integrity key

366
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,740
whether you can trigger but this is only

367
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,140
available in 3G and 4G but not into G so

368
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,170
2g is completely problematic if somebody

369
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,730
brings a fake base station and the sizes

370
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,740
on the sea on the picture with this one

371
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,340
with a few GM 4G so again they exploit

372
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,630
the same architecture issues like

373
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,190
somebody can bring a big base station it

374
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,780
can get the identity but they can't

375
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,400
really have a key to talk to each other

376
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,130
after the authentication so still find

377
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,510
what somebody can easily track and

378
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,520
difficult to intercept and that's what

379
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,050
the claim because you see in media

380
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,000
article ok somewhat equal to 4 GHz

381
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
capture and they're trying to intercept

382
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,850
node this is not possible

383
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,140
because you're not going to get the key

384
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,790
which is used to talk to the

385
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,950
communication this key is only belonged

386
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,020
to the operator and and until unless you

387
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,180
have all the key material you can't

388
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,589
really decrypt anybody's calls or

389
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,210
communication even very good when you

390
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,870
are using a 4 GMC catcher and commercial

391
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,250
all the products in G capture they try

392
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,860
to downgrade you or use of legitimate

393
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,420
base station which is also possible like

394
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,070
in 2012 blackhat we have to talk about

395
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,050
using a femtocell which is like I said

396
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,760
small base station of roads you can buy

397
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,650
this this is like a small embedded Linux

398
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,170
box which you can compromise this box

399
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,540
you can act you can just root on the box

400
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,180
you can try to circumvent ipv6 I saw the

401
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,430
IPSec communication extract the key and

402
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,960
basically you see everything in plain

403
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,790
text and that's possible if you bring

404
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,350
this kind of solutions for 4G

405
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,839
interception acts as in C catcher that's

406
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,450
possible on the picture you see this is

407
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,770
like a small way station which is used

408
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,270
for the emergency purpose so what this

409
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,589
base station has this has a back-end

410
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,290
satellite connection and if somebody

411
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,790
brings this kind of solutions has a for

412
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,010
DMZ catcher in the backpack output then

413
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,780
actually can intercept every 4G call

414
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,280
that's complete this is called a

415
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,080
legitimate base station which has a

416
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,550
back-end support of some operator and

417
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,110
now you may question some shady

418
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,330
operators may have some connection to do

419
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,010
that but now okay what is the production

420
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,839
on these MC caches and why we have to

421
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,550
look in the white car right so there is

422
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,620
no protection available for the phone

423
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,480
which you carrying in your pocket now

424
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,459
like you if you have a iPhone your

425
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:23,140
Android phone your Windows Phone your

426
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,660
blackberry there is no such app can work

427
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,220
effectively to detect this kind of

428
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,959
attacks like somebody is really tracking

429
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,450
you are not tracking you okay there are

430
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,040
some special tools there are some apps

431
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,110
available but the special phones can

432
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,950
only act as an I would say some limited

433
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,420
options you have there so those those

434
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,800
are the phones which support sent it

435
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
could calls as well they cancel they can

436
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,220
acted they can have a special tools as a

437
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,080
firewall for the base band which can try

438
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,820
to prevent those traits they can try to

439
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,470
be take the silent SMS and all those

440
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,070
nasty attacks but those are expensive

441
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,230
the cost is really go until I don't know

442
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,820
exactly exact price with lot and I

443
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,560
remember from the price from the guys

444
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,990
dimension of about 3500 used to load

445
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,520
something around that and there are some

446
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,770
apps which we also develop at self like

447
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,510
we I have a talking Ida talking black a

448
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,640
2014 about app called their check we

449
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,220
develop that app to detect MC catches

450
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,380
but this was only works on Samsung

451
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,300
phones samsung galaxy s3 which has an

452
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,630
Intel based band and the later s our

453
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,069
labs in Germany they also introduce the

454
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,569
app called smoothly so you can install

455
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,010
those apps and try to get acclaim she

456
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,929
catches right so this also was what you

457
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,579
need to route the for and not every

458
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,590
normal user could do that but now again

459
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,000
it comes to the back so what is the

460
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,920
protection you can turn off your flight

461
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,360
more you can go into flight mode and you

462
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,890
can just use a Wi-Fi for your all the

463
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,450
communication and you are still secure

464
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,100
right and now this used to be

465
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,929
commentator this is the best protection

466
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,490
somebody could suggest so use like a

467
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,960
Wi-Fi or use

468
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,549
Multi hotspot technology like bring

469
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,820
another phone and take this spoon as a

470
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,070
hotspot Wi-Fi hotspot and then connect

471
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,500
your phone to this middle phone then

472
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
basically if somebody attacks they can

473
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,770
try to attack this spoon which doesn't

474
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,149
belong to your identity and then you can

475
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,220
use this your phone attached as a Wi-Fi

476
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,620
so basically we had a intermediate layer

477
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,289
which to talk get total out there or you

478
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,809
can just use a Wi-Fi but now Wi-Fi has a

479
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,520
different things and that's what we're

480
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,230
talking this that's what we try to

481
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,580
introduce in this talk due to the

482
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,649
convergence of all telecommuting

483
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,090
technologies and everybody just want to

484
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,610
use now Wi-Fi calling our Wi-Fi features

485
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,350
and why this is just a technical terms

486
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,909
about just before I handle it appears

487
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:24,039
because mobile operators are running out

488
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,320
of the so they try to introduce new

489
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,909
techno technologies because you don't

490
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,409
get the coverage inside the house or

491
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,720
inside the office buildings right and at

492
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,240
that time you can't use the normal

493
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,700
mobile connection or signaling soap or

494
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,559
you can't do either you introduce this

495
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,360
small base station or now they are

496
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,570
supporting to use Wi-Fi to use your

497
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,669
normal mobile functions so you will be

498
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,289
using Wi-Fi but basically you will use

499
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,570
all your billing plan what we have on a

500
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,640
SIM card and that's we definitely do

501
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,770
some new traits which now pyramids try

502
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,450
to introduce you with the Y prime

503
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,049
sketcher

504
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:00,399
okay thanks Ravi yeah so basically

505
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,370
talking about the Wi-Fi based MC capture

506
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,700
as Ravi mentioned some of the

507
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,710
conventional MC captures provide forum

508
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,610
additional services like interception

509
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,830
that they have r1 provides for basically

510
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,950
picking up detecting the MC and

511
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,440
essentially working out the location

512
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,059
potentially working out the location

513
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,190
from that I mean typically if you can

514
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,260
catch the MC whether it's a conventional

515
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,799
one or or r1 you typically need to be

516
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,309
co-located with the with the target and

517
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,809
so you kind of know roughly where they

518
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,309
are but so this our system allows you to

519
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,380
basically extract the MC but not

520
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,320
actually intercept the calls and it

521
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,350
operates in the is M bans the industrial

522
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,740
scientific medical bands which in which

523
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,139
Wi-Fi operates typically in 2.4

524
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:57,639
gigahertz or five

525
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,139
five gigahertz there's others as well so

526
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,570
the range is Wi-Fi range although course

527
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,729
that can be extended you see these kind

528
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,709
of things people will stick in Pringles

529
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,659
packets and and all that kind of stuff

530
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,509
to extend the range I mean it can be can

531
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,289
be done with more sophisticated

532
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:16,929
approaches so you can get quite a bit

533
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,200
more range out of Wi-Fi basically and it

534
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,079
operates by well I'm going to go into

535
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,209
the detail one one approaches of a fake

536
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:29,889
access point and then other the other

537
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:32,139
technique is about either sort of

538
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,739
spoofing redirecting traffic to a

539
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:38,379
operator data gateway and we're

540
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,869
exploiting weaknesses in the protocol or

541
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,079
configuration to achieve this so

542
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,399
basically just said we've them the MC

543
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:53,159
caches based upon two techniques the

544
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:58,229
Wi-Fi network authentication which is

545
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:01,859
one portion as if it's defined in this

546
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,169
3gpp the a mobile standards body

547
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:11,019
basically in standard TS 33.2 34 who

548
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,119
needs to know the details and these are

549
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,070
this is how they refer to within in the

550
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,459
spec they call it WLAN direct IP access

551
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:22,929
and then Wi-Fi calling authentication is

552
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,440
referred to as W and 3gpp IP access and

553
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,409
we've discovered issues in these two

554
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:34,899
technologies and the costs this is of

555
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,969
course pretty low and basically

556
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,459
virtually any Wi-Fi capable of computer

557
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,589
so anything from a laptop kind of

558
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:44,229
downwards Raspberry Pi that allows P PI

559
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:46,809
3 has a little inbuilt Wi-Fi these days

560
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:52,299
and just quite handy so just looking

561
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,519
briefly at some the Wi-Fi network

562
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,320
attachment sort of when you win when a

563
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,269
device when the phones or tries to

564
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,549
connect to the network and what kind of

565
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,109
networks are there out there will a sort

566
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:06,429
of unencrypted Wi-Fi access points no

567
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,409
password basically but then they often

568
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:09,819
have something called a captive portal

569
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,080
which is the sort of little sheet

570
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,730
pops up when you try and connect to them

571
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,649
and they'll ask you for some credentials

572
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:19,120
potentially or just type in your email

573
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,640
address or whatever it is massively

574
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,980
based on something called whisper this

575
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,919
protocol although it can be based on a

576
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,990
bunch of weird hacks as well it's it's a

577
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,960
bit of a messy area of course if they

578
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,230
can just be completely open as well

579
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,789
Google interests interestingly enough on

580
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,890
Google's and fie service and relies upon

581
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,309
open Wi-Fi access points it says and it

582
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,870
then it sets up a little VPN which they

583
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,909
use but it's not really available here

584
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,820
so we've had a brief dig into it

585
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,590
Bradbury and found anything particularly

586
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,950
interesting so far

587
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,630
normal encrypted Wi-Fi access points

588
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,190
were the sort of pre shared password

589
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,649
credentials which you use to then get

590
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:07,750
you connected and then there's these

591
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,429
auto connect Wi-Fi access points I mean

592
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:16,330
there are some in sort of like companies

593
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,779
run them in things but then the RISM

594
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:22,539
there are different types of way the

595
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:26,470
automatic Wi-Fi access points work but

596
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,789
specifically we're looking at these

597
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:33,510
access points that are essentially

598
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,340
managed well not they're basically

599
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,049
managed by the mobile operators and they

600
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:45,669
allow a mobile phone to negotiate to

601
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:49,409
basically connect to the Wi-Fi network

602
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,130
automatically without any user

603
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,309
intervention and and it does this by

604
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,169
using the credentials in the sim card

605
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:02,710
basically the MC and the key and this is

606
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,389
controlled by operator provider

607
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,880
configuration that gets loaded onto the

608
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,840
phone so it can either be users have to

609
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,440
configure it manually or there is there

610
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,000
is some automatic type of configuration

611
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,700
so it's a little closer look at those

612
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,549
automatic configurations because those

613
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:23,740
basically mean that

614
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,270
nudists your phone kind of without you

615
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,070
particularly I'm asking for it

616
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,530
we'll just your operators configured the

617
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,600
phones to automatically connect to

618
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,830
certain Wi-Fi networks so a lot of big

619
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,730
big brands have their sort of auto Wi-Fi

620
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,100
networks you'll see that often sort of

621
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,000
said Auto ATT or Auto EE or and then

622
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,470
there are sort of more obscure ones Oh

623
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,470
tunes and Wi-Fi extra and Vodafone Wi-Fi

624
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,320
this there's a bunch of them I mean

625
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,970
they're they're quite handy because

626
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,280
basically they they allow the phone just

627
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,280
connects to Wi-Fi and just you get to

628
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,290
the fallback to Wi-Fi so you get faster

629
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,670
data connection depending on where you

630
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,580
are but this it works in actually

631
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,410
automatic configuration is is is set up

632
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,600
on on actually a number of Android and

633
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,840
Windows phones because if you look at

634
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,020
some of the web pages for some of these

635
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,630
operator offerings they say that certain

636
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,309
brands are phones and it includes

637
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:37,690
Windows Android and iOS we've had a bit

638
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,900
of a closer look at io s iOS also

639
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,540
configures the phones based upon the

640
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,809
inserted sim and actor activates an

641
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:49,980
operator specific mobile config file and

642
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,600
then that then configured the device

643
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,950
depending on what sims in there to have

644
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,870
a bunch of pre-configured auto Wi-Fi

645
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,900
lists in there and we do a brief

646
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,340
analysis of iOS 9 and found more than 50

647
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,400
profiles nearly 60 odd profiles

648
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,960
containing auto Wi-Fi type networks

649
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,240
there's also a bunch of other

650
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,090
configuration in there manual ones um so

651
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,550
some and some Android devices require

652
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:32,980
manual config so you basically have to

653
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,630
follow the instructions on on an

654
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,220
operator website and it's as pretty

655
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,460
simple sort of stuff

656
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,590
you just happen on network and then

657
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,960
select in the drop-down like sort of

658
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,370
seeing it said as the the authentication

659
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,080
technique and then once you've done that

660
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,020
once then it then connects to those to

661
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,770
that Network then repeatedly and then

662
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,900
Android also provides some additional

663
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,720
carrier control mechanisms and in the

664
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,840
Seoul newer versions of Android ISM the

665
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,410
various sort of API is basically coming

666
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,280
out that allow for configuring of the

667
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,920
phone based upon carrier profiles so

668
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,330
this automatic Wi-Fi authentication

669
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,000
having a closer look at that that is

670
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,040
sort of yet another standards body the I

671
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,510
Triple E and 802 dot 1x and which is

672
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,070
important at work

673
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,940
access control which basically defines

674
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,660
the use of a protocol called extensible

675
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,770
authentication protocol or eat so for

676
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,040
short which is defined by the IETF the

677
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,860
internet Engineering Task Force and that

678
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,020
basically specifies transporting of this

679
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,830
eep protocol over over the land over

680
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,820
over Wi-Fi or over like we thin out or

681
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,650
whatever so it's called a pole EEP over

682
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,250
there anyway so this is rather a lot of

683
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,520
those sort of standards kind of being

684
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,850
put together and in our case looking

685
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,520
specifically at what's happening when

686
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,910
the phone tries to connect to the one of

687
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,920
these auto Wi-Fi networks it's based

688
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,210
upon two particular methods one the

689
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:36,050
first one EAP sim which is it's

690
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,460
specified in in an internet Engineering

691
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,420
Task Force standard and it is based upon

692
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,300
Zoar GSM security model with some

693
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,720
enhancements so there so

694
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,080
it's actually slightly better than just

695
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,000
the basic GSM approach but it and it

696
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,760
does have some issues but it is

697
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,909
currently the most widely used at the

698
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:09,169
moment for phones to connect to the to

699
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:12,950
the to the Wi-Fi networks the results

700
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,740
are something called eat akka which it's

701
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,850
based upon 3G and security and and that

702
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,130
is designed to be deployed that provides

703
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:28,070
a stronger connection but unfortunately

704
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,470
both of these and have the issue that we

705
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,299
discovered which we'll talk about them

706
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,020
shortly

707
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,169
the support for these protocols is is

708
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:43,640
actually implemented in Android iOS

709
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,039
Windows Mobile blackberries are

710
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,580
basically mostly world smart phones and

711
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,610
we we've been the good guys we we spoke

712
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,100
to Apple and Microsoft and Blackberry

713
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,470
and they'll they kind of got around to

714
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,360
replying acknowledged there was an issue

715
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,820
and an app Apple have been probably

716
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,840
carrying a flag on it a bit they did

717
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,970
take things forward and they actually

718
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,240
deployed developed a new feature to go

719
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,890
into iOS 10 as a result of them of our

720
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,600
discussions with them something called

721
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,330
conservative peer which I can explain in

722
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,309
a moment it's basically due to the to

723
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,020
the interactions we've had with them so

724
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,340
we've been talking them for like over

725
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,620
six months about this issue and we've

726
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,580
also talked to the to the GSMA the GSM

727
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,049
Association which is basically

728
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,270
represents some kind of most of the

729
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,120
world's operators gave a talk to them

730
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,799
about the issue a couple of months back

731
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,990
and just sort of raised awareness there

732
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,230
that maybe because it's such a big issue

733
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,240
no one's really thinks I was my fault so

734
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,670
maybe a world made of all

735
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,290
privacy bounty or something like that no

736
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,200
one no one kind of quite feels that they

737
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
can they can stop it so there's no

738
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,790
there's no kind of bounties involved in

739
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:18,610
this work but it's it's it's it's

740
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,860
something that we're looking to try to

741
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,470
get fixed but it's a feature that's

742
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,530
useful for most people so it's being

743
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,790
deployed in many countries and the

744
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,530
adoption is growing so be good to sort

745
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,630
it out so basically it comes down to

746
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,240
they eat same and eat acha these two

747
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,700
protocols I mentioned the identities

748
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,950
that are exchanged in these protocols

749
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,530
and there are three basic types of

750
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,270
identity used in the authentication

751
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,840
phase and well the one of them

752
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,430
particular interest is what's called the

753
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,270
permanent identity and which is in this

754
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:03,220
case is the is the MC and typically the

755
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,640
permanent identity is exchanged but the

756
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,920
kind of initially basically when the

757
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,750
phone first the trans to the network and

758
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,960
tries to connect to the Wi-Fi and after

759
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,460
that then then there's going to be these

760
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,540
temporary IDs which are the next two

761
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,830
there's what's called a pseudonym

762
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,050
identity which is basically a kind of

763
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,860
them it's what's a pseudonym for the for

764
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,900
the MC so it's not the MC but it kind of

765
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,720
fits like it and it has a it has a sort

766
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,750
of a lifetime so then you can view your

767
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,730
phone then will and send over the

768
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,530
pseudonym so then if someone sees that

769
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,450
so flying of the wired and they're not

770
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,590
this is already going to say that's

771
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,490
audits as that guy DMC but then the

772
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,470
protocol needs to exchange these

773
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,940
pseudonyms and renew them and so on so

774
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,290
there are some issues around using

775
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,630
pseudonyms then there's another one

776
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,670
called the fast real indication identity

777
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,010
which is an a sort of lower overhead

778
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,270
identifier basically because the first

779
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,290
interaction when you're using the M the

780
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,510
MC to actually do proper check on it

781
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,400
your phone so hands over

782
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,170
MC and then that gets handed in to the

783
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,430
network and then the net were then

784
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,570
ultimately has to go to the kind of

785
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,000
back-end system ins also like whereas

786
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,920
this guy's MC and where's the key and

787
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,290
let's do the proper cut the graphic

788
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,040
exchange and so that's done on initial

789
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,480
connection but then you think at this

790
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,080
fast relent ocation ID which is then can

791
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,690
then be used so it can just be used in

792
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,780
the sort of the more the edge system so

793
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,970
they can then just uncashed that fast

794
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,380
rate of indication ID and then do a

795
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,450
quick way authentication when you kind

796
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,160
of come back so like for example on the

797
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,110
London Underground it'll pop between

798
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,150
stations and you'll reopen to gate every

799
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,210
time so it speeds Duff up like that and

800
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,100
walking down the street there be

801
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,770
multiple access points you don't have to

802
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,750
talk into the kind of deep end of the

803
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,668
operator back systems so those are the

804
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:13,699
three and then the actual behavior is is

805
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:16,010
affected by and what about the peer

806
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,760
policy so there's a sort of current

807
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,668
default is called liberal peer which

808
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:27,710
basically in this protocol you can solve

809
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,880
say give me your best identifiers and

810
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,100
typically your best one if you've got a

811
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,600
fast real authentic ation one you'll

812
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:42,050
send that one and and but you can also

813
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,320
say give me your permanent identifiers

814
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,929
and and with liberal peer phone ss-sure

815
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:54,469
here's my is my MC so and it'll just

816
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,659
hand it over

817
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,880
but with conservative peer which is a

818
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,480
sort of future deployment option and

819
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,610
it's it's part of the it's in spec but

820
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,890
it's not generally being implemented but

821
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,290
it has now been implemented in iOS 10 I

822
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,870
mean it may be in Android in some of the

823
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,790
newer versions but I'm I've been in

824
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,990
touch with Google but they haven't

825
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,370
specifically mentioned it conservative

826
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,770
peer only responds to requests for

827
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,380
permanent identity as in your mg when

828
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,160
there's no pseudonym I didn't

829
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,769
available so it basically makes it a bit

830
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:36,420
a bit harder to extract the the MC from

831
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,049
from the device so how is this actual

832
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,089
conversation that we've been discussing

833
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:48,410
how does it since how does this EAP sim

834
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,089
work like what happens of the packets

835
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:55,170
and typically eep is a this is general

836
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,920
there are lots of sort of methods and

837
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,329
it's an authentication protocol if

838
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,690
exchanges sort of them kind of basically

839
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,549
some kind of credentials and it's not

840
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:10,200
encrypted it's not encrypted sort of

841
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,500
them interchange and currently eat sim

842
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,960
ibaka when it's run a poll sort of over

843
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,680
over land this 802 dot 1x the way that

844
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,869
it's deployed at the moment is

845
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:30,839
unfortunately unencrypted so thus the MC

846
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,460
is visible to a passive attack when a

847
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,690
permanent identity EMC is used for full

848
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,180
authentication so an initial connection

849
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,529
and then it's also it can be revealed if

850
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:51,180
if there's an active attack basically by

851
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,720
and requesting for authentication which

852
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,789
the to solve uglies on this one so it

853
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:03,779
means that they can that can be obtained

854
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:09,569
and we have it's it's um we tested this

855
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:12,869
out but I mean you'll be happy to hear

856
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:16,380
that as we mentioned earlier the actual

857
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,099
content is is feel protected so why one

858
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,349
can get PMC you can't actually and you

859
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:25,470
can observe the the whole interaction

860
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,890
this authentication interaction but like

861
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,980
with a few well most of them

862
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,079
cryptography you can look at the sort of

863
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,119
cryptographic interchange and you can't

864
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,690
actually work out what's being not being

865
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,150
said necessarily them and the key the

866
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,779
key exchange

867
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:45,179
process is designed so that the keys

868
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,099
aren't actually transported in the clear

869
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,559
they're there and negotiated at each

870
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,329
endpoint and retained there so content

871
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,979
is still protected now there are systems

872
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:02,390
basically protocols that can allow for

873
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,400
protection and basically encryption of

874
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,789
the interchange like for example EAP TLS

875
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,559
or TTL SV zeros is typically M as it's

876
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,650
currently sort of defined and EAP TLS

877
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:26,809
they are potential ways of protecting it

878
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:31,380
but they do then require support in the

879
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,949
mobile OS and the operator and all the

880
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,390
vendor systems so that it can be

881
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,919
deployed so that's that's that's the

882
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:45,319
first approach sort of covered and I'll

883
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:48,749
give a give a demo on that so basically

884
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:52,349
the MC can be revealed in this in this

885
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:54,029
some interaction when a mobile phone

886
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:57,299
tries to and connect to a Wi-Fi network

887
00:38:57,299 --> 00:39:00,449
that has this which is configured to use

888
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:04,409
this EAP sim or EAP akka in the current

889
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:09,539
and current configuration so moving on

890
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:10,949
to the next one the Wi-Fi calling

891
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,549
connection so what happens here when a

892
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:20,789
phone is using Wi-Fi to make a call this

893
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:23,069
is this is the Wi-Fi calling stuff

894
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,219
that's actually built into the OS

895
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:29,880
typically so iOS has sort of had it for

896
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,119
a while and believer Android has had it

897
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,809
for a while and I think Windows have

898
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:39,269
I've had it too but it's sort of

899
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,599
starting to rise in terms of deployment

900
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,019
and usage because it is rarely mentioned

901
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,769
I mean this it provides it offload and

902
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:51,630
in black spots and stuff like that you

903
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,479
can you can use Wi-Fi if this is

904
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,060
different from

905
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,020
all sort of over-the-top apps like

906
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,810
whatever whatsapp signal all the rest of

907
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,780
them and this is actually working with

908
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,330
the operator so what happens is the

909
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,610
phone attempts to attach to what

910
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,590
attempts to connect to something till

911
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,260
the edge packet data gateway over Wi-Fi

912
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,420
and it can make voice calls over this

913
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,080
connection and the phone will attempt to

914
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,140
connect to the to the edge packet data

915
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,190
gateway when it's in areas of low signal

916
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:36,020
or it will also connect when it goes

917
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,120
into airplane mode and then you flip on

918
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,610
the Wi-Fi interestingly enough and

919
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,450
that's why I go show in the demo so the

920
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,440
connection to the EPD G uses an eclipse

921
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,800
ACK this IP security protocol which

922
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,730
people were aware of and there's a

923
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,500
there's an exchange at the I'm at the

924
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,130
beginning of most if set connections and

925
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,910
which is called

926
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,890
to do the authentication and key setup

927
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,690
and the particular protocol used air is

928
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,960
called the M is called Ike internet key

929
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,660
exchange protocol version 2 right now

930
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,530
I'm version one was a few years back had

931
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,080
some problems so there to cook up a new

932
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,040
one so and this is as I said supported

933
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,220
iOS Android and Windows and Wi-Fi

934
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,570
calling available a bunch of countries

935
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,890
and again we've we've mentioned this one

936
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,880
to the to the OS guys and to the

937
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,610
operators and it's of aware of the

938
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,830
situation but it is a bit of a systemic

939
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,610
kind of thing it will choirs a bit of

940
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,980
work so anyway let's go into the details

941
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,230
here it's a quick overview we it

942
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,350
basically provides for authentication

943
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,780
confidentiality and would these them to

944
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,370
aah and ESP doing is

945
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,450
actually encrypting the payloads

946
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,000
encrypting the voice key management is

947
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,240
then done by this something called Ike

948
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,060
v2 and you've got two modes you've got

949
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,880
what's called tunnel mode which is used

950
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,350
connection to the Gateway so like any

951
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,240
any packets from potentially different

952
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,280
entities on our network we turn send

953
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,840
through a tunnel you know transport mode

954
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,740
which is just direct them point-to-point

955
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,000
so what happens in this internet key

956
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,340
exchange well there are two phases

957
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,560
there's something called the I guess a

958
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,290
in it which negotiates and cryptographic

959
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,470
algorithms and exchanges and just stuff

960
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,120
like nonces and everything and does

961
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,360
something called diffie-hellman exchange

962
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,180
which basically sets up a key pair to

963
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:57,520
encrypt the the following exchange the

964
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,460
iCore exchange at which point identities

965
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:09,880
are exchanged in our case in using using

966
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:19,480
a packer in this case and so the MC is

967
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,440
being is being transported now it is it

968
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,400
is encrypted here but unfortunately this

969
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,070
this initial exchange not actually

970
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:34,380
protected by a certificate right now so

971
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,810
you can set up a man-in-the-middle and

972
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,790
basically pretend to be an EP D G the

973
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,990
phone will connect to it and and then

974
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,310
it'll basically say here's my MC so

975
00:43:50,310 --> 00:44:01,080
another right yeah and so sorry

976
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:06,070
basically that is the second issue so

977
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:10,000
the MC is then revealed in this

978
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,430
situation as well so it's basically to

979
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:18,100
two separate techniques to extract the

980
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,470
NC from from

981
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:25,890
smartphones the the actual core content

982
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,900
again is still protected so it's it's

983
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,730
just an identity attack so what kind of

984
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,400
mitigations are there well I think one

985
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,890
of the things that I think is is it'll

986
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,560
be good sort out with move move off of

987
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,510
the a PCM as default and move towards

988
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,150
Acker because the a PCM is weaker

989
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,740
because it uses some of the GSM

990
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,230
[Music]

991
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,700
cryptographic technology which isn't

992
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,099
quite as strong as the EAP accra

993
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,530
approach but there aren't any YB no and

994
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,580
sort of attacks on it the other thing is

995
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,530
to deploy this conservative peer mode of

996
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,340
operation using world potentially with

997
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,770
MEAP seen even but preferably with the

998
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,650
AP akka and then looking at a

999
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:25,440
certificate based approach which you

1000
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,920
would then require investing in putting

1001
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,240
certificates into the Triple A

1002
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,570
infrastructure and and then would then

1003
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,300
provide for protected tunnels for the

1004
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,150
EAP a couple Waveline access and forum

1005
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:44,550
and for the Wi-Fi tolling so basically

1006
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,410
using this product I talked about EAP

1007
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:53,099
sim EAP TTLs plus an EAP akka then the

1008
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,800
rather looking at other potential

1009
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,720
solutions like encrypting the AMC and

1010
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,920
then there are other source standards

1011
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,960
that have been mentioned as possible

1012
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,260
ways of protecting the MC so reads the

1013
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,849
source standards bodies to either take a

1014
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:10,530
take another look at this because there

1015
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,119
are kind of solutions in there they're

1016
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,980
just not really being deployed and

1017
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,970
they're more expensive to deploy I guess

1018
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,339
but then it depends on how much you um

1019
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,670
feel that should be protected and so

1020
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,040
mobile OS mitigations well we need to

1021
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,599
support some of these protocols that

1022
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,300
we're talking about so conservative

1023
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,809
[Music]

1024
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:33,029
conservative peer sudonym support and

1025
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:34,469
then you've got to support the actions

1026
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:36,029
to the good based approaches implement

1027
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:38,579
those in the OSS and then we have a

1028
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:39,929
thing that would be nice is to allow a

1029
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:42,149
bit more um user choice over automatic

1030
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:44,429
Wi-Fi network access which currently is

1031
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:47,039
a bit tricky preferably allowing

1032
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,140
allowing for editing all stored

1033
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,890
associations so we do use a mitigation

1034
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,649
well with iOS you can you can go and

1035
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,249
actually if you're near one of these

1036
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:01,919
automatic Wi-Fi networks you can

1037
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,989
actually tap on thing tap on the little

1038
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,089
either lympho thing and then say don't

1039
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,869
auto join and then as I mentioned the

1040
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,479
conservative peer in iOS Android we've

1041
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:16,799
got you can forget the other settings

1042
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:19,919
there and for the for the auto Wi-Fi

1043
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:22,439
again similarly and you can selectively

1044
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,269
turn off Wi-Fi calling if you want on

1045
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:26,969
the phone as well and Trust in

1046
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,409
environments probably not a bad idea to

1047
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:32,219
turn off Wi-Fi summary so we've got

1048
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,889
these two two points where we found

1049
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,829
weaknesses and most of the world's

1050
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,269
smartphones implement these protocols

1051
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:42,479
but it does rely these techniques rely

1052
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,309
upon the installed operator

1053
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:45,959
configurations so the phones are

1054
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:47,459
actually automatically trying to connect

1055
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:49,079
to these services they don't do that

1056
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,899
necessarily by default but major

1057
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:54,929
operators to provide that config so

1058
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,729
we've been working with these guys but

1059
00:47:56,729 --> 00:47:59,429
it is a complicated issue so it take a

1060
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:02,339
while so we'd be doing this some going

1061
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,659
to look into more stuff we're doing this

1062
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,369
under this fight to ensure all European

1063
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:08,359
project and we're looking further into

1064
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:12,299
these things so I just I'm just going to

1065
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:16,049
give a quick demo and whoops see if we

1066
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:22,999
can slide our way out of here so

1067
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,210
so what we got here is whoops I'll turn

1068
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,339
that off for now now what I'm going to

1069
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:36,020
do is only the wife I call the entity

1070
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,150
catcher so what this is going to do is

1071
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,900
going to set up a little access point

1072
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,760
running in a virtual machine on the

1073
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,680
laptop so well I can run up Wi-Fi and

1074
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,780
then it'll it'll them you'll show a

1075
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,230
bunch of so now I'm going to kick kick

1076
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,460
off the Wi-Fi column to catch up and

1077
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,690
we'll see in a second that the the

1078
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,270
furnace and just go and give a full scan

1079
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,280
right so where are we there we are

1080
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,010
this little guy here Wi-Fi calling so

1081
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:13,250
I'm going to tap on that one I'm going

1082
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,000
to join my this one with centered to

1083
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,740
simulate an access point so we've gotta

1084
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,630
wait for the tick it obtains an address

1085
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:28,160
and then I'll bring up there we are some

1086
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,450
got the tick so we're connected to the

1087
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,150
tab it to the network cool and there

1088
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,619
straight off we see the DMC now I have

1089
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:38,869
sort of obfuscation that one so that's

1090
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:41,299
the one from the slides but it's

1091
00:49:41,299 --> 00:49:43,579
basically a script where I'm just

1092
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:47,030
dumping it and it sits there trying to

1093
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,130
connect to the Wi-Fi calling server and

1094
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,240
I'm doing a man-in-the-middle attack on

1095
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,530
on the on the phone basically and

1096
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,809
running running a fake endpoint and then

1097
00:49:59,809 --> 00:50:06,619
dumping the DMC there so then I'm going

1098
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:13,369
to do the Wi-Fi network catcher so now

1099
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:18,020
you'll see that the Wi-Fi calling whoops

1100
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,170
was trying to connect a purple them now

1101
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,480
let's kick this guy off now what we've

1102
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,819
got here is we click on creating a bogus

1103
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:30,799
access point which is going to be doing

1104
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:35,140
which is sort pertaining to be a sort of

1105
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,010
a network that is going to steal the

1106
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,080
creds for the Wi-Fi network

1107
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,500
authentication and we're running

1108
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,680
Wireshark here in the terminal to dump

1109
00:50:50,680 --> 00:51:00,280
the traffic now this guy is and the by

1110
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,720
sec of anyone been waiting yeah

1111
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:09,100
currently this one is not been found

1112
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,520
sorry sorry say ok

1113
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,470
follow that yeah it's a very tricky one

1114
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,150
aspect here I think I can make it a

1115
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:24,870
little bit bigger but it appears to be

1116
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:33,870
unfortunately more cables

1117
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:45,460
this one is unfortunately not working

1118
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,100
sadly and I do have a demo of this one a

1119
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,700
little video and ok so far there we have

1120
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,780
got it right there we are see we now so

1121
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,820
I'm done I'm running a Wireshark for

1122
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,710
those of you familiar so you'll then

1123
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:03,820
again be able to see it is connecting

1124
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,700
well it's it's it's it doesn't always

1125
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,530
show you on the screen but what it does

1126
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,000
is automatically tries to connect to

1127
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,530
networks or than those so this one I've

1128
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,040
called this auto eat Wi-Fi so then you

1129
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,600
think tries to connect but then it fails

1130
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:22,450
but in in doing so it it's we're dumping

1131
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:26,170
the EEP interchange and you can see this

1132
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,620
is just you know running as Ravi said in

1133
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,260
monitor mode so it's just capturing the

1134
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,150
traffic flowing over the network so

1135
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,360
there's no decryption being done here so

1136
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:43,870
we see again the MC revealed actually

1137
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,570
what what biggest rate here of what he

1138
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,010
mentioned horror

1139
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,930
just now we finish in this light like

1140
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,280
you have a iPhone right everybody has

1141
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,650
iPhone so actually need iPhone all these

1142
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,240
profiles like what you mentioned are the

1143
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,490
Wi-Fi calling are actually locally

1144
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:01,030
stored by default by the by the Apple

1145
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,160
actually so you can dump out the

1146
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,530
database and he can set up his laptop as

1147
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,320
an access point so all your iPhone which

1148
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,330
already have this profile automatically

1149
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,740
connect to this Wi-Fi without even

1150
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,890
asking as long as your Wi-Fi is on you

1151
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,260
don't need to click on connect and if

1152
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,180
you just have Wi-Fi on basically he can

1153
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,950
just take everybody to MC and can show

1154
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,620
you it here this is only badly affected

1155
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,330
with iPhones actually and this is the

1156
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,960
biggest folio for iPhone and this is I

1157
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,910
did notice this is also which matter you

1158
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,160
can take this on a bunch of Android and

1159
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,890
and Windows Phones yeah so it's

1160
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,360
basically a trade that people to look at

1161
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,800
that was happening in the background so

1162
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,450
you can't really control on that so

1163
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,610
might as you saw my phone automatically

1164
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,070
connected to that EAP SIM am access

1165
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,540
point I had it I had set it up

1166
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,400
previously to the demo and therefore

1167
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,290
ride it was sort of connected to another

1168
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,290
network but it tries to connect and you

1169
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,270
and we were doing the packet dumb and

1170
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,340
you could see you could see a connecting

1171
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:02,860
to to that network so yeah

1172
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,030
so there those are basically the two

1173
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:06,940
issues and we have been working with

1174
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,600
vendors and well mostly operators know s

1175
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,240
people to to try and move this forward

1176
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,580
but I think it comes a point we have

1177
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,350
sort of spread the word that bit further

1178
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,090
that's sort of a see that there is

1179
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,330
actually an issue here and it should be

1180
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,760
fixed but it's it's a complex issue so

1181
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,190
it's not like you can't just solve say

1182
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,940
go go patch that that little that little

1183
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,820
bug it's a question of getting the

1184
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,850
standards right and getting getting

1185
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,740
people to implement those and this item

1186
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,270
that it's actually worth while I mean I

1187
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,970
guess at some point it's this this

1188
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,370
actual sort of vulnerability if you like

1189
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,320
is written about understand that it's

1190
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,090
impossible they say it's a possible

1191
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,880
issue

1192
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,070
identity compromise is is is mentioned

1193
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:00,569
in this all security considerations but

1194
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:03,660
I think it's also about how technology's

1195
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,779
moved on and how easy it is to get all

1196
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:09,359
of these things now I guess there's some

1197
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,579
of these standards of getting on a bit

1198
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:18,839
the pap CMS from 2006 and so there's

1199
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:22,140
some well maybe then they thought it was

1200
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,419
just that bit more difficult for people

1201
00:55:24,419 --> 00:55:25,890
to do that to the thing and it was I

1202
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:26,880
guess it would definitely the case with

1203
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,479
mobile spectrum and now you can buy kind

1204
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:34,169
of SDR kit for a few hundred dollars or

1205
00:55:34,169 --> 00:55:38,549
less by the old party lsdm for 15 bucks

1206
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:42,449
to sort of passively sniff on and some

1207
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:43,949
of the mobile spectrum so it's all

1208
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:46,140
become a lot cheaper and more more easy

1209
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,019
to then consequently it's all security

1210
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,039
solutions need to sort of move up as

1211
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,359
well so I don't know if anyone has any

1212
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:03,199
more questions and top of the font size

1213
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:07,949
this is the way you'll be in jail there

1214
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:11,579
is no way oh forget the IMEI no no I

1215
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:13,890
mean yeah you can get the IMEI if you do

1216
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,739
like a well uh sort of 2g kind of

1217
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,749
conventional NC attack you can't you

1218
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:20,549
can't get it there I mean not not right

1219
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:22,140
now we haven't we haven't come up with a

1220
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:27,390
way / yeah I mean that that's the thing

1221
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:30,329
I mean you or you can potentially even

1222
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:32,309
link it's a sort of linking you can

1223
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:33,839
potentially link the MC with the MAC

1224
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,449
address which is something which is but

1225
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:39,900
then the MCM a problem yeah sorry the MC

1226
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,189
is actually there are other ways to

1227
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,739
interact to confirm your phone number

1228
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:45,419
you can't link the MAC address with your

1229
00:56:45,419 --> 00:56:47,069
phone number that's a problem regimes

1230
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:48,419
you can link with the phone number n

1231
00:56:48,419 --> 00:56:50,219
with a guy probably yeah public

1232
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,739
information yeah and you can then like

1233
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:54,569
so a SIM card might be moved from one

1234
00:56:54,569 --> 00:56:57,029
device to another device so you can then

1235
00:56:57,029 --> 00:56:58,679
you can then subtract it through that

1236
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:02,119
way yeah

1237
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,250
can you print occasionally yeah yeah no

1238
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:12,100
content there's no content no you can't

1239
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,750
have obtained content from from this

1240
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,760
technique no just the just the MC

1241
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:34,320
rolling one operation

1242
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:42,340
yeah it's yeah I mean it does start to

1243
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,990
get complicated I mean the thing is is

1244
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,490
with Wi-Fi calling you're actually

1245
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,260
you're typically connecting back to the

1246
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,330
edge packet dead it gave way run by your

1247
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,160
own operator so they'll have the

1248
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,510
certificate there you'll have it on your

1249
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,280
phone so you won't have necessarily an

1250
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,630
issue or just be you could just be

1251
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,150
traveling over the Internet but with the

1252
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,640
Wi-Fi network stuff you may have an

1253
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,530
issue but there are some solutions where

1254
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,990
potentially the authentication would be

1255
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:08,040
pushed back then you then may want to do

1256
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,960
develop some acceleration techniques for

1257
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,570
localized so a caching of creds and

1258
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,670
stuff but it's it's I think it's

1259
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,410
possible but it does I mean it does make

1260
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,890
it more complicated yeah the

1261
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,670
introduction of certificates and

1262
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,950
potentially I mean most difficult you

1263
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,960
spread around the more potential release

1264
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,190
for someone to go and steal the

1265
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,600
certificates and then they can then use

1266
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,460
one of those stolen certs

1267
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,450
then kind of like spoof another sort of

1268
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,550
supposedly legit endpoint but I guess it

1269
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,560
kind of raises the bar but it but it

1270
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,180
does reveal where if the bar in terms of

1271
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,000
cost as well so it's it's a tricky game

1272
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,040
and also you it's like what

1273
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,620
CAS do you rely upon like you're

1274
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,670
probably not going to want to rely upon

1275
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,420
the entire source stack of CAS it's in

1276
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,700
most sort of OS is today you might want

1277
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,600
to have a separate operator store or

1278
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,410
possibly in some more protected storage

1279
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,810
then it's updating certs if they become

1280
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,510
compromised or all those issues then you

1281
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,000
have with certificate based security

1282
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,840
yeah okay so I think we can take the

1283
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,380
question offline everybody

1284
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,930
he cuts off now anyway in the next talk

1285
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,819
yeah we can take offline well thank you

1286
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:22,599
thanks very much

1287
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,520
[Applause]
