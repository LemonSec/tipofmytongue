1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,230
good afternoon thank you for coming

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,670
we're going to talk about narcos kind of

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,529
business cameras ever been sharing on

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,110
the right presentation you wanna hear

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,490
talk about how to visualize illegal

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,380
markets using passive DNS and

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,640
partnership with from Farsight and

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
Stefan and from rival angel my

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
background right now CRO our site

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,689
security we do passive dns real-time

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,990
data analysis I've been doing prodigy

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,330
cyber security since about 2003 before

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,149
then I have nicknames as I won't quite

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,180
tie for law enforcement here and before

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,950
that I was wearing the original form of

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,620
Tor project members in 2003 and then

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,690
State Department are at me in 2009 to

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,719
grow tour and also at the side effect of

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,610
keeping all those employed I see

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,020
criminals using tor Eveleigh john hi i'm

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,230
dan Kildee i'm the CTO of the cyber

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,620
angel a company specializing about scale

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,710
protein scanning about the internet for

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,390
data leak detection okay so what

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,640
landscape is in fast-growing this

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,830
snapshot of breaches alone in this

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,509
Iceland reach over the past 11 years

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,460
there's actually a huge continuum

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,840
between this where I get the worse and

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,670
worse and worse

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,200
2016 continues to be the worst of all

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,420
here is the sheer number of breaches and

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,460
the sheer size in fact they don't even

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,990
fit all in the same slide because the

35
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,340
breaches get bigger and bigger and

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,409
bigger and larger and larger and more

37
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,990
and more sensitive tongue so how do you

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,530
deal with it's not the amount of data

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,189
which is what we're going to talk about

40
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,310
so this started beginning what do we do

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,860
so passive DNS or just DNS in general

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,060
I'm assuming your windows would be

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,490
nested most people think it was a solve

44
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,250
problem from you know 1990s and no one

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,320
really cares about DNS anymore unless

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
you're interested main generation

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,390
algorithms and botnet but every

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,890
transaction nearly every transaction

49
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,689
starts with the DNS lookup you go to

50
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,159
look up an IP address you want to find

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,140
Google you want to find whatever

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,530
one IP address goes bathroom for 13s as

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,050
we just saw with the Moriah botnet

54
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,560
attacks another use G knows quite well

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,450
to start working at points and look up

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,209
the IP addresses of the entire to which

57
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,300
companies and products use were used in

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,570
that attack and if you can watch the

59
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,880
initial first request you can start to

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,200
figure out who did the first request

61
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,300
where these had came from and reads them

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,020
looking up things over time traditional

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,060
news buns been done through his own file

64
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,250
analysis so you register with one of the

65
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,780
registrar's for the top-level domains

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,370
some of them give out their folds own

67
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,530
files here's every single host name and

68
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,900
domain entry in our zone file you can

69
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,209
get these about every 18 to 24 hours

70
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,940
this is fantastic

71
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,230
up until the last five or six years

72
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,880
where the criminal assists are doing

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,860
real-time analysis we've all seen spear

74
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,420
phishing campaigns come and go in less

75
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,850
than an hour target they set up the

76
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,560
website registered domain set up the

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,440
website target the incorporation get the

78
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,209
two or three clips are looking for shut

79
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,070
the whole thing down and then get a free

80
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,150
domain out of it because they use

81
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,680
Facebook we never actually had a

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,920
registered domain domain tasting that's

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,060
obviously runs into a number of

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,489
limitations and just offer those

85
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,079
including the top-level domain

86
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,180
controller topple domains which do not

87
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,310
give out those own file

88
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,900
China and Russia beat two of them but

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,310
they are brought in far enough

90
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,030
the only so what are we interested in

91
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,100
we're not interested along with domain

92
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,140
names if you register domain name a year

93
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,720
ago even two months ago generally you're

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,250
not gonna use it for crime everything

95
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,860
happens in real time within seconds so

96
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,730
you need to be able to look at

97
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,989
everything with in real time and in

98
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,989
seconds and of course then there's all

99
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,730
you may need redirection services which

100
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,380
you register and you Hydra domain buying

101
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,730
something else which redirect to

102
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,950
something else you know this also

103
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,500
includes link shorteners between all

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,030
that and the fine place to hide malware

105
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,180
which we all know so what is passive DNS

106
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,640
passive dns is not recording all your

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,190
DNS queries in recording a bow there is

108
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,269
the resolver

109
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,820
so your local ISP or your company runs

110
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,620
your DNS server all those cache misses

111
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,080
you go to look up fluffy bunny calm and

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,970
it doesn't exist locally you have to go

113
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,769
to the root server to find out the

114
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,358
dot-com recertify know where a fluffy

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,060
bunny lives that's what we catch we have

116
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,440
a network of sensors around the world as

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,300
far as IT mostly their handshakes and

118
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,340
partnerships and we can see a vast

119
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,400
amount of traffic which is just the cash

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
myth so what does this provide it

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,270
provides date the time and the source of

122
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,800
the sensor for where it came from so we

123
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,880
know what part of the world that came

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
from it does not provide personal

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,479
information we do not have your IP

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,430
address we do not have anything related

127
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,240
to your local machine than the query we

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,139
also do see creepy things people put in

129
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,139
gns packets are people carry numbers

130
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,880
credit card numbers host names street

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,580
addresses birthdays everything imagined

132
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,770
goes inside a DNS packet and we strip

133
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,300
all that out of our site because we

134
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,770
don't want to be a lawsuit target for

135
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,020
the entire world I have enough of that

136
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,250
adore what does this mean we have a

137
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,370
historical archive for about 2010 of 13

138
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,750
billion domain names and host names

139
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,789
every change has happened on the

140
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:17,200
internet we have in the database you

141
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,740
back design and look through what's been

142
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,330
going on and what your domain or IP has

143
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,550
been used for all this happens in real

144
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,080
time it's about a couple gigabits a

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,300
second and we break it down into

146
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,979
separate pairs - so you can understand

147
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,630
it not everyone can handle gigabits of

148
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,060
DNS per second so is it useful for

149
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,650
research associations auditing your

150
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,020
partners plug in an IP range let's leave

151
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,250
it every two million that currently

152
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,320
points out it or has pointed at it and

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,039
vice-versa

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,570
you know plug in domain name with every

155
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,669
IP address your point at this becomes

156
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,470
more interesting we start looking at DNS

157
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,570
errors and X domain when someone writes

158
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,580
a crap we bought that and it starts

159
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,620
doing jinenji malloc that GGA look up

160
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,050
before the GG is actually registered and

161
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,729
then with five lines will be put

162
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,470
together this you know sense of research

163
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,570
and expose a bunch of counterfeit and

164
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,199
scammers

165
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,440
titoo looking at passive dns and looking

166
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,199
at network science never science is the

167
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,169
analysis of complex networks that's used

168
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,500
in biological social and computer

169
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,940
networks to look at

170
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,520
associations using different statistics

171
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,310
graph theory in a number of our last

172
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,220
term's so important to explain how you

173
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,110
know in our science associations fine

174
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,380
ties and commonalities between large

175
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,740
amounts of entities thank you injury so

176
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,970
I will now present the research we did

177
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,490
that to identify counterfeiters and

178
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,270
resellers of illegal goods in forsyth

179
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,080
pensive DNS data stream and how to put

180
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,830
them human readable visualization in

181
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,950
order to optimize the takedown efforts

182
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,310
I will first go through the methodology

183
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,400
how we process the data how we refine it

184
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,630
and how we cluster it and put it in a

185
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,570
nice-looking visualization that is human

186
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,640
friendly and after that we will go

187
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,030
through a use case first a quick word

188
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,450
about our software architecture I wanted

189
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,550
to mention that we did everything with

190
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,790
just this awesome piece of open source

191
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,020
software which is ready if suppose

192
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,210
originally was just the key value store

193
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,840
but you can do much more than that and

194
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,760
instead of going with a heavy heart of

195
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,460
stack which is ready and did everything

196
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,830
with it for Moochie process

197
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,140
communication as a custom-made message

198
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,840
broker for load balancing and for

199
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,810
monitoring agents and statistics in real

200
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,990
time so it's pretty much a magical Swiss

201
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,960
Army knife so Andrew already explained

202
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,360
what is a DNS here you have a country

203
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,130
the example is a data stream

204
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,550
made of records more adjacent records

205
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,210
that look like this first we subscribe

206
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,960
to your fastest active DNS stream where

207
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,680
we see five thousand of the rebels

208
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,650
per second the observables are called

209
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,289
resource records set

210
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,529
you exactly like this so it's a record

211
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,110
without reducing values and some are

212
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,250
more interesting than the others

213
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,589
especially the RNA which is the domain

214
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,199
name basically and also the all data

215
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:52,230
which is a I P address so here you have

216
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,319
for example the two different IP

217
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,060
addresses that are bound to the same

218
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,880
domain cyber angel calm but at two

219
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,319
different times so we get it's really in

220
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:10,350
real time I'll be the DNS queries so

221
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,079
what we will do is we subscribe to four

222
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,709
types passive DNS and we filter it first

223
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,810
using keywords what kind of keywords

224
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,079
because we are targeting kind of feeders

225
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,430
and resetted of in eco truth we will

226
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,399
first look for brand specific keywords

227
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,029
so sorry the just one picture missing

228
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,519
but if we are looking for narcotics I

229
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,459
will look for a keyword viagra for

230
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,420
scientist if I'm looking for this kind

231
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,199
of city good I will for Rolex Chanel jaw

232
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:50,670
or the obvious ones but if I put most

233
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,149
myself in the shoes of a buyer what

234
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,519
would I do first I'll just pop out

235
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,790
Google and do this kind of queries and

236
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,800
you can see that there are some market

237
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,740
places that sell replicant use calculus

238
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,230
but you must advertise clearly the brand

239
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,130
because they meant so it's also very

240
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,250
relevant to use to look for generic

241
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,170
keywords here there would be cheap

242
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,500
replica handbags watches so now I have

243
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,630
these two different set of keywords I'm

244
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,720
looking for in the Pasadena strips the

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,389
generic keywords and the brand specific

246
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:37,949
keywords for every single record that I

247
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:40,350
see through the passive DNS chain I will

248
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,439
do a cured matching I will do two kinds

249
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:43,900
of much

250
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,290
I will first do a perfect matching which

251
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,320
is pretty easy the I loop for the exact

252
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,839
strain cycle angel in the domain name

253
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,260
and I also do further match is also

254
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,330
called approximate matching so I look

255
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,480
for variations of the domain name and

256
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,070
this is much trickier because it's a

257
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,890
much more time-consuming algorithm

258
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,770
especially because we see 5000 domain

259
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,660
names per second it means we have only

260
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,810
two hundred microseconds to do the

261
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,420
keyword matching and to do fuzzy

262
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,570
matching with a thousand of keywords as

263
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,200
this pace is a huge challenge that's the

264
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,550
first challenge we have to replace and

265
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,570
to overcome it

266
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,779
we found nicely objects it's a DNS twist

267
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,760
great open-source project you can find

268
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,670
it on github if you don't know it

269
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,150
already it's you give it a domain name

270
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,089
like a psycho intercom and it computes

271
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,670
all the variations that are commonly

272
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,950
used by the bad guys to drive traffic to

273
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,390
their version of your website so we pre

274
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,570
compute all the variations using DNS

275
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,660
with and we look for perfect matches of

276
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,300
in violation so to overcome it for

277
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,779
challenge

278
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,110
what we did is change the problem of the

279
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,260
fuzzy machine into a larger problem of

280
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,709
perfect matching as it works so we don't

281
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,610
all is cured in the feed and we managed

282
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,860
to filter it down by 99% so on the use

283
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,820
case we will study later we set aside 50

284
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,560
domain names per second and it's a 50

285
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,360
websites that needs further

286
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,570
investigation so on these 50 websites

287
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,230
per second we launch specific crawlers

288
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,200
homemade colors for an in-depth analysis

289
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,660
what they will do is obviously first

290
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,400
they go to the website and they try to

291
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,830
play

292
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,950
to fetch the home page in the home page

293
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,950
we look for the brand specific keywords

294
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,980
because I told you there are some

295
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,720
websites that do not advertise brands in

296
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,500
the India domain name so here I just

297
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,300
want to make sure they do sell the goods

298
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,510
I'm looking for if they have these brand

299
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,060
specific keywords in the body of the

300
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,320
page then I will go through a heavier

301
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,000
stage but probably the most important

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
one which is the feature extraction I

303
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,920
will try to collect as much information

304
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,890
as possible that allows me to

305
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,560
automatically identify the website what

306
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,700
we call features here

307
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,610
it's who is look up we also do

308
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,850
geolocation of the IP we look for

309
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,670
everything that can identify the website

310
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,770
so all the email addresses we can find

311
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,620
either in the Whois record or in the

312
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,750
body of the page or we also follow the

313
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,740
links to go to sub pages we also look

314
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,750
for phone numbers in the body of the

315
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,180
page in there is record everywhere we

316
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,170
also look for analytics IDs like Google

317
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,250
Analytics this is very useful it and

318
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,740
it's because you know the counterfeiters

319
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,690
they like you they are businessman and

320
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,460
they want to do business and when you do

321
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,930
business you want to do marketing and

322
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,490
when you do marketing you use the girl

323
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,040
medics and the last one which is a very

324
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,490
powerful feature is the banking ID also

325
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,940
called as a merchant ID that would be if

326
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,100
the seller is using PayPal for example

327
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,610
that would be his a PayPal ID so we

328
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,350
gather all these pictures we stored in

329
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,630
the database linked to the original

330
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,490
domain we are that is being investigated

331
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,590
and we call that the website ID code

332
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,570
here are some screenshots of the

333
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,570
features we extract at the very top you

334
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,490
have a analytics ID is the ad this

335
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,430
button on the left you can see some

336
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,620
phone numbers some emails that we found

337
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,470
in the body of a web page at the top

338
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,899
bottom left

339
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,720
sorry you see a Google Analytics that is

340
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,420
present in the HTML of the page so we

341
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,970
extract it we store it as well and on

342
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,180
the right you see a Whois record where

343
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,170
we extract automatically the name phone

344
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,240
number email address etc I was talking

345
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,689
about the banking ID so for the banking

346
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,029
ID it's a little bit trickier so what we

347
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,399
do is that the crawlers detect

348
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,139
automatically that there's a payment

349
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,889
system and it grows through the payment

350
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,790
system it puts in some fake data some

351
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,309
made-up data so I do not personally know

352
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,860
not to deport man unfortunately but we

353
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,209
did buy her some very nice handbags and

354
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:00,459
we followed the process and we stopped

355
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,439
at the very end just before the payments

356
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,209
we do not go through the payment we do

357
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,579
not send money and buy illegal goods we

358
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,350
stop right before and sometimes you can

359
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,119
see depending on the platform to use

360
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,759
this banking ID that is very useful for

361
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,569
identifying the guys later here there

362
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:22,300
will be white gates a three one six so

363
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,779
we have all these websites and all these

364
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,749
features linked to the websites what we

365
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:29,529
do with them

366
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,540
I thought your the beginning the goal of

367
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,249
the research is to optimize the takedown

368
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:37,089
efforts so what we will do is we will

369
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,629
run some clustering algorithms to create

370
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,949
groups of websites why would we do that

371
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:50,889
because the old-school way of targeting

372
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,959
Connor Peters is to take down the

373
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,949
website one by one it's very costly

374
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,439
taking website requires a legal action

375
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:01,809
cost a lot of time and money and it's

376
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,970
very inefficient because counterfeiters

377
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,849
the bad guys basically are very well

378
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,849
organized they have thousands of

379
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,398
websites waiting in line and as soon as

380
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,980
you take one of them down they put

381
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,529
another one back online

382
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,319
with an hour so it's a lost battle

383
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,020
so what we want to do is a present not

384
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,599
website one by one present but we want

385
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,510
to present groups of website but how do

386
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,340
you define the group what we want to do

387
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,960
is group together the website that

388
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,970
belong to the same actor to the same

389
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,220
organization so you you can target

390
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,760
directly a whole organization and not

391
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,510
only just a website and because we have

392
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,390
a very very valuable information given

393
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,280
in the farside passive dns stream it's a

394
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
traffic estimator of the number of

395
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,210
visitors visiting the website or

396
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,490
actually doing the dns query but it's

397
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,090
correlated to the number of visitors and

398
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,140
because they are marketplaces is

399
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,630
directly correlated to the revenue they

400
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,060
make so you can target first the

401
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,580
organizations that make the most revenue

402
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,600
so how would we group these websites

403
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,800
together how do we trust the most

404
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,320
natural approach would be to say if two

405
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,980
website shares common pictures like we

406
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,390
find the same email address the same

407
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,850
phone number into counterfeiters

408
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,190
websites they probably belong to the

409
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,900
same guy we have a lot of website we

410
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,710
have a lot of features

411
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,380
it looks like a machine learning problem

412
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,380
so naturally we first tried some machine

413
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,050
learning algorithms for clustering we

414
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,810
tried k-means we'll try the here article

415
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,530
clustering but we quickly faced tough

416
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,280
problems the first one was how do you

417
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,930
define a distance how do you define a

418
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,030
distance between two phone numbers

419
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,360
between two google analytics ids that's

420
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,680
very tough and secondly the we did not

421
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,930
know in advance how many clusters we

422
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,030
were expecting and that's a big problem

423
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,900
for k-means so we looked for another

424
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,660
reputation of our data that would be a

425
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,500
more human friendly and more mashing

426
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,610
friendly because we need to run

427
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,310
algorithms on this data

428
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,180
this is how we came up with graphs graph

429
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,820
a great way to represent our data

430
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,730
because you do not need to vectorize it

431
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,930
so it's an easier job and also graphs

432
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,420
come as a very natural representation of

433
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,910
websites linked together as a network

434
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,940
and also in the end you get a very human

435
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,980
friendly representation of your data to

436
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
visualize and explore the graphs we use

437
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,800
this great open source tool Jeffie you

438
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,700
probably know it you can handle up to

439
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,130
millions of nodes and edges with it and

440
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,920
you can also add some colors to the

441
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,950
nodes and edges so you you have a better

442
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,870
visualization of your data and it's very

443
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,830
helpful if you put your data in Jeffie

444
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,060
at first you have this big black mess

445
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,730
but then you can add some color to the

446
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,760
features it gives it a little bit more

447
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,920
value and then you can run some

448
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,200
clustering algorithms we like to use

449
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,730
force at last to which is a network

450
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,910
specialization algorithm and it sets all

451
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,910
the nodes and edges apart like this and

452
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,720
it groups the nodes that look like

453
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,310
together in the end you can clearly see

454
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,340
some clusters so that how it looks like

455
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,100
after running the algorithm now we have

456
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,170
the clustering algorithm we have all the

457
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,710
First's all the domains the problem is a

458
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,010
an edge and not of some abstract concept

459
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,070
so how do we define a node and an edge

460
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,730
first the naive approach was to say okay

461
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,120
I want my data to be homogeneous so I

462
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
will say every node is just a website

463
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
plain and simple and if you websites

464
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,950
share a common feature together for

465
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,690
example the same email address or same

466
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,310
phone number I will just draw an edge

467
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,160
between the two nodes say there were

468
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,200
these two websites share more than one

469
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
feature together they also share some

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,760
analytics IDs I will just draw a thicker

471
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,740
edge so I have this concept of a

472
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,170
weighted edges

473
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,030
in the end you get some nice grass like

474
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,010
this and you can clearly see the

475
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,360
clusters thanks to the thickness of the

476
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,400
ages but there are some big problems the

477
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,920
problems are that the it's difficult to

478
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,780
see what is the relationship between two

479
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,790
knots so between two web sites do they

480
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,500
share an email or a phone number on an

481
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,030
analytics I did you just have an edge

482
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,070
you don't exactly know just by looking

483
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,520
at it what they share together and the

484
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,070
main problem was that the number of

485
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,820
edges grow in a square number of nods if

486
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,080
they share more than one features

487
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,830
together so in some times we ended up

488
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,750
with billions of edges which was too

489
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,610
much for Jaffe to handle so we looked

490
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,370
for another way to represent the data we

491
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,980
ended up with a heterogeneous way of

492
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,050
representing representing the same data

493
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,340
but so it's less natural but it's it's

494
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,420
much more suited to this problem here an

495
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,550
odd can be either a website or a feature

496
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,960
so here I see in pink the website and in

497
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,940
the other colors I can see the features

498
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,220
blue would be the banking IDs green the

499
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,700
emails etc I can see that site number

500
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,360
the website number six here I can I

501
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,910
found the emails number one in the

502
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,580
website number six but I also found the

503
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,120
banking ID number one and I also found

504
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
the banking ID number one in the website

505
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,370
ten so here you clearly see the

506
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,080
relationship between the features and

507
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,220
the websites and that's the main

508
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,200
advantage the number of edges grow

509
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,690
linearly the number of nodes

510
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,610
that's much better for running the

511
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,750
algorithms so when I use this

512
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,450
representation of data on the use case

513
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,470
we will show later

514
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,810
you get that kind of a global overview

515
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,970
where you can clearly see some clusters

516
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,900
so these are clusters represent the

517
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,380
organizations that run the thousands of

518
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,040
websites

519
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,330
setting illegal good and also because I

520
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,200
said we have a traffic estimator we can

521
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,240
target the we know which clusters to

522
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,990
target first for example here we have

523
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,240
the traffic estimations for a couple of

524
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,200
clusters and we know which ones drive

525
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,580
the most traffic so probably the most

526
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,380
revenue so I give it to my legal

527
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,710
department and I say you should take

528
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,800
down the the first the the first cluster

529
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,160
okay now let's study a use case we

530
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,270
described all the methodology christmas

531
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,130
is coming so i'm thinking about buying a

532
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:48,150
nice watch and because I like nice

533
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,430
looking watches I will we'll look for a

534
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,050
cup J watch and so what do I do

535
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,390
first I subscribe to far sites passive

536
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,050
DNS data feed I receive JSON data like

537
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,160
this all the DNS lookups and I first

538
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,380
look for the brand specific keywords

539
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,740
here that would be captive then I look

540
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,700
for generic keywords for example watches

541
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,030
and after a couple of days I set aside

542
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,900
already 50,000 pretty good candidates of

543
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,360
websites selling counterfeited versions

544
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,030
of Casio watches on all of these 50,000

545
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,420
websites I start the crawlers and for

546
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,490
example let's take this one this nice

547
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,850
little guy called perfect watches dot CM

548
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,870
by the way you can see that the

549
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,880
counterfeiters do a pretty good job at

550
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,180
replicating a legit looking website so

551
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,740
that pretty much any customer can be

552
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,940
lured into thinking it's legit so I

553
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,670
studied this guy my color will go and

554
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,400
investigate it they will look for first

555
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,170
the brand specific keywords in the body

556
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,270
of the page so there's a match for cart

557
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,760
a so I know this website does sell

558
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,800
cattle watches pretty good candidate so

559
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,730
I start the feature extraction I don't

560
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,070
know if you saw earlier but at the top

561
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,909
you have a phone number so here

562
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:16,389
my crawler sees it automatically such as

563
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,279
the phone numbers towards it next to the

564
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,029
website and also assigns I also find

565
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:25,690
Analytics ID here you can see that the

566
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,590
Analytics ID ends with B 39c we will see

567
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,960
about it later

568
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,029
so I complete all the feature extraction

569
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:38,470
and then I put all the data in Jeffy run

570
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,179
the clustering and I end up with a

571
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,669
global overview like this with 50000

572
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,369
nodes and the guy I was just showing

573
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:48,279
earlier is just lost here somewhere you

574
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,849
can already see some clusters actually

575
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,489
but if i zoom in a little bit towards my

576
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:59,169
guy I find a connected component for its

577
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,059
own let's say an independent sub graph

578
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,009
and it's clearly a single organization

579
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:09,220
is one organization administrating

580
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,539
dozens of counterfeiting websites you

581
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,220
can clearly see the organization here

582
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,369
the purple the pink dots are the

583
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:20,349
websites the other ones are the features

584
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:25,389
and so if i zoom in a little bit more we

585
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:27,789
find our guy here and you see that if I

586
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,559
was to take down perfect watches that CN

587
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:32,769
the next day the kind of hitter would

588
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:35,979
put online is what she think that CN for

589
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:39,340
example so it would be useless so what I

590
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,090
want to do is target the center here you

591
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,580
see clearly that there's a center piece

592
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,940
in the graph the red dot and what is the

593
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,909
red dot it's the analytics ID ending

594
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:55,210
with be 39 see that we saw earlier it's

595
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,519
because the the guy administrating the

596
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,830
dots on the website is using the same

597
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,340
Analytics ID for all his website so what

598
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,869
I would tell to my legal department

599
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:07,960
would be do not try to take down perfect

600
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,409
watches dot cm try to look for the guy

601
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,779
behind the analytics ID and take him

602
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:18,849
down okay so that was the use case on

603
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:23,139
the luxury watches we also try to apply

604
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,059
the same methodology to different kinds

605
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:25,900
of businesses

606
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,560
here it's about a small narcotics so I

607
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,850
will not go through the whole process

608
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,280
you got it now

609
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,930
but cannabis was a very interesting

610
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:42,910
domain because it's trickier because

611
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,060
depending on where you live selling

612
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,820
cannabis can be legal or illegal so it's

613
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,040
much more trickier to distinguish the

614
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,980
false positives and the true positive in

615
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,140
the end you still get some clusters and

616
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,780
this is why the clustering is also

617
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,890
efficient because all the legit websites

618
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,620
will be gathered into clusters so you

619
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,350
can also remove much faster all the

620
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,840
false positives and concentrate on the

621
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,740
illegal website and because I have this

622
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,790
traffic estimator I also know which

623
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,170
websites probably sell the more

624
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:25,900
marijuana on the web so about two

625
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,100
takeaways of this presentation the first

626
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,900
one you probably know already know it

627
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,850
the cutter feeding is a significant and

628
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,510
growing online threat that the current

629
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,960
solutions that are based on as anti

630
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,020
analysis and websites take down one by

631
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,130
one is a inefficient and here we showed

632
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,190
the research to use passive DNS data to

633
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,980
really optimize your takedown efforts by

634
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,470
using some Network science and feature

635
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,760
extraction applied to this kind of data

636
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,090
you can also use a similar gift research

637
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,310
for different for other problems and we

638
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,470
have also quite recently partnered up

639
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,080
with a far side on another topic but a

640
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,500
similar problem we studied the upcoming

641
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,990
US election and we we also studied the

642
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,600
the capacity of DNS data stream looking

643
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,120
for domain names that were related to

644
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,200
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and we

645
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,530
did some lexical analysis and put all

646
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,370
that in very

647
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,920
looking the visualizations you can check

648
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,090
it out on our web blogs if you're

649
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:50,770
interested thank you we have a free

650
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,660
genus TB test drive for anyone who wants

651
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,600
to go to that case-sensitive URL you're

652
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,030
welcome to sign up for the farside en

653
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,690
HTV plow through six years of history to

654
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,730
look up what you'd like to look up it's

655
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,100
good for 15 days this technique also

656
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,080
works well against the darknet markets

657
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,450
because darknet markets are still run by

658
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,840
the same criminal organizations who run

659
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,480
the clear net markets and you're able to

660
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,100
start picking out identities and IDs

661
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,110
that go over to each other and for those

662
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,790
you have caught the new Dutch police

663
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,610
just released a broad onion sight that

664
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,710
starts tagging all these usernames 18

665
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,530
across the dark 10 markets

666
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,540
tying people tying them together and

667
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,830
tying them to people any questions

668
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,559
we lost our timekeeper three two all

669
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,230
night no one has any questions I don't

670
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,530
want to say anything

671
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:57,090
sure all right I work my law enforcement

672
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,170
not directly actually we work with the

673
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,630
cooperate and they send it to the legal

674
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,610
and the their legal work with law

675
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,600
enforcement the difficulty here is that

676
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,309
the web sites can be in different

677
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,890
countries so you it worked very well

678
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,809
with our multinationals because they

679
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,850
have offices in pretty much every

680
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,620
country yes in shown to know a little

681
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,020
bit more about the story the timeline we

682
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,420
had the ID about a year ago when we

683
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,370
attended politics is talk at blackhat

684
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:38,020
USA and explaining all the amazing stuff

685
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,240
you can do with passive DNS and then a

686
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,420
customer of ours in the luxury industry

687
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,240
came to us asking if we had any solution

688
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,460
for kind of fathers in the car cleaning

689
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,130
problem

690
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,500
and we remember the policy talks and we

691
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,210
thought about Pasadena's this is how the

692
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,160
research started and started in

693
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,789
cooperation with this major luxury brand

694
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:04,970
so at the very beginning it was designed

695
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,830
for corporates and not for law

696
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:12,080
enforcement so yes we developed that

697
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,549
research incorporation with the

698
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,710
cooperate guy and then became a product

699
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,150
so we clear up our site does work with

700
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,860
law enforcement and they heavily use our

701
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,919
database to look up past activity to

702
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,690
look up we're going to 90 or who hosted

703
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,710
what on an IP over time any other

704
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:37,460
questions do we have a lot of false

705
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,150
positives it depends how good your

706
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,220
regular expressions are to look for

707
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,100
things if you're looking for something

708
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,960
that's really common like mail you'll

709
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,600
have billions of domains quickly if you

710
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,760
have something super unique like fluffy

711
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,309
bunny you're likely to have less false

712
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,340
positives and a lot of what this network

713
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,809
signs technique what you do is start

714
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:01,159
with them through that filter out and

715
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:03,230
they like we did it at the Cannabis to

716
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,610
filter out you know if these look legit

717
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,020
ahead these not on this questionnaire

718
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,259
here

719
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,580
if I heard correctly is near a customer

720
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:42,168
for the recession subsides I know I was

721
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,090
explaining like at first is starting

722
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,270
with a major luxury brand and then we

723
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,199
had the idea to apply to illegal drugs

724
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,870
first it was a cellulation viagra and

725
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,610
then we thought about marijuana

726
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,550
explicitly because it's a trickier

727
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,040
business for what I explained that some

728
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,630
worse in some places it's legal

729
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,820
someplace it is illegal but for the

730
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,390
narcotics

731
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,100
at first we targeted the pills

732
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:24,640
yes though he's work for phishing

733
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,480
websites yeah

734
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,980
that winter Network science I guess the

735
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,230
the larger answer is yes it should we

736
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,329
haven't actually done it but for fishing

737
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:41,530
websites you know you have the same

738
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,599
criminal organizations behind them you

739
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,069
should be able to find the commonalities

740
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,809
across them even though the criminals

741
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,780
may may be well coordinated and how they

742
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,309
do it they will still start using common

743
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:53,619
elements that will pick out networks

744
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,660
science as a whole as what we're using

745
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,960
here it's been used for you know looking

746
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,760
at the epidemiology of disease as well

747
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,579
as the spread of diseases the spread of

748
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,089
you know means through social networks

749
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:09,190
back in the 1930s there is a

750
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,170
psychologist who mapped out social

751
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,789
arrangements of kindergarten primary

752
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,740
school you know just kids just entering

753
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,660
school and it all works the same sorta

754
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,220
way find a common elements and look

755
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,329
through the graph theory and then

756
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,010
insurance and all that so it should work

757
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,390
fine against phishing sites actually we

758
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,829
did try against the phishing website you

759
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:31,510
need to tweak a little bit feature

760
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,099
extraction because you are not looking

761
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,890
for exactly the same features and we

762
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,359
were not ready on time for this

763
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,369
presentation but we know it does work

764
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,270
and we are actually working on that and

765
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,339
we should release a product next year we

766
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:50,460
will dedicate it to the fishy threat

767
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,760
other questions your other question okay

768
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,900
thank you thank you very much
