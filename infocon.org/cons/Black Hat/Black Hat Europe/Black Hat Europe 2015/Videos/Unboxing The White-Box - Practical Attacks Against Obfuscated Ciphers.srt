1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,830
wealth are so welcome welcome everybody
welcome to Britain journey which we open

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:13,040
is going to show you think we should you
might have not seen and who dis journey

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,560
we're going to talk about what boxes
this white box of course and we hope to

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,680
weaken which might even be there and
find keys when they are not even there

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,278
what's this gentleman and he introduced
ourselves Microsoft then there is a new

6
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,960
approach to handle we are here to
present some results and we have done

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,309
and we would like to share ideas would
have not been possible without our

8
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:50,169
colleagues at risk because of big things
but before diving into the presentation

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,460
let's understand the water and why so
what are we going to talk about and why

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,410
we're here we're going to talk about
what books cryptography

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,399
can actually only in how many of you
have heard or knows about it

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,689
you please raise your hands while I'm
impressed I'm impressed because my

13
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,330
previous tests before I actually mean
the the ratio was about 12 tents or I

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,509
think that the audience quite well
educated this means that I hope all the

15
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,330
messages you go through

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,000
well as you know most of you know
actually intended to protectees

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,439
trusted you know very hostile
environment actually happened to be the

18
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,579
most subtle wonders what you're going to
see why why it's important what is

19
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,500
becoming increasingly irrelevant

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,650
the white book scenario and the other
users or what was cryptography

21
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:49,729
what is actually protecting some of your
assets some you of your most things

22
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:57,130
including money as we're going to see
video and one aspect of your security

23
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,320
solution

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:07,550
we're going to see also both an ideal we
had with votes would be worked real hard

25
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:14,190
work tax deduction leader the North
Dublin that's maybe already known to

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:21,570
some of you to others but since the
angles that she's the intuition and get

27
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,420
different angles and different
perspective which might really change so

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,910
exciting that action and we got really
excited when I saw that actually works

29
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:44,500
and he's a very good job in extracting
keys are extremely effective approach

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,940
both in timing and knowledge required
and also we understand he's irrelevant

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,769
only for y vos cryptography be easily
israeli month 480 software bees kept a

32
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:03,860
solution to the issue of people are
going to be shy about key you mentally

33
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:13,110
or family somewhere else like what books
used to be relevant ok that's one thing

34
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,600
at a time before introduction on what
was catastrophe which I'm going to be

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,030
sent into the key to go and I know
you're going to go with you to hold this

36
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:33,269
bus to visit to get it finally did
inclusion will see what this change to

37
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,030
white box to agree to any digital
ecosystem that you're probably living in

38
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,819
the moment

39
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:48,849
ok people to be around for almost would
say four thousand years first signs of

40
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:55,328
encryption actually these back to 2000
before Christ and the problem has been

41
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,819
mostly one you know this time being sold
with any qualms or would see some sights

42
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:08,219
on the one we have two friendly party
who tries to communicate with each other

43
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:15,418
and ease an evil party which trace all
get hired public on the content which is

44
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,750
transmitted so probably a result of
confidentiality of the message and

45
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,130
netbooks Sonata which has been more than
cryptography

46
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:32,880
tucker is only able to observe an altar
just the messages have been really used

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,520
to describe things until we started
airing cryptography then the model had

48
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,560
to be amended would great books were
operation is performed this is market

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,250
and he's actually in the ice in the
system which the tacos accessed or were

50
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,949
you able to observe an altar both end of
the communication system is able to

51
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,030
observe that also would be grouped
operation in encryption or decryption

52
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:13,789
performance we are causing a great book
scenario scenario is a bit more hostile

53
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:19,870
environment to the black box because you
actually trying to have a successful and

54
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,599
secure communication even a situation
where the attacker is access to the

55
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,090
scene DUI's where did you actually use
for inclusion in the kitchen

56
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,880
well this is what is being done up to
now but something has changed in the

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,969
last fifteen years I would say what a
number of reasons we had hinted that we

58
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:49,620
have to buy land portable urs of course
and we also know the route we are

59
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,910
digital economy basically no you can
access some goods which are you can copy

60
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:11,200
it infinitely more than does not work in
this early on and that's what we need to

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,840
do what you are going to get nowadays I
don't be so now the more than shifted

62
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,530
from the confidence in me to pro studio
decision so when you actually buy

63
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,710
something you up to me by the addition
to use it and everybody is going to be

64
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,020
really happy and enjoying this moment
but this goes along also with your

65
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,469
payment course well actually nowadays we
pay with all mobile phones so it's easy

66
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:47,460
to understand that that could all in all
this solution plays a very big wrong and

67
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,229
what happens

68
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:54,860
ish actually tucker who is the other
party which is actually do a real shift

69
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,030
which has been there for nearly 10 years
15 years

70
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:09,340
tucker which in principle with free
access to all of this and also this is a

71
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,260
problem this problem is that I would
offend you kind of home at Tucker which

72
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,560
is actually the one consuming the woods

73
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,630
ebooks and audio books and I you
actually there is a process of course of

74
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:31,909
encryption decryption and actually
attackers are so the question is how can

75
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:38,130
you make the user consumer news what yes
vote without defending defending from

76
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:50,820
cities where you can actually the other
party can be in a smaller you're still

77
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:57,570
to the attacker is full control on one
end of the communication the only device

78
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,510
so you are able to completely inspected
the people graphic primitives its

79
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,380
internal and whatever how do you hide he
because this whole point of this

80
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:17,979
industry in 2002 a white box below those
be showed showed how to translate to das

81
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:23,789
and yes that's about it for example into
a white box implementation weapons

82
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:29,080
implementation actually allows to merge
it into the computer algorithm so that

83
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:36,539
the EP by making use of cookies actually
completely emerged within the tables we

84
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,208
do not get peoples of the algorithm is a
very simplistic explanation we are not

85
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:47,209
going to much deeper than this whole
idea is that doable for an Xbox with you

86
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,699
now and then decrypt while you actually
qualify lookup tables in order to take

87
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,480
into account the effect of the key such
as the execution will do you encourage

88
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,290
individual would get specific key
without saving the city

89
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,279
distinction between the keys to a club
in codon implementation

90
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,430
muscle power to be all sorts of
implementation works in the white box

91
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,079
more though we see a doctor who all of
these that is usually the business logic

92
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:30,699
of the application reason a UN exchange
and torn between its access to all of

93
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:37,628
this is able to eavesdrop holding
initial order brittle or the key and

94
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:42,879
you'll also be able to modify it will be
business logic complete access to send

95
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,480
any expedition will give you access to
the code which is running you actually

96
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,850
modify that I was possible to protect
against a very hostile environment but

97
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,019
nowadays there is two layers of
protection one is merging the two of

98
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,889
them into the web scripts such as he's
eaten within the group of course you

99
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:08,720
also like to make these vehicles for
tucker to evaluate the script or even

100
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,749
access that so the more additional layer
of protection while the first one the

101
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:21,360
actual prosecution of course so the
prosecution of the binary and also these

102
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,300
deal prescription and even be conducting
complexities can be really really

103
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,579
difficult to remove if possible at all
within the given time that you have been

104
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:36,729
hearin or it may be very easy just to
give us sometimes only when needed

105
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,790
well you're intelligent numbers were
talking about the protection of lentil

106
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,099
burgers for the usual the budget so that
you are able to step your application

107
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,120
understand is slow ones being executed
and issue a trade to its April your oaks

108
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,189
and modify your application that old
solely as a train to prevent these and

109
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,019
finally did your spine is very important
because even if you're not able to find

110
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,040
the keys into an application you can
always take the application her under

111
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,050
your eyes on to another one like that
you've a copy that you don't you don't

112
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:16,139
know the deal execution saudis device
binding is very important in order to

113
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,040
make sure that the solution only happens
on the temple

114
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,889
and he's not into the woodwork was
creeping up telling you that debt

115
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:29,160
collection usually there is one before
was only on the web

116
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,410
people but they are not going to discuss
at length of the rest proposal on this

117
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,100
part but we all the consideration and we
also made with disrespect but is what

118
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:50,050
we're going to see probably probably
predicted this is work well because you

119
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:57,479
see that is actually function of an
input and happy and then you get a plain

120
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,360
text of course

121
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,829
well basically these are people who
surround sore new principal every

122
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,709
function which I mentioned we mean any
input and output can actually be

123
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:15,500
completely replaced by another table
look-up table where we actually looked

124
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,060
beyond the ink need except the input
that is the actual value of the

125
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,709
opportunity understand how complex is a
function you can always let a 2012

126
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,089
financial

127
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:33,019
over text you are ever in a column in
there is a deal put in just a moment we

128
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,600
are completely aware it is completely
unfeasible to do for the mapping of

129
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:45,639
important work to power in 128 bit of a
yes we'd actually good luck million such

130
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,279
a table in time and in space

131
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,760
what's the reason one point which is
important first Dickey's only use in

132
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,079
some specific pointing towards me see
you need to actually be on the table for

133
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,969
the full of it but only you about some
of the key issues so if you actually

134
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,910
managed within the hour but then you
just disappears also easily or

135
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,260
somebody's actually influenced one part
of the intermediate data so this means

136
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,180
that this tables can be smaller so
that's why I was creeped or

137
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,670
implementation of diesel buttons doesn't
look like for all of lookups across new

138
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:31,729
client tables in mind that this tables
taking Brooke County effect of the

139
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,970
specificity so this means that these
tables will be different for each piece

140
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:47,920
and you will not know which key and
would see why the first thinks he's a

141
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:56,149
sports thing as a solid D specific SBUX
of the order of the night what about you

142
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:02,089
just an example showers possible but in
this case like that they will

143
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:11,079
implementing actually going by
substituting replacing dees we are

144
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:19,380
probably doing so the result of this
operation you want the people here so we

145
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,910
could replace hear this but this one
where would you run to T you have the

146
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:32,360
same output as you did you want to ask
you just replace that with one let

147
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:40,730
mechanism which we have just seen of
course is not enough and the reason why

148
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:46,250
because the SBUX then we just talked
before it is actually known to everybody

149
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,519
is public

150
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,220
public's so you should be able to expect
the modified table and compare that with

151
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,100
the texts which are outside in the
public part then you are able to

152
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,760
understand which is so easily by
analyzing the table you'll want to get

153
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,959
the key out so that's why you are going
to make something else which is run them

154
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:18,250
you take action and to take the courts
and in court all together so this means

155
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,220
that did because he's run to the Final
your kind of team prime will be

156
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,300
different and will depend from the EU is
implemented on the musician today you ok

157
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,529
this mind we've seen a tu not able to
get the key out anymore so basically

158
00:15:34,529 --> 00:16:10,760
we're going to see something which is
something that it's just the chain of be

159
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:22,779
grouped up and doing ok let's continue
in this case it's possible so to do

160
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,860
something else so the important rights
completely and change it in this case

161
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,610
and USB output completely enchanted what
is changing all and also only the

162
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,020
internal representations call that
internal encoding but in principle as

163
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,000
possible and other things they do other
number later be coding and decoding over

164
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,690
here and that's descending process
starts the respected and coding part so

165
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,829
this means that the imports already
would be created in court it and you

166
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:55,239
have no control invisible on these
imports or do regional what is just a

167
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:02,459
scorer in this case and also what is
called excellent it would provide an

168
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,970
additional layer of protection against
up here but the problem is that this is

169
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,220
not really easy to implement there are
so many took place in the system so many

170
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,120
different interaction with eastern part
is all destructive to understand this

171
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,760
encoding in order to the store so it is
possible but it's not really practical

172
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,200
and easy to implement so it was his wish
I were mostly the internal encoding is

173
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,350
present and we want to discuss just
before the end of exon encoding

174
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,918
that we are going to discuss out of all
went well the first one day we are going

175
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,090
to discuss is 14 Jackson

176
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,510
going to anybody data in order to get to
be out there don't want to discuss his

177
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:56,530
fault injection based on the process
manipulation and the other one which

178
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:03,799
we're going to show is how my boss
implementation this normal condition

179
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:18,870
will give you those on the exception
that I feel some channel here the

180
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:25,418
assumption that 2012 transformation
which implementing what was people known

181
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:28,990
and well actually there's also an issue
which is even there when you have a

182
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,610
justice minor blow but we should not
able to understand just should not be no

183
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,320
choice means that there are tax only if
you know what you are confronting with

184
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,510
what what what is what is implemented
and very easy to show it is possible is

185
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:51,640
very good condition is in there in the
blog which is difficult to analyze what

186
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,980
you like we thought we don't know much
about these I and BglII current state

187
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,190
not many public documented by general
for injection attacks or producer

188
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,360
published recently as we have paper like
that and the others call this

189
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,289
differential initializes but we're going
to know more about the attacks and

190
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:24,890
lawyers going to continue and in the
back right so now we know a bit about

191
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:33,420
what we know what did these so it's
about not getting a break when the key

192
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:44,890
we're going to movie so the other one so
I'll start with injection attacks said

193
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:51,010
he's about modifying the execution such
that the results are not the ones that

194
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,320
were expected so it's not going to
compute the right ciphertext but we're

195
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,310
going to see how we can use that so talk
about the financial analysis attacks

196
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:11,040
injected faults so from correct and
incorrect output of the crypto black

197
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,110
plaintiffs chance I doesn't matter it's
the output you can we analyse you can

198
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,020
get the key back so basically I will do
a few rounds of the crypto I will inject

199
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,620
faults I will I will over it now will
get the peace so I'm gonna tell you how

200
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,419
do we do that but yes I'll explain step
by step how that works for this but the

201
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,820
series these works for test these works
for a yes they are

202
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,360
attacks and someone who might have never
heard of these was first introduced in

203
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,490
1996 so that's many years ago and is
usually done on my word so we could you

204
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,210
just use lasers or bleaching attacks
with that kind of attacks that you might

205
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,930
have heard about and try to get the keys
out so we'll see how we can do that

206
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:10,220
script so well let's move on to a bit of
desu what you see here in this screen is

207
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:19,380
the last couple rounds of a disciple so
first you have the right on let

208
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:32,370
goes into an together with a key so
these measures would be on the path now

209
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,810
that swamped and we repeat over and over
again so we do that for this sixteen

210
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:44,600
times I need so we just look at these
and write an equation out of it then

211
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,500
this part

212
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,940
where we don't know anything about it he
obviously otherwise and we don't know DS

213
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,220
one because it comes from the previous
proceeded depends on the key as well so

214
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,550
what happens if I now injected in there
and make the output different only from

215
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,970
that back so what came here was the same
but these will be changed and these will

216
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:17,130
be changed but what we get is another
question in different herbs but still we

217
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:23,770
have the same to announce the key and
the left half from before now we can and

218
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,110
we get anyone in the key so hopefully
with a little bit of mats in the

219
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,590
computation we should be able to solve
that equation and get the key right said

220
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:39,480
it would give me the wrong key the last
northern funky and put them together to

221
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:48,110
get the pool key only eight beats me see
from the ground so how do we solve this

222
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:54,620
once the deeper we go into this is how
it looks like you have the key on one

223
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,840
side and you have to date on the other
side the data drives through some

224
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,540
expansion function we just got a couple
bites and obligates them and then exited

225
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:14,010
with the key and NBC which are 48 beats
gets booed in 286 beat into it so that

226
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,390
means that actually we have independent
so peace to the keys are used which is

227
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:28,490
easy to root we just have to run through
all of them and we see which ones give

228
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:34,920
me a solution he did give me a solution
then the key is they don't give me a

229
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,980
solution then that key is invalid

230
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,740
now because there are six bits four bits
out there have to be some losses here so

231
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,810
what we get is not one key that is a
solution we get two or three keys to

232
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:54,629
this lawsuit part of the now if we do it
again with a different fault slightly

233
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,900
different

234
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,130
we will get different inputs are wounded
different subset again two or three and

235
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:07,340
hopefully the overlap of those two sets
should give one otherwise we do it again

236
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:17,149
and then we get one key at some point we
get one key now I get 48 so I had around

237
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:24,400
so I can compute my words to the output
of the ground and applied at fault in

238
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:39,310
the previous attack and then I can get
more or less so we inject faults and we

239
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,990
compare them we break them in small
group forces with a divide-and-conquer

240
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:51,950
approach so those equations and if we do
not we should have the right so we as I

241
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,110
said before we use latest like this one
is there and then some lasers coming in

242
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,840
we don't want my car door on hardware
and how to report these

243
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:09,439
case well if you were listening the
beginning his seat software right so we

244
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:21,210
can just you know what's at any place
with anything so we do it then we we

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:29,650
collect with defaults and collect enough
inside the key and for that we can use a

246
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:36,800
multitude of options we can use terms
like you anymore unicorn we can use

247
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,850
dynamic binary instrumentation that
everybody is used to use on a daily

248
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,480
basis and we can use that to automate
this process of injectables

249
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:57,929
and then finally we need to do is open
houses which is what I just explain that

250
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:09,160
later on if you come by for example so
you can go to ASU and you'll see some

251
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:25,799
examples their school WBU this these
idiots a plane and it has a key hidden

252
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,129
within its not like a binary byte array
but it's there in the lookup tables the

253
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:46,460
keys their preference but he gets up so
the challenge was hosted by 2012 so

254
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:55,100
we're going to use it for all the
attacks that we do today so I can run

255
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:17,870
and you can see that it says well so I'm
gonna use and then I tell you it's not

256
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:25,370
in there in there but we're going to see
how we can expect the key so I'm gonna

257
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:34,260
run which is cold and while

258
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:55,590
I said before was this blog here is a
plot to the stack memory read you have

259
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:03,370
the rights and you have some basic
memories read or write did we see you

260
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:10,790
1230 applauded here in the right clothes
now when you see there was a wide books

261
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:20,020
some nice butt in here so these if you
count 50 lines here and that's actually

262
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,500
almost drowned in the deaths of these
very likely to be the death execution so

263
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,300
we want to be towards the end so that's
going to be our target area and I'm

264
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:37,649
gonna use the IDs as references about
40,000 and I want to inject faults so

265
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,560
what I'm gonna do is gonna make you some
additional program that just select a

266
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,500
random target in that group we know from
40,000 to 50,000 and then when they had

267
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,570
a direct happens in that we know that we
will just change it and I will inject

268
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:04,000
so looks like this with unicorn it's
basically well if the event which is

269
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,460
here is closed the night and we want to
because we can once every one of the

270
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:21,600
people then I just that has been short
with the random variable is just like

271
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,510
there was this is going to be read by
the program something to just leave a

272
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:31,920
meeting there so that's what it was

273
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:52,050
it was just at 1040 6400 times now open
and I will open my created I created a

274
00:29:52,050 --> 00:30:01,070
test which is here so you can see down
here in a moment and then you sort of

275
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:11,460
see which I said 20 and is the output
this is the first execution when I

276
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,570
didn't fall i wanted as a reference and
then everything that comes after has

277
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:39,460
forms so I hear from the crippled place
I run the death or both of them so nice

278
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:49,440
and which is the key on the screen or
what is important here is that you see

279
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,610
between the top candidate and the next
one so if that difference is that means

280
00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:00,679
that this solution many times compared
to the next 10 to 50 percent of the time

281
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:08,780
of the first one so that means the
confidence that the result is correct so

282
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:18,580
I had our show you

283
00:31:18,580 --> 00:32:37,350
project so these are there to challenges
they are also get the same numbers so we

284
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,459
could break almost every child that was
there and the difference was that this

285
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:47,830
latest one is actually called it has
external coatings which is what that

286
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,500
means that the output is not the real
output of the day it's just random iced

287
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,580
with so many holding that I don't know
how to describe them as I cannot solve

288
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:03,100
equations with it because I don't know
anything about the route would this kind

289
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:09,740
of attack but we'll see now we know
where we are

290
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:23,700
there myself so so what does it mean
that you can test the hypothesis you can

291
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,559
predict something in the cipher you
don't think the improved you take

292
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,770
something in deciphered that you try to
predict say you say let's say two key is

293
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:37,070
one what would give my input data

294
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:42,620
internal data then if I'm wrong and he's
not one then I won't say anything in my

295
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,340
subscription because the fact is not
there but if I'm right and I have the

296
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,120
right key I predict the right internal
value can I get the pic again because

297
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,820
apparently to power still leaks i mean
that's a position of power as to leak

298
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,990
something about the internal state still
going to keep from the one or not being

299
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:09,590
one is still a huge base of key 2222
guess so I would like to reduce my

300
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:18,679
guesses on hold the Cyprus internally
and to break even pieces so again we

301
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,080
have to fact that we have six bit of key
that independently courses in effect in

302
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:30,918
the cyber so if I can just get us 264
keys I can make 64 predictions 264

303
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,918
obstructions and if I only got one pic
where I take the highest peak

304
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:42,429
I have this independent search I repeat
that eight times and I break the hopi

305
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:48,800
and that's the concept that say in
support of doing a differential power

306
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:58,040
analysis or site are not attack going
back so generalization we take

307
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,670
measurements began in we're talking now
also on software so we have to redefine

308
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:09,920
what a measurement this predictions
could be and what the effects are on the

309
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,610
day today we generated and then we use
statistics or methods to

310
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:23,740
choose which one is what shows that that
impact and what we just discussed was

311
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,350
difference of means yes to take the
means you should check them you could

312
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:31,720
also use correlation or other more
sophisticated analysis techniques that

313
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,799
have been developed over the years to
make such attacks more effective for

314
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,700
more

315
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:44,830
of course you do this role to piece
together then you have to find a key now

316
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,009
what happens if you do this on a
software implementation of a yes that is

317
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:55,830
not skated well then this is a trivial
exercise why because the measurement to

318
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,870
observe exactly to tell you that you're
predicting so it will be a hundred

319
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:07,580
percent match the thing that the white
box she does is sit right into my sis

320
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,009
all this internal states by these random
encoding so in between that should

321
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,900
really make everything run a man when I
make a prediction gender prediction

322
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,830
should be completely defeated by the
fact that it is running them that is

323
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:27,930
what the white box you protect against
so to our surprise too much that's a

324
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,890
alluded to the fact that this works I
was looking for a picture that shows

325
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:40,819
that's a that's a price on our own
corporate website where we have this

326
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,800
personal people who work there and I
have my own there apparently just this

327
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,720
feeling is something we up more often in
the office but it is the feeling you get

328
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,259
when you do this it really works it
works out of the box out of the white

329
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,690
box so again this is principal this
technique so how does it work in

330
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,340
practice again we have to measure were
used to measure our but said

331
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,140
intermediate values of crypto algorithms
you execute the white box multiple times

332
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,870
and you have to change their imports you
could also observe inputs that are part

333
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:25,910
of the normal execution as long as they
are random enough

334
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:41,230
also on the internet you can find open
SCA or chip whisper projects yet also

335
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:49,150
deal in the same type of attack that
would be relevant to this that maybe say

336
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,920
something about the the techniques that
you need to to get the values out we

337
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,500
have used a whole range of these
techniques you can do instrumentation in

338
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,789
this print all of the well-known tool to
get for every instruction execution of

339
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:10,390
Colbeck you can lock your date are you
can look that addresses that are used we

340
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:16,400
have used GB with scripting to just get
a break point capture to stack in

341
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,380
writing to disk refused to emulate
respond to court and execution and then

342
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,589
changing values replay changing values
replay so there are various techniques

343
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:33,240
you can use and then you have to capture
that a certain form and here is a

344
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,930
difference with powered measurements we
are used to getting a bit samples are

345
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,720
also discover something like this but
now you're getting memory values and

346
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,118
they don't have high power level or
lower power level data bits and bits are

347
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,299
equal so for this type of attack you
tend to go to a bit binary choice

348
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:57,190
instead of like the school bite traces
which you can capture anything again you

349
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,940
can also capture low spots because day
reflected in texas into the tables that

350
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,390
we have no I box and they can leak
information on the final step is to

351
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:17,250
execute the analysis I will show that
sad really how did not works again in an

352
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:26,069
hour this event starts in key
implementation let me quickly go to this

353
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:27,980
again

354
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:42,609
dropping back courses challenging so we
are the same here we are part of scripts

355
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:50,990
and what is now does it does it's
breaking off a bit but the Cedar unknown

356
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:57,240
inputs going into random outputs coming
out of expertly execution running and it

357
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,089
shows the number of samples that it took
because I did he

358
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:11,200
40222 important that the date I got so
much done so I can switch to the store

359
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:20,069
you have a slightly different to import
so we have a talk by any import

360
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:27,140
there and it's so I can follow it was by
four bits as I said I will now load at

361
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:34,350
this time it's how does it look well so
it's not very recently interesting it's

362
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,359
not easy to see round one in round two

363
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,609
there are ways to get that information
from this kind of collection so if you

364
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:44,430
take more data becomes more clear even
at this analysis where two rounds are

365
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:50,750
there different ways to block this for
now it's a sufficient to just run our

366
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:57,470
so-called desktop stenosis more your
which is a bit of an overloaded but just

367
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:03,220
encrypt we are using differential
analysis we're sticking around wonders

368
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,689
in the most important things we run it
shows a bunch of output but at the end

369
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:18,570
you recognize again to keep the wrong
button so here is something you can see

370
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:25,800
here where's my point is we have some
value 0 dose our butts a correlation

371
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,790
kind of values they indicate

372
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:32,850
likelihood that this candidate is good
so we rank them and that's important

373
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,990
this difference so how big a difference
how more like this is a good candidate

374
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,939
and of course we can verify because we
think without the day tied into just do

375
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,850
the calculations but again you seem to
find the same key it's a fairly

376
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:51,930
straightforward method of analysis and
Sinopec ok now I go back to the

377
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:59,410
presentation to play again we did the
comparison with the public

378
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:07,100
challenges and were like we said earlier
there is a paper out by NXP day showed

379
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:16,150
also results and they really thats a or
we fully confirm their results

380
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,200
you see that sometimes our values are
different the middle to once you see

381
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,879
because they don't have random and
coatings so in that sense they are not

382
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,770
true

383
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,940
running my books are statewide is so
easily broken for one of many more

384
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,380
crisis but you have to realize this is
only 10 minutes more analysis time so it

385
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,400
doesn't really matter who they're also
million it's still within the real

386
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,360
motive for attack and again also
produced one around him and coatings on

387
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,110
the outside of the algorithm barrier and
it's good to remember so what does it

388
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:54,580
mean age there's no detailed knowledge
required about implementation of the

389
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,540
white box for the rest of how do they
did the tables where the rounds are you

390
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,270
depending on how you doing tracing you
don't even have to know exactly where

391
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:08,600
it's being executed as long as you have
enough memory than a bit of power on

392
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,710
your computer you can use of old is not
as much faster and take your time and

393
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,600
find it

394
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,630
the other thing is no manipulation we
hold these countermeasures off anti-bush

395
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:25,440
anti tamper make sometimes manipulation
challenging participants necessary so

396
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,220
it's a lighter lets a prerequisite Saudi
random input outlook counting on the

397
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,399
external side is is the only barrier
left

398
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,020
but like you also have to decode it
somewhere so finding the same coding is

399
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,740
not always also an obstacle so after
finding nothing coating on this place is

400
00:43:45,740 --> 00:44:01,160
good to keep in mind so we have seen
that is something we should be

401
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,670
was regional pricing for us

402
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:12,130
injection we were able by who declined
BC memory to complete a Weibull strict

403
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:20,760
implementation would supposedly in their
wall street in there but we just keep

404
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:28,890
them in the box but my best memory and
understanding the dog would bring with

405
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:37,129
you while we removed the whole concept
that we actually are injecting fooled by

406
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:50,680
the same soccer team only what has been
done for use with your bishop while we

407
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,020
don't even into money played anything
you just need to report execution

408
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:05,279
program more medially this can be done
with any trip to program you will

409
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:11,559
probably work even if the keys are
sometimes you need to go to reverse into

410
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:19,190
understanding 2017 when it is in this
case you just logged execution you

411
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:26,000
analyze you will get here of course the
problem is much more relevant it is all

412
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:34,529
white LEDs was leading younger it is as
you've seen me maybe to see beyond the

413
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:38,640
fact that after recording executive
Jimmy Johns

414
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:46,420
held in three minutes which is quite
outstanding in terms of attacks against

415
00:45:46,420 --> 00:46:01,700
the so this is why I was suddenly
breathing and movement but let's see why

416
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,558
is it really is a useless

417
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,730
really we've shown it is really affected

418
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:14,630
he's very limited knowledge of the
target required we should tax we

419
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:19,140
actually need to know the rats were
injected fault but in principle you

420
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:26,339
would just run just random knowledge and
just you and then that point would still

421
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:34,430
be nice to be able to do now is some
cases especially issue of some kind of

422
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:46,038
additional measures like use maybe need
of course you need to a price and

423
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:51,099
countermeasures to the implementation
not what we can work and also some

424
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,599
miscommunication my bills which is also
valuable sources and commercial about

425
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,140
kato of course

426
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:11,480
but we can actually show something is
not everything so going down this is not

427
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:18,450
regular social group was not something
that you just say you will see that is

428
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:23,640
more that that is in the end is more so
it's actually bought into software some

429
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:40,910
renewable your keys because it is
possible to solution while if you

430
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:51,470
actually read it but then anytime you
need to changes while this might be a

431
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:58,480
stronger well of course you need to
apply what you need to make sure that

432
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:08,310
that he's a very rudely in general so
easily interact with the ED end if

433
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:12,750
you're not able to see instrument your
program in order to record really did

434
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,990
not perform any of this attack so is
traditional program is the first things

435
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:24,950
once you actually they're really what
the outstanding defense the US stance is

436
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:35,089
in the industry know until measure is
probably not the people that are stocks

437
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:40,980
that reads but he's not there so they
are known to the industry thereby

438
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:47,710
blubber so there is hard but it is very
true nowadays with will stand one and

439
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,600
the same concept as we ordered the
attacks from that were too soft on the

440
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:58,118
same sorts are the same concept can be
ordered to softer

441
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:03,460
there are some of the nation and we
might discuss adidas of offline for

442
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:09,069
example how we had a good run them
source in pure so what this important

443
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:14,640
things we discussed but for sure that
are possible countermeasures which are

444
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:23,359
then be amended which are trained for
such unequal to prevent the disease a

445
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,499
dependence between the key and the
behavior of the problem because its new

446
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:35,240
program being the key its knowledge is
now a days were you seen easy access to

447
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:41,410
was for example depending on the ground
so we're able to do this

448
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:49,038
tried to prevent these defendants this
agency is apply randomness

449
00:49:49,039 --> 00:50:02,569
again does is still the same old while
we actually wants to rise issue actually

450
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:07,960
change in the flow and you just checked
only ones of course we are free to

451
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,339
modify no one was not notice one
approaches that you perform double check

452
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:18,049
once you check the second time and you
up to make sure those two is the subject

453
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:31,329
of course during the London along the
competition and also another thing is if

454
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:36,989
I injected fault and that holds remains
localized so he doesn't break the rest I

455
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:43,130
mean he's very easy for me watching the
isolate the BART police and everything

456
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:49,369
actually changes then the actual
announces the issue of those infamous a

457
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,780
channel partner injection

458
00:50:51,780 --> 00:51:03,050
so we are in the end we will first would
like to thank you for being with us to

459
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:43,589
come on stage for taking the questions
thank you yes please

460
00:51:43,589 --> 00:52:54,650
hardware question of whether Sri
decaying because of how to hardware as

461
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,259
executing the site for instance if I
ever owned registered at this updated

462
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,779
with the next round where you sir i have
a different kind of switching off the

463
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:08,880
transistor us that if this is press box
or something so and that matters for how

464
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:16,329
well that works in this case we are of
course still also faced with choosing

465
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:21,559
which one of these intermediate values
works best but is still not still

466
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:31,019
applies in this case we were using the
roundout boot of the first round it is

467
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:35,709
surprising that it works because of the
expected randomization and if that would

468
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,769
be full and complete that it wouldn't
work but there's probably a relationship

469
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:46,578
between how the tables are split and how
big they are over for a bit or a ditz do

470
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:49,950
you have to see this choice in how big
you make the tables right you can make

471
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:56,649
but i buy tables for all you make
smaller tables and typically there's a

472
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,460
choice about this table-size had
apparently doesn't work well enough

473
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,710
against this so probably there's a
design question about how could you

474
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:09,020
change the white box is still better be
resistant to kansas also you can see

475
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:16,369
that we are using address and this is
indeed so so there is a requirement that

476
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:21,609
normally hard work thats did some
critical component does not leak

477
00:54:21,609 --> 00:54:31,890
information i think is quite new to the
idea that the formation such as

478
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:39,700
addresses and how you access memory leak
information on the P and he's extremely

479
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:46,279
surprising also for us as we we finally
did and intuition was there instead

480
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,000
let's see if it works and it works

481
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:03,839
yes so we showed was one bright rights
and I didn't show it to anyone because

482
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:09,490
we were on the time schedule so we are
only saving the one bike rides during

483
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:15,990
the execution which is only 300 I get a
loaner we also tried it on the low by

484
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:23,129
tough to read access to address the low
budget address to reach that worked

485
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:32,069
that's a big difference could also be
back that was generated during the white

486
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:36,599
books to read or something that wasn't a
problem already done it cannot relate to

487
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:42,730
the date right in the end what you could
do also is building registers if you did

488
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:48,290
go to every registered update date
however you don't have a lot of data so

489
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:53,250
it's gonna take much more time to
analyze so we will try to identify the

490
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:58,790
data and writes like tried to one bite
size would be what leaks are leaking

491
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,660
otherwise

492
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:10,770
the morning while he's you want more we
are available

493
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:18,030
made I'm here we are at risk to go that
is available but most of all we also

494
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:21,490
have training we are starting to have
training on this story we do

495
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:29,450
proceedings really relevant and
important which you go and we will be

496
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:40,118
able to feed its website is for general
right so will be very glad to tell you

497
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:40,670
more about this
