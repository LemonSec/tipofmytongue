00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
hello everyone my name is looking at
this and I'm an independent security

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,990
researcher from Venice Italy and I've
been focusing on Apple's products and

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,670
I'm very attracted by tracking
techniques and I'm the author of several

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:21,350
new kernel CBS and exploit which is
which i've been searching on YouTube and

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:34,690
Twitter is quite big target for
generators but you also might has

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,110
started enforcing current kernel
extension signatures but you know

7
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,700
competently also introduced system
integrity protection which is a

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,489
systemwide coming for some profile
prevents access to system resources and

9
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:59,089
there are several ways to bypass this
matter is a viable way to disable it and

10
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,699
also the sandbags

11
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:12,439
starting with a brief introduction on
the kernel heap particular I will be

12
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:21,320
talking about which is later alligator
rely on solid

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:30,740
there are two functions which can create
a zone which location of the zone and

14
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:39,850
the free which location back released
and it is on has lost in first out

15
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,690
linked list containing free trunks and
locations on our team sized

16
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,950
from his own without any chance of
available and the pages and pages

17
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,240
written chunks and the chunky that the
free list

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,440
discussed very much mr Nasser so she was
detained more about it you can just read

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,550
his papers but for exploitation what we
care about is that there is nine

20
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:14,550
metadata for located chunks and there is
free stimulate our fridge thanks but has

21
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,710
been hard and since I R six

22
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,250
so these days application metadata is
the most common target

23
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,000
and I say the only one because after all
you can do pretty much everything by

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,970
corrupting application with a little
different zones use different artists

25
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,530
from memory so you can do a heap buffer
overflow

26
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,710
zone and corrupt another zone

27
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,790
but this does not apply to large
locations so you have a location which

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,079
is larger than the page size you can
pretty easily gotten Allison delegation

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:59,790
from another zone and there is color
which is like interest which reduce our

30
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,140
summer zones with two sizes

31
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,329
the only difference between color and
marla is that when you use 32 free of

32
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,750
luck goes after passing the size because
as I said there is no limit to the

33
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:24,490
trunks and so he has to pick the right
zone to free the location back on this

34
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:34,370
is that put the print color which shows
you all the zones register Michalak this

35
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,190
does not working for some reason but
just running the Print Group color

36
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,170
should work so

37
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:53,440
I don't know why there are several
targets they must come one copy which

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,829
has been introduced by Jim and american
dad there are six security presentation

39
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:08,610
back three years ago and it's just a
structure that is used to represent a

40
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,170
copy of some data and if this data is
smaller than a page McConnell the

41
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:23,510
cardinals manager bricks have targeted
the structure in the past for various

42
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,979
reasons the biggest reason why this
structure is very good is because you

43
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,039
can't control the size which is past the
kulluk when you created from user land

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,070
and so you can just put it in and he's
done to come do pretty much anything

45
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,060
with it without being affected by some
boxing but just using mark messages by

46
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:54,000
using so this is the structure in before
and as you can see there is a size there

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,690
is a pointer to the data and there is
also the color which is yours FREE the

48
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,400
structure

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,859
so she won't say you have a buffer
overflow in Kansas corrupt the size or

50
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:19,090
corrupt the data pointers to do which
are in for leaks so here's a prayer

51
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,150
carpet on Carmel exploit a loophole
which have been

52
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,599
working on and I've released in August
this year it used to be zero day at a

53
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,680
time and the core issue it was confusion
in hand remarked parts in an iPod

54
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:43,430
function and explain more about this
later but first I have to explain page 0

55
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,780
bids 0

56
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:52,049
essentially the first page in another
space on my Cobra vs essentially to used

57
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,380
to trap only pondered the references

58
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,260
those days as well I'm not sure but
we're not terribly with us as well and a

59
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,940
police forces this encouraged but not
for 32 bit minorities so if you have a

60
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,750
32 bit binary you can just skip the
pages zero and you can look at what

61
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:19,550
everyone knew all this is important
because as you will see a serviceable

62
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:26,080
extended accept various arguments and
these are converted from user on colonel

63
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,900
and essentially

64
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:36,370
mig which is an automated internet
interface generator between client and

65
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:45,190
server when you pass arguments to
function that travels big essentially

66
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,660
making itself

67
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,720
realized and unrealized this argument
see percent but in this particular

68
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,690
function you can see much but there is
not track on the task of passing and

69
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:08,660
social person tasks which is not
actually task it will pass it down as

70
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:17,590
not to the user client user guidelines
are essentially driver object which can

71
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,310
be used in userland conference in Carmel
Ind but you can call a perfunctory you

72
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:31,870
want from user and and when you create
one actually passing the task and

73
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,510
a particular user client which is this
commits one uses this task structure to

74
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:46,849
read a pointer and will do an or on the
point at which if you do the type

75
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:55,630
confusion is read from 80 and so we can
essentially corrupt memory in karma as

76
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:03,920
we wish to anything we want so first of
all we need to look at something and for

77
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:12,280
this I used him people leaked to locate
an object in color but we need to look

78
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,869
at the map copy to be able to do it

79
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,330
returning flicks and I we have to
correct the map caption

80
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:27,639
from there we can drive the Kessler
slide from their strong drop in kernel

81
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:37,029
so this is a cargo ship but it's
fragmented so allocate two objects like

82
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:43,409
the funds are there and i thought i foot
free the first run and allocated him up

83
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,950
copy in a look at a new object from
these new object

84
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,410
the pointer and we see if not I didn't
so is free the first object and allocate

85
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:02,850
a placeholder so you look at another
object leaked again this twelve books

86
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,279
are so we can just for the first time
allocated you might copy in and then we

87
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:16,630
have these men really are and you know
the pointers to us the structures so we

88
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,240
use our memory corruption primitive to
do they actually announced we do this we

89
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,550
can read past congress and have read
access to the VIP table pointer of C++

90
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:36,069
object which points to the kernel d'etat
and commentator is lead by in the chaos

91
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,680
alerts lied I'm just doing a subtraction
you can't find a solar renewable you

92
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,180
this is the result of privilege
escalation it cannot also be implemented

93
00:09:49,180 --> 00:10:00,979
in December 6 escaping way but this must
be done the structure has been trained a

94
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:09,100
lot essentially what they did was to
remove the size to create and remove the

95
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,420
curator pointer so now we just have a
structure which contains type and a

96
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,680
certain size we can't do much with this
because if you can you should change the

97
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,370
size past heap allocation boundaries you
will cause around three in the wrong

98
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:34,240
zone and it will go up to the location
and the pointer to the data has been

99
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,390
removed this prevents us from reading a
pointer to the other Santorum of copy by

100
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,529
putting them up copy one after the other
and you can't right into this pointer to

101
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:56,230
liquor rhetoric our memory for this you
need new techniques but recent data we

102
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:03,520
can just corrupt and then rewrite the
leak the data so it doesn't actually

103
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,300
look corrupted but the internal heap
state is corrupted so you have to clean

104
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,680
up later and it's also not very reliable
because it involves a delegation and

105
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,229
issue should be let out another tossed
my create another location which forced

106
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:28,399
into the place you freed the one that
will crush the current level likely but

107
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,630
we can do this since you can't read the
data point or another structure at this

108
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:42,079
you have to find another structure to be
fully and freely choose an easy target

109
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:49,630
so you can allocate up structures for
the second and corrupt the first

110
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:58,579
increase size past heap allocation
boundaries by reading the first copy out

111
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:04,099
up the memory but you also leaked the
tree trunk and Malik in the fridge thank

112
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:11,540
you can look at a new copy with the
fridge ranking and the current one crash

113
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,779
into this but you will be able to know a
pointer to the next three locations so

114
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:28,709
if you create a pointer to the second
one you have created but big issue with

115
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,079
this is that you can't do arbitrary
manner reflux you can't really say the

116
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:40,430
kernel text to fund the gadgets for
europe chain and so you can use another

117
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,520
object

118
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,540
in this case I used data which is an
object which is used by acute

119
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,990
implemented by Libby current you can use
her visa been extended to create them at

120
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:03,180
will from user and Stefan has had a very
nice talk about this scandal keep

121
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,430
armageddon it's a bit dated because he's
techniques don't work anymore but it

122
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,660
explains how did corrupts work and
that's very useful so you just have to

123
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,870
locate and remarkably structures corrupt
the first one size

124
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,730
worried about that later changed the
second structure size to 24 which is the

125
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,380
difference between the sides of the copy
and then I stated objective feedback

126
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,820
read the second game up copy out causing
our own print to the color K-forty zone

127
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:41,630
which is the zone where he lives and I
have a nice day overlapping you can read

128
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:46,550
the rat to 18 years around and they're
beatable pointer leads the Kessler slide

129
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,020
and the data points Alex appointed
arbitrator user control data so if you

130
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,260
change the data pointer and that the
capacity to a very high value so when he

131
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,750
freed estate I doesn't actually corrupt

132
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,490
you've just read you can just use I
could functions to read out there are

133
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,630
state a fairly easily

134
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:14,500
here's the memory layout of two other
sent copies and I we have some deep

135
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,660
corruption and when we freed the
corrupted structure these will happen as

136
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:27,120
you can see these two objects are
partially overlapping in memory and so

137
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,280
when you create a new copy you can't
read much but when you create another

138
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,339
copy the data off the view map couple
overlaps the second month they had a

139
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,060
second month so you can just control

140
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:49,800
the size and drink it and when you free
the second one will be in a smaller than

141
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,910
in the US so when you create another
this is what happens when you have read

142
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,459
write access to pretty much everything
you can also drive the Kessler slide

143
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,750
because it is a C++ object so you can
find out of it a one-point are very

144
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:15,720
easily ok this is something new because
for this we have to use allegations

145
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:27,210
creating a distant locations is not easy
but the best way right now and to try it

146
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:33,279
randomly turned randomly you introduce
essentially

147
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,389
probabilistic part of the exploit
because you can try to guess but very

148
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:44,370
high number of locations to run out the
free list them up in a new page which is

149
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,329
done the domestic but if you don't get
it right you can run out of the page

150
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:56,920
when do you hit over flow and that will
crush the current so you have probably

151
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,240
tickets flights but as I said that the
layout of newly mapped in pages is

152
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,459
deterministic mapping pages is expensive
but is it expensive and I stood I think

153
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:18,758
protected New Zealand and the answer is
yes you can see here this is 1024

154
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,740
which has four locations per page and
you can see that every 40 locations I

155
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:31,339
create the time it takes to create the
location socially skyrockets and I use a

156
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:38,740
heating fuel leak over there so you can
see that every time the times pipes and

157
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,649
you pay just be my pain and all
subsequent allegations are a distant

158
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:50,850
memory so yes it is expensive enough to
dictate in use around a good target to

159
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:58,339
time is a copy in which is the function
which creates a review copy structure

160
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:04,720
some general year is to create a bunch
of chemical structures

161
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,610
messages and they're worried about so I
locate a lot of chunks put them in the

162
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,750
list and I want you recreate those
allocations will be straight from the

163
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,309
free list so you don't have to allocate
any new page so if you keep an average

164
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,459
that will represent an average of the
time it takes for the free list to

165
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:33,039
return location not for new page to be
mapped in memory are so just keep those

166
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,580
allocated in and keep timing must
McMaster just once in a while you will

167
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,820
have a message which will take much more
normal to create a structure and when

168
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,309
this happens you have it's very likely
that a new page has been just met in we

169
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:57,100
already know the number of locations
which should have been added to the free

170
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,928
list are such can just keep timing just
expecting a number which is close the

171
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,820
average

172
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,200
spike is expected to happen if it
happens we have a full page of a distant

173
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,490
locations if it doesn't we have just
fail and we will try you can do this for

174
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,309
me because you know if you run out of
page you create a new page issue created

175
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,059
the same number of locations

176
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,789
the page run out so you will get a new
page you can do this over and over to

177
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:39,570
have additional reliability on your
expert you can easily crafts they play

178
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:46,520
out by poking holes in the delicate page
you can just relocate any object you

179
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,030
wish there is just one catch you have to
limit the number of locations you create

180
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,080
because she's pretty money the camera
will crash but a failure you can just

181
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,970
pull back the probabilistic approach
this month heart reliability Furyk

182
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,260
slight increase it somewhere

183
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:13,220
control is required to have any form of
reliability an example is your family's

184
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,750
CVE well this is unusual for free I
found which are they fixed in the latest

185
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,570
version of its newfound independence
through multiple parties it's a punk 19

186
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:32,270
as well as my own opponents light on
their costs and it required route to

187
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,830
kids exploit but an IRS

188
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,299
only actually needed some sixty scape
essentially the bug was a text book is

189
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,750
after free it would create a device and
I would terminate it but when it

190
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,220
terminated this device you can just keep
carrying on operations

191
00:19:52,220 --> 00:20:00,230
this will cause use after free the core
issues because I used the one function

192
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,049
in the terminal device function
essentially what they did was to use a

193
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:11,770
safe release which is not safe to list
the object instead what they wanted to

194
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:17,929
do was to use a safe released now which
is safe and which doesn't count and use

195
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:24,850
after free this was not an issue before
I might but for some reason they decided

196
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,830
to change the release code into a safe
release which doesn't do anything

197
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:39,120
particular so I'm not sure I did what
they did it but they've done it so

198
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:47,860
here's the beauty we can do use after
free object as you can see you can

199
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,840
control timestamp which is the first
argument and you can see this year

200
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,149
control register

201
00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:02,649
the second argument the second argument
that the first argument since this is

202
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:07,629
C++ it's a pointer to the object which
is freed and we have full control on the

203
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:11,299
subject so controlled the daytime
control we couldn't really get another

204
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:18,190
object and just cause of your taco to
corrupt the object itself we can do this

205
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,229
does not stand very easily by just
pointing to the table pointer in use

206
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:32,989
around jumping to user memory but newer
Macs have some new medications happens

207
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:43,249
map not many maps not many Mexicans map
many have a snap on map max max you can

208
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:47,639
just point of it Emily news around and
they were up with the Kia slurring flick

209
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:55,439
on a USB trust both smartphones map but
they are my implementation of it you

210
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,169
need to use keeping flick as well as the
clear slurring fully but there is a

211
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:09,399
technique to police after not having any
shipping for leak and this requires a

212
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:14,748
tightly controlled it play out
essentially the trick is that the object

213
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:25,039
which is freed resides in the color 256
zone and the vegetable oil index is at a

214
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:32,399
very high number so if you abuse the
free least you can do this essentially

215
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:39,799
whole the first location in a trunk of a
distant locations you control and then

216
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:46,629
you're free to use after free double
checked and when you do this memory

217
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:48,070
layout

218
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:55,070
the free chunk we look very similar to
the C++ objects memory layout because

219
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:03,879
essentially a free trunk 448 bytes are
pointer to next three trunk the first

220
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:11,970
eight bytes of C++ object pointer to the
table and as such there but pointers and

221
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,930
when you do the use after free the first
up it bites of the 43 trunk will be used

222
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:26,620
as the beatable but it points to control
minority so we can just control the

223
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,179
particular chunk of memory which will
which will be the target of a rhetorical

224
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:43,550
and as you can see the rhetorical thinks
it's accessing C++ object which has a

225
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:54,879
pointer that points to come later but in
reality this is what happens we can now

226
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,360
control instruction pointer and second
argument the first argument is a pointer

227
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,500
to the use after free delegation but
Chrysler's light is not leaked yet in

228
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,190
the prone I used a custom for which
could be considered cheating but is it's

229
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,830
allowed on SU protected a captain and
there are also alternative Tessler

230
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,178
looking strategists

231
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:27,559
you can just abuse you are the user for
free before their disabled system

232
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,668
integrity protection we can just use a
function called

233
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:38,940
yes sir settle all federal haha or six
reverser discuss this forest through

234
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,419
treacle extension and we can just read
the right redirected to dysfunction and

235
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,749
as long as the first argument is not
know it will disable super good and drop

236
00:24:49,749 --> 00:25:12,140
is not needed in the third is at all
because this has been achieved

237
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:30,860
I try to create file and it fails as a
concept but if Iran and banner will

238
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:38,760
succeed very very easily I'm actually be
early on this will explain better how

239
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:54,610
the kernel exploit its housework

240
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:10,040
ok they're free in the technique ok
showed early to sleep by using the dump

241
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:19,420
early to explain this ok so rapid growth
in userform vaccine technologies partial

242
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,750
tax has been trying to harden the kernel
sleep for a very long time and is very

243
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,440
useful for that course for to
essentially that mind they play out very

244
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:41,750
easily so I will talk about medications
for this time it because I've finished

245
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:54,900
this very very very rushed this I will
talk a bit about it from mitigations

246
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:02,809
snow does not have many of them are
trying to improve them but it hasn't

247
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:07,549
been working much course keep trying to
find new data structures to corrupt to

248
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:15,030
be passed all of their medications so
recently Apple has been changing but

249
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,549
it's not enough as I showed a better
technique for them

250
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:24,340
have been to just introduced randomness
by using skills are in size of all

251
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:33,699
objects pointed a term used for punters
I would advise to use for C++ pointers

252
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:41,040
as well as free list using different run
the numbers and yeah

253
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:49,389
SAR with no numbers for pretty much
anything related to the hip which they

254
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,990
have been trying to do I believe that in
the newest better version of they've

255
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,910
been changing the way he play out of the
free list I haven't done much research

256
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,660
on this

257
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:07,230
about it's breaking my exploits so I
believe this is what's happening but

258
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,300
it's not still not enough because they
keep leaving in object which can be used

259
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:28,730
for the same technique it's not enough
what Apple is doing right now so yeah if

260
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:39,820
you have any question about that ride I
will answer you

261
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:52,000
I've been rushing I'm pretty

262
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,390
first time speaking some not really
confident about this

263
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:05,350
yeah I'm very sorry but it won't need to
explain anything for you just ask and I

264
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:25,429
will do my best

265
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:33,250
I don't know what to do actually

266
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:44,400
ok ok

267
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,190
yeah

268
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:54,330
essentially minorities have segments
each segment describes a part of the

269
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,178
other space

270
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:03,070
must Marco Banderas have these pizza
rolls excitement which essentially moxa

271
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,090
page which you can't a map and you can't
do anything on so if the current

272
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,999
authorized to access this page if you
fail because it won't be readable it

273
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:19,269
won't be able it one big table so you
can do anything with it but essentially

274
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:24,990
what Apple did was to other tracking the
kernel to make sure that this page does

275
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:31,889
indeed exist but there are some very
very old fighters which do not have the

276
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:39,369
pages or segments and I've asked about
it they told me that its software that

277
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:46,899
is on a very important to not break
least so they cannot enforce a 20 on 32

278
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:51,029
bit biased because of compatibility
reasons potentially if you have a Mac a

279
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:57,169
binary which lacks 80 the kernel doesn't
do anything about it and you can just

280
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:02,210
much anything you want us so you can
discover the map

281
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,610
allocate to locate the page 0 and you
can write read and secretary excuse

282
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:21,659
anything you want it

283
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:33,700
up 80 used to be able to but since you
also might Apple a standout that there

284
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,220
are many current bugs involving all

285
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:43,770
I mean it's not many years ago had this
on Linux today we have the damascus ten

286
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:49,789
people are discovering 0 day which
involved in your bed and so essentially

287
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:58,100
what they did was to prevent all access
2003 map in but

288
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:05,379
on 64 bit virus just just kill your
practice if you don't have a bit 0:32

289
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,820
beat once they don't you can't just a
market you have to lock it to do

290
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:20,960
anything with the note page

291
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:31,909
essentially asked is if there are any
technical questions

292
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,840
reasons for this and my answer is No

293
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,908
there are there are not many reasons for
this Apple does not used to pay 20 at

294
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,380
all

295
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:50,010
but there is least often it breaks after
they really care about it for some

296
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,810
reason I dunno why but I mean just
blocking it would kill an entire class

297
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,540
of caramel color abilities and there are
a lot there are lots of lots of lots of

298
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:12,190
time in the current

299
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:30,700
of the minority yeah it's tricky but
Apple generally speaking is not good at

300
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,050
fixing tricky problems I believe

301
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:41,050
they've done an awful lot of mistakes
over the years for example gatekeeper is

302
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,100
a bit of a joke in my opinion because if
you have an assignment binary which

303
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,510
links to an outside the library you can
just run it and it won't complain you

304
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:57,629
can just change the library and
execution of gatekeeper and reason why

305
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:02,030
they didn't fix this is the same one I
didn't expect zero because there is

306
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,170
compatibility list and they don't want
to break it and I believe that this is a

307
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:14,990
very very bad technical security point
of view for Apple have i mean I have

308
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:20,040
been able to achieve with security
because they could break the rules but

309
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,139
they don't want to stand and its verdict
problem because many many many bugs come

310
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:35,529
from for this from the three isn't any
more questions about anything additional

311
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:42,730
ok

312
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:52,369
where can you find the code for it
essentially they discount the mock 04

313
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:58,630
when you run the executable they scan
for all the segments of memory describe

314
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,700
your executable and if there is no
segment that describes the page of Syrah

315
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,330
and there is nothing I meant for the
pizza 0 which is essentially not

316
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,069
readable writable respectable the kill
you

317
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:21,090
so this is not the other side enforced
in 32 bit but on 64 bit any modification

318
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:36,540
of the the segment which involves page 0
will get you killed

319
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:44,580
well there is something that is being
produced it prevents this from happening

320
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,220
and if system integrity protection with
it you can't actually lower than the

321
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:56,750
current extension without a signature
essentially I've made her extension

322
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,710
myself its cousin worldwide which
essentially disables all access to the

323
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:11,770
page to lock up 80 staff and sarah has
introduced in his body guard Dexter the

324
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:18,630
same kind of protection you can just
install he's such a wide guard or mine

325
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,960
regard but newer versions you have to
disable system integrity protection for

326
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:34,120
it so it's not really a good way I'm my
opinion to fix it but yeah just meet you

327
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,089
could I'm not sure Apple doesn't do
something like if system integrity

328
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:46,860
protection is enabled lot 80 I have no
idea why they don't do this but it's how

329
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:54,280
they doing it so they could very easily
it's just like one line of code change

330
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:01,600
but I'm not opposed to I don't know
they're they're thinking about it I'm

331
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:10,440
sorry but ok if you have any more
questions questions but you asked or six

332
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,400
colonel competition
