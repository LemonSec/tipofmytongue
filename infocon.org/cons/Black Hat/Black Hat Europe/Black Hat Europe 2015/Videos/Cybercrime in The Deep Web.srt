1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
so I come everybody kind of epidural yet
again at black hat to give a talk and

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,870
this time they met with a chance of a
colleague of mine we actually work

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:23,330
together and say we start walking in the
manner in which the time I was down in

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:34,660
chili contest from Argentina used or
trying to get into deeper and deeper and

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,169
show me you know you could buy
associations drives so I was pretty

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:46,930
excited about that so I said ok cool
tools 2002 collapse as much as possible

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:55,789
because we cannot be too much more than
two years of them up and told that we

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:07,659
developed to automatically call it deep
and also the content and nowadays we

9
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:13,650
bought 44 writer Michael assuage and we
both come from academia personal

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:28,750
security and the guys that are behind
and web security and yeah we produce

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,460
workin any different field of security
from web

12
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,860
last year I was back at the center which
is like a tracking system for four ships

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,049
so we are trying to basically British
senator Michael not only as a nadie

14
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:54,790
Vanderbilt more like a 360 degrees so
any securities

15
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:03,460
and introduced himself to do it and they
will be able to take from here to the

16
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:10,329
first talked and I we discussing a bit
more detainee type of malware which is

17
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:19,610
so unlike marking my background is more
on the networking I got a PHD he was

18
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,390
basically

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,000
networks and how to make them talk to
each other and so on so it was a good

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,100
fit for this kind of research after that
I joint marketing trend Micro and we

21
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,730
started working back to back home you
know these kind of projects which also

22
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,980
this research so I have a brother
stronger the vellum background which may

23
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,140
need to develop the system you know
together with him so the idea here was

24
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,519
again when we got to where that you know
there's a world out there

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,510
of resources that are stealth and hard
to track which might be ideal for bad

26
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,890
guys we decided that we wanted something
to both you know make some research on

27
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,140
top of it and sort of gives our
colleague which are more into more of an

28
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,958
island is provided they do
investigations some tools to actually

29
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:16,910
truck malicious actors around the deep
as best as we can so just to give the

30
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,549
talk of the following are just gonna
give you a quick introduction and will

31
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:26,060
be mean by deep web detail of our deep
breath analyzer so the system that we

32
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,920
developed a sort of trade the daytime
and analyze it and organize it in a way

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,489
that it's easy to

34
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:39,040
easy to navigate gonna give you some
examples of what we found in terms of

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,940
interesting resources related to illegal
trading so sort of the crazy stuff that

36
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,440
you read in the press from time to time
was here with seeing their some examples

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,250
of the candidate analyses that we can do
and how can be exploited to find again

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:02,800
our interesting actors and Marcos gonna
focus on the part so show you are

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,340
actually some malware that exploits the
deep within how and how we can track it

40
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:14,000
actually and then draw some conclusions
so first of all I'd like to try and the

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,100
crowd by being extremely pedantic being
told that that works some definition

42
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,710
first so this is very important to make
this distinction cuz if you see the

43
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,070
research research that mention the term
web probably beginning of the year 2000

44
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,000
what they refer to as deep web was in
fact content not indexed by search

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,760
engines and that's where you get to know
those paper that claims that you know

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,980
the deep web is like the submerged part
of an iceberg of which the surface with

47
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,950
is just the tip and so on of course it
is and the estimated that we have like

48
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,390
30 million terabytes of data in the deep
web and so on which makes sense if you

49
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,620
are dear 32 that definition which this
definition which includes you know your

50
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,580
home banking page or anything that has a
login page or anything that pretty much

51
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,140
has a configurable the txt file so that
the search engine doesn't exit we have

52
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,550
another definition that's the one that
interests us more which is darkness

53
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:22,230
which are actually private overlay
networks dedicated hosting ressources

54
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,160
way and deriving from that we have dark
web which is the actual world wide web

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,580
host that on top of darkness so this
distinction is important because for

56
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,310
example you got things like getting the
press or you have quotes like this so

57
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,900
this is a documentary which came out
this year from there which

58
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,039
Excellent Adventure one was can read the
second one was an extreme der so was

59
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,570
that died there and made this
documentary about the whole silkroad try

60
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,849
yelled commanding everything and if you
look at the trailer right after the talk

61
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,330
it starts with this quote the deep with
these vast thousands of times larger

62
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,849
than the surface web now said with a
very deep and scary voice and scary

63
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:15,990
music and so on which again has a
mansion yes it might actually apply if

64
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,120
you considered as you know your home
banking account then of course its vast

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,870
and there's a lot of resources there but
when you see in fact the what's actually

66
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:31,350
interesting for cybercriminals decides
might not be called the you know the

67
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,440
iceberg metaphor doesn't really apply
there so then you would that say but

68
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,210
then why do you talk about your research
with research I mean you just said the

69
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,000
distinction that is why I should eat
what we consider that interesting for

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,440
malicious actors affected not just dark
web which include a note or I could be

71
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,810
but we also try to sort the luca other
resources that might offer some interest

72
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,979
to cybercriminals because they are you
know let's regulate like in a row

73
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,150
kilby's they have a separate
infrastructure and so on so I'll just go

74
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,948
through this you know very briefly to
just give an idea of what we're talking

75
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,349
about so tour raise your hands have
never used or his life never heard about

76
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:22,289
or is there another guy ok so you know
we don't need to spend too much time on

77
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,760
this I think everyone knows that he
started as a way to do allow people to

78
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,159
do on the internet go on the internet
anonymously overcome censorship and so

79
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,990
on later the development is pretty much
the battle and services which not only

80
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,699
allowed people to actually go to say
Google or your website and firewalls and

81
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,419
so on

82
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,539
actually allowed people to host the
website in an honest way so that they

83
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,630
are untraceable you know by the customer
that users are untraceable into service

84
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,420
untraceable 2009 routing your request
jumps from hoops

85
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,520
increased that multiple times on each
hop on the path can only be creeped one

86
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,450
they are the time so you never know
exactly the complete that brief I could

87
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,750
be less known

88
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:15,930
brother at or I'd say unlike tour it
does technically allow you to go and

89
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,930
browse anonymously surface web it's
dedicated to Austin he does services

90
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,170
which are identified by those two main
thought I took you can recognize a night

91
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,610
rapida services because he has a dot I
to be top level domain for toward those

92
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,360
would be the dot on your demands in case
someone doesn't know and he has a

93
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,180
routing system slightly different we're
in order to reach someone you actually

94
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,870
have a distributed hash table someone
like NoSQL database that contains an

95
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,850
inbound

96
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,760
know that you can contact basically
reach somebody at that somebody can

97
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,350
answer back through he's out of town of
the gets routed you're in town of nice

98
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:04,680
guarantees anonymity multiple level of
encryption and 2013 net this is kind of

99
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,800
a weird 30 is the oldest one of the
three factors right to be comes from and

100
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,800
it doesn't really allow you to host a
proper website where you can actually

101
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,859
deploy an Apache stack and all that
actually helps the proper website it's

102
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,100
mostly for razors look up so you can
post a resolution free not like any

103
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,790
major static HTML page and so on

104
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,579
it gets identified by a hashed and you
can retrieve it you know by using that

105
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,300
actually so you issue a Request your
network you have a neighborhood of notes

106
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,780
you connect to issue a Request for
something they request goes from the

107
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,069
found somewhere and then you get your
response back so you can't redo dynamic

108
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,010
web but still need to host that's a
picture galleries or static files that

109
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,319
just perfect in terms of name-calling
than Mr calling so this is not really

110
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,830
estelle

111
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:03,500
website hosting its mostly away to
register domains like bypassing I can

112
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,190
regulations and so on and they're
basically so these are systems that

113
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,800
allow you to register domains using a
block change like technologies are

114
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,449
emerging from the currencies like the
car is the light gonna solve one so

115
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,290
rather than storing in the block Shane
actual currency transaction like I give

116
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,030
you tend to do that you actually reduce
their domain name information so that

117
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,569
guy you just registered this domain name
not be a team that's the top level

118
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,650
domain for Bitcoin and so again you
actually need you know specific software

119
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,880
to connect with but it allows you to
actually host domains outside of the EU

120
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,650
countries for example same thing for
this is like the oldest of all the

121
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,040
systems used to treat there was very
popular in the nineties where you know

122
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,599
you had plenty of companies that would
offer you you're on top level domains in

123
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,850
their own DNS servers and so on provided
you connected their DNS is basically and

124
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,520
some of them still survive today
actually like namespace i think is still

125
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,829
doing something open Nick decision ruled
it's pretty much a whole we r world on

126
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,430
his own

127
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,660
it's a system developed by a guy who
invented his own country religion

128
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,860
medicine degrees calendar time things
and Internet deployed probably 2013 DNS

129
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,940
servers all over the world that response
to that DNS but that's another story so

130
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,710
again with this when this in mind we
figured you know let's see exactly

131
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,000
what's out there that's collect some
information see how we can fix it in a

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,190
proper way so that it becomes usable at

133
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,720
what we find so we spend like one year
or so

134
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,250
developing over the analyzer which so
this is the view it's made of several

135
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,060
modules so first one is of course they
took election so we tried to pretty much

136
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:03,500
find URLs everywhere we can or as many
places as we can we index them in a way

137
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,110
that allows them to be searched very
smart ways and also to pull that these

138
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,530
things for example and we see how these
these things can become very useful when

139
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:19,329
you want to spot milder on those URL we
go and do what we call scouting with

140
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,150
pretty much with its pretty much page
crawling you know finding basically

141
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,209
everything about the URL if it responds
he had there is it doesn't respond why

142
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,820
do we have a problem with the resolution
is giving us an HTTP error or something

143
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:40,670
we get to page content screenshot part
of the tax for scanning some of the

144
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,099
address is to find things out there than
just a shitty be and so on and we do

145
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,140
that through our gateway so we have
basically universal gateway that allows

146
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,740
us to go everywhere in the deep web
through just one port combines all the

147
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,420
different software there with
information we got treatment namely we

148
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,800
translate the pages computer were clouds
and so on and then of course we can

149
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,199
access the information so either through
some statistics software such as cabana

150
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,630
for we store them in elasticsearch those
forged a deal companion basically to

151
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,550
Putin to pull out a nice graph strands
see exactly how much data we're

152
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,920
collecting and so on and then we develop
a custom portal which allows us to

153
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,050
actually do what we called a qualitative
analytics meaning actually go and look

154
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,890
at the data we have so with the
screenshot the date of their what are

155
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,439
the interesting links and so on so in
terms of data sources this is pretty

156
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,990
much what we are trying to guide their
we get user data analyzed user data in

157
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,520
particular so from our users we know
basically what are the HTTP connections

158
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,819
that you're doing so we don't know who
is the connection but we can see this

159
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,459
to see where is it going so we basically
parse them to find all the connections

160
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:02,649
going to on the main site repeat domains
the domains and so on

161
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,709
we scrape sides like pastebin for
example in all the similar slack see

162
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,319
pasty and so long to find you know basis
with interesting addresses there we have

163
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,469
a treat their feed so right now is the
one percent fee but we're working to

164
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,499
increase it to the full day two holes
basically and pretty much see exactly

165
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:25,509
tweets if we can find on Young's I
trippie beat maybe in the future

166
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,470
recognizing Obama traffic and so on

167
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,949
we money for some home some subreddits
like our tour are on our darkness

168
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,748
marketplaces and so on

169
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:42,589
there are also some ul listing sites
like dark Nick links I think on your

170
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,229
links dot com and so I just decided that
posts you know least in list of links

171
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:53,069
and you can get their tour gateways so
there are actually sites like tour to

172
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:59,159
Wed org or on your cab which are
dedicated to let you access resources on

173
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,199
the Tor network without having to
install the client so the disadvantage

174
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,728
there is of course if you're not
anonymous anymore cause you know that

175
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:10,509
website with C you actually connecting
and the kids that these things actually

176
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,979
all what are the most popular deep
websites accessed through them and those

177
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:24,229
36 a public so we can put them each day
and basically see there are a host files

178
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:31,249
this is something similar to the sera
verdad any tea fire that you have with

179
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:36,169
some of you were using tools to do you
know pirate stuff or something or

180
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:40,959
absolutely not so it's a file that
basically contains some text some

181
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,868
information to help resolve might repeat
domains officially night repeat domain

182
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:52,619
sees a big long hash doggie $32 that's
the actual address that is stored in the

183
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,600
system but you can actually register
some readable domains such as

184
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,860
something they get resolved to their
actual hashes and in order to resolve

185
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,079
them you can actually download this text
files that pretty much gives you this

186
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,370
look up information and of course by
downloading these fires day on a daily

187
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:18,410
basis we can see new domains are
actually and then of course we got the

188
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,209
feedback so when we scout team pages

189
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:25,109
get all the links on the system's to
collect statistics index them and so on

190
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:32,399
and so forth so this is Karen gateway
that I mentioned you know general D put

191
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,980
gate was it allows us to justice system
point just one port or if we have people

192
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,839
doing investigations or something they
want access to just go to 143 got

193
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,290
deployed they're doing what they can do
it's basically just weed depending on

194
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,680
the URL they're accessing you can
redirect them to either policemen tour

195
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,120
we got 64 instances running we got the
night to being sent there if it's like

196
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,980
to be domain we got three nights running
if we have something resembling if you

197
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,449
are out and then we have a custom DNS
resolver that pretty much resolves a

198
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,049
normal day in a stroke of these name
coins and everything so connected that

199
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:14,319
poor get everything you need makes
things so much simpler in terms of

200
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,668
scouting so as I mention this is kind of
all the data we tried to get you the

201
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:26,020
headless browser that pretty much leaves
us back a full hard logs meaning all the

202
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,110
HTTP transactions that happen in the
page where we have is attributable

203
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,490
browser window

204
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,809
connects to the address and all the
other connections that come with

205
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,418
directions or other connections there
log there so we can restore them and you

206
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:44,980
can help us for example 5 drive-by
downloads or whatnot we get the full

207
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,789
page gone after you know every executing
JavaScript and everything so we got the

208
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:56,620
final done with that we take screenshot
of the page we take the title text

209
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,939
altimeter data like all the keywords tag
meta tags ressources all sorts of stuff

210
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,620
we store for some pages there are you
gmail you can always come useful

211
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:13,639
extracted links as I mentioned we try to
parse email addresses and beacon wallet

212
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,690
this is the kind of formations this is
what you're using actually it's a nice

213
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,040
piece of this cold / which again is a
mention it offers a nice headless

214
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,450
browser that you can just a ploy on your
machine you can either act as a proxy or

215
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,490
respondents unrest request so that you
can just you know you can either browse

216
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,260
the web using that as a proxy will
eventually store screenshots or stored

217
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,340
data from there or you can use it as a
server connect with Telemaque go to this

218
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,409
page to this proxy and get everything
you can to accidentally actually

219
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,360
modified some great libraries and
created some middleware is in order to

220
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,709
access it and actually a great and also
with some shared use so that we can

221
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,500
long-term multiple processes and make
things more efficient and as I mention

222
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,960
we extracted the links and everything
the other interesting part of all this

223
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,860
software is that you can also screening
throughout and heavy to interact with

224
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,919
pages or that it supports no script
padlocks script so you know you can even

225
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,670
use it for shame browsing basically so
in terms of arrangement as a nation we

226
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,950
collect the data we do some reading
operation on top of it namely for all

227
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,730
the links that we find we go on our web
reputation system and we try to get the

228
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,670
classification of the surface with links
at least we get the classification and

229
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,790
categorization so is the link militias
is it safe

230
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:45,190
any fitment issues why is it militias is
it tour is the link to avoidance for

231
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,260
example which doesn't really make it
interesting but we got there we do

232
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,559
translation so we try to normalize all
the texts to English cuz everybody

233
00:19:53,559 --> 00:20:00,620
speaks in the team so we can get to that
point sort of make at least get an idea

234
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,030
of the page if anything seen the
furthest languages we try to language

235
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,389
detection as well of course while we do
the translation which allows us to what

236
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,130
are the most popular language is there
and we do a significant workload which

237
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,370
means that we tried to pull over cloud
out of the

238
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:24,530
text but in a more intelligent way I say
so what we do basically you know from

239
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,680
the tax credit for all the HTML of
course we create our tokens meaning word

240
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,290
so weird how many times it happened page
we feel terrible thing people need

241
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:41,129
announced so you know table chairs the
screen and so just announced their

242
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,830
getaway old verbs and adjectives and so
on

243
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,129
we denounce we compute what's called a
semantic distance matrix which means

244
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:56,230
that we use a Python library called war
which contains basically a graph of all

245
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,940
the words in the English language
connected to each other according to

246
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,410
their meanings or to their taxonomy so
for example words like dog and cat will

247
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,510
be fairly close into that trust because
they're both animals baseball and

248
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,559
basketball 30 closed because they're all
sports dog and baseball pretty far apart

249
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,480
from one another so using that drop you
can actually computing to hopes all

250
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,520
based on two words are from one another
and we use those too weak for all the

251
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,139
work that we have and we use that to
clustering so we create clusters of

252
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,150
words with similar meanings take the
first of the words in alphabetical

253
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,179
there's a label and then just use that
information to compute an actual work

254
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,880
load the tells us something more than
just pretty much objectives so here's an

255
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,460
example I scouted the Russian forum
called Russian steel looks interesting I

256
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,720
had no freaking idea with selling here
goes unfortunately I don't speak russian

257
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,290
but if I go check on the work loud at
least on the top 20 words and looks like

258
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:02,760
again registration rules for trading
raisers silkroad of course register and

259
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,070
so on so at least the Glens right away
or what a page can be about anything

260
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:14,250
it's worth looking further into or not
this is more or less

261
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,670
the collected data that we got from two
years we pretty much had like 445

262
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:26,630
million events which means each event is
when we find a URL basically so we spot

263
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,080
a URL is twenty been reported again it's
a second event in total the URLs that we

264
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:38,270
collected our life around 600 610,000
URLs for a grand total of more or less

265
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:45,430
twenty thousand domains or 20,500
dummies keep in mind though their terms

266
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,640
of these very volatile later you know
you got something like operation on

267
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,260
impulse and one day all your data
becomes craft called there's a massive

268
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,990
take down in most of the sites go down
insulted that you collected data but the

269
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,250
sights on the Barrymore so again I think
right now about the twenty thousand

270
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,750
domains we're probably around 9,000
actually online last time I checked so

271
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,880
I'm gonna show you a couple of videos
that idea of how our portal works will

272
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,260
forgive me if I don't do the connection
but it's like a double tunnel connection

273
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:24,460
and I really don't trust wireless
networks conferences so this is an

274
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,610
example of a Euro summary page that we
have in the system

275
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:33,760
36 I just show you here is a breakdown
basically we're all diary or else are

276
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,200
grouped by hostname with path

277
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,390
clicking on the plus side you see we can
get past the more we can get very

278
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:46,950
strings in green you can see sites that
contain pages that we managed to scouts

279
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:53,900
all sides with pages that responded to
our caller hello are actually pages that

280
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,820
we tried to crawl but either didn't
answer to the result the name or we got

281
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,110
there needs to be a row and those pages
are not discouraged as they can be

282
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:12,229
interesting to action while in 20 pages
in red we actually find pages that we

283
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:18,910
scouted and contain links that we rated
militias so these are pages that contain

284
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:24,110
links which written militias and this
should be interesting on there on park

285
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,979
so we can actually do certain feel so
for example here and filtering and just

286
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,690
find the IP ready to pay just got an
example of those long hashes we don't

287
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,920
need 32 I can filter in justifying the
malicious pages and what they find here

288
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,520
for example has come for you to be which
happens to be a counter these services

289
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,290
some thing like no virus told dole with
that guys where you basically paid to

290
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:53,030
submit your piece of malware and get
checked against all the engines are

291
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,460
still talk about without divulging
information so if you're developing some

292
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,530
new model where you can actually get to
check their get a check there and had

293
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,750
the information to private so again the
workload here sort of gives you the idea

294
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,980
antivirus checked least virus and so on

295
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,150
we get the page screenshot right there
and they're here the work last year so

296
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,080
the work of these made a little words in
the table below you actually see all the

297
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,280
words that got picked so again see the
kind of clusters that you get least

298
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,990
database blacklist spyware software
guard defender and so on

299
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:44,450
after that we got the things we got the
links there were present in the page

300
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,040
this is the links that made the page to
mark the page read is the execrable com

301
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,159
which happened to be again interest was
rated as Internet Security disease

302
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,679
vector and marked as dangerous that is
because that's actually a site selling

303
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,049
creep there's so software that allows
you to obfuscate your binary either

304
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:10,990
thing we got the tags resources and so
one basically another damn this come

305
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:17,490
from the page which is page where we can
do either searchers on the page content

306
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:23,809
or we can do search is on for example
the URL so we will see and this shows

307
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:27,149
you and actually look at the data itself
without caring exactly how the Urals

308
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,550
organized so in this case we are

309
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:39,120
in this case we show you actually how to
do a search on the URLs to find for

310
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,770
example open directories so there's a
particular kind of open directories are

311
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:52,340
generated by W get which presents a Euro
we 20 metres AC which means sorting

312
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,320
criteria and they hope which is the
sorting order so in our case we actually

313
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,770
story and the URLs by all the different
components which allows us to go in

314
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,690
search for those specific query
parameters and retrieve pretty much

315
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,110
everything in our database that it's
pretty much an open directory which is

316
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,520
very interesting because then you can go
and find you know if they're drop zones

317
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:21,150
if they're leaked leaks or all sorts so
here for example we open 12 screenshot

318
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,790
shows that it's a file list as we
expected the workload here doesn't mean

319
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,040
much being a work of made a file names
which will be mostly gibberish and so on

320
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,920
so back to the presentation

321
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,130
examples exactly what we found their
pages an interesting things that we got

322
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:51,610
to spot so most in one of the most
interesting guns of course this is a

323
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,270
store claiming to be in the UK you can
basically find stores everywhere pretty

324
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,990
much every part of the world

325
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,640
again I honestly have no idea how I one
point for bitcoins 4 o'clock $0.99 very

326
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,350
convenient to me the most because you
know it's a reduced their so and again

327
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,559
you wouldn't go there to buy guns
because she price you can go there

328
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,178
because you pretty much need no license
or anything

329
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:21,230
drives I don't even need to actually say
it like this is everybody sees in the

330
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,559
press and so on

331
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:29,059
from marijuana to all sorts of drugs you
can see here crystal meth coke and

332
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:32,850
everything this is like the main main
driver of the economy with no doubt

333
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,449
about that

334
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:39,910
passport and fake IDs so this side
claims that it will provide you with the

335
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,480
Dutch passport for 600 euros which is
fairly interesting they got pretty much

336
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,290
many many interesting nationalities the
us1 be the most expensive you can

337
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,610
actually get to be driving licence and I
D car that's well they even take care of

338
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,879
that the gates in case you are so clumsy
to lose your fake passport and you know

339
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:09,490
counterfeit money again here's an
example with you revealed 25 May 1504

340
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,200
because you can basically get a fair
amount of fifty euro banknotes or at

341
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,460
least that's what they claim about that
you know we can track the claiming of

342
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,440
the website then in order to go actually
in check their website is legitimate and

343
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,110
so on

344
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,379
you need to either operation by the
country you go and try to buy stuff to

345
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,550
see if it works because that's called
financing activities in most countries

346
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:40,240
so so this is you know they are they
claim to be they look like

347
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,470
back double shady business whatever that
may mean so but I haven't personally

348
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:53,990
credit cards again you can buy them in
bunch you know with maximum balance

349
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,300
course being either stolen or clone they
might not work so you get maximum

350
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,600
balances and we drove limits the higher
they are the more you pay for them this

351
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,740
is very interesting for social engineers
you can actually buy packs of PayPal

352
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,320
account

353
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:17,100
so hundred people accounts of which you
know 80% is given as working again

354
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,000
30 interesting there 403 because you
have to do against cancer and everything

355
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,899
this is what else doc seeing some very
interesting pages you know sort of

356
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:33,658
giving out personal information about
high profile figures in this case

357
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,539
there's an example with bill and hillary
clinton this is the actual picture of

358
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,269
the address the people there that we
leave it there there was 1600

359
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:44,279
Pennsylvania Avenue we figured it wasn't
really worth censoring as the others in

360
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:50,990
the white house so you know it's not
really that secret I say assassins pages

361
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,460
again

362
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,970
self-declared assassins people will
claim that for the convenient price of

363
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,990
7,500 euros they might kill someone aged
twenty plus in the three continents and

364
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,139
so on

365
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:14,990
haven't checked like so far they claimed
that room or says that mostly would be

366
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:21,379
scam no way of verifying it but again if
you had the chance of putting on a

367
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:26,480
website that he's untraceable and you
know your identity will be covered and

368
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
you have the chance of getting payments
we'd the currency that is untraceable

369
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,860
itself and let's say you want to target
people who might not go to the police

370
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,269
complaining about their seven thousand
euros being stolen by a supposed hit man

371
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,600
well you see you see how this is a
really good plan to get people from

372
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,360
getting money from foods on the topic of
getting money from fools to meet your

373
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,269
new kick-started crowdfunding evil this
is pretty much it was a website called

374
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,730
that pool what they would do is that
they would have a list of high profiles

375
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,169
again

376
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,090
Barack Hussein Obama

377
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,280
Justin Bieber just because it's a
high-profile you grant not the actor the

378
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,690
other one apparently the actor it's
pretty much loved by most so they would

379
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,850
put a bounty on them two million dollars
I think it was more about mine says okay

380
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,969
let's start doing a Kickstarter campaign
here so you give us the money when we

381
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,450
reach two million dollars we promise you
we're going to hire an assassin and get

382
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,570
it done

383
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,500
shorts again you'll see Obama around so
looks like that in the region two

384
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,190
million dollars of course everything was
indeed going so moving on to some or

385
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:41,910
other stuff on the Datanalisis topic
this is a breakdown of the Urals we

386
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:49,360
collected in terms of in terms of what
kind of you are protocols we find in the

387
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,719
URLs so either than HTTP and HTTPS being
pretty much ninety percent of what we

388
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:01,580
got was interesting we see plenty of IRC
servers IRCs XMPP which is simply being

389
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,960
the job or protocol which is very
interesting because these could actually

390
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,830
be used either as a rendezvous point
from doctors or as an infrastructure for

391
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,620
botnets and CFCs and so on

392
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,810
if we go we tried to do an active ports
can only on tour hosts and this is the

393
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:23,330
actual numbers that we find lately so
pretty much 49 your seat 31 Ercis 802

394
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,020
sage which is fairly interesting when
his own this is an example of the IRC

395
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,150
servers that we could find some
Cybergirl really only most read the

396
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,710
channel dedicated to solidarity with
jailed and on most people

397
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:42,340
members of Anonymous in terms of
languages of course like normal english

398
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,530
is the most

399
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,690
is the most renowned language we could
find their Russian being a strong second

400
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:56,080
if we take them off we actually see
French German Italian Portuguese and

401
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,730
Dutch being here pretty much par with
you finish in Japanese not the man you

402
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,590
gotta say just out of interest this is
done counted the number of domains that

403
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:13,049
show that language so not is not in
terms of number of pages this is an

404
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,490
example of what we find we know for
example in the French side there's a guy

405
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:22,219
in a forum trying to sell some weapons
again

406
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:30,839
so-called 45 from 1911 so not even that
she gets a in terms of pages embedding

407
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,500
suspicious links so this is what we can
find when we look at the pages again

408
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,090
with links rated militias as an example
here you got an offering for a guy

409
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,860
trying to sell you know some credit or
pain and loggers

410
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:50,550
basically out there then keyloggers in
particular determined email

411
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,450
identification with parsley males there
and we can run some nice that these tix

412
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,120
on top of it to find you know what are
the addresses that are used out there

413
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:05,279
and so on and share interesting it's not
really too interesting the top 10 I Z

414
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,700
ZZZ like one of the main developers of I
to be so it's really not that shady you

415
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,049
got thank you to address is here and
there is something like toxic poison or

416
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,170
a bank of America one which I gotta say
this is not actual bank from america is

417
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,240
just the guy using the username you had
no idea how bankamerica and get peace if

418
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,669
you know me then they're so if you
actually check and see what our

419
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,130
dissociate so what are the other e-mail
address is that we find in the pages

420
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,340
containing the Bank of America admitted
to tour again not the bank just a user

421
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:44,700
using the name we find their interesting
addresses you're such a small cold for

422
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,359
example and I can go deep in the pages
and find posting executive for a win

423
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,490
said no code was selling some credit
card

424
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:58,299
and some approved credit cards here and
to reach you know late there on the bank

425
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,390
of America the bank was responding again
with this e-mail appearing right here

426
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:10,910
and address in there in case anyone is
interested in terms of Bitcoin we can

427
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,089
also do we also tried to scrape
everything that looks like between

428
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:21,750
addresses we found what r 1200 more or
less becoming wallets or at least

429
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,840
candidates again we run ragged season
there to find the candidates so we tried

430
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,510
to be as precise as possible
unfortunately as Marco will show you

431
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,860
there are ways on certain pages to
obfuscate between addresses so that

432
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,340
while you see them in the page in the
source of the page there in fact

433
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,900
scrambled around in terms of services we
got some money laundering service will

434
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,290
be going again

435
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,560
times are basically you send the money
to keep a fee they sort though rumbled

436
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,770
tomorrow and make some fake transactions
maybe just jump to another currency and

437
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,869
go from becoming too light coin in the
back so that your money becomes hard to

438
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:08,930
trace basically on the other side there
are between multipliers that claim and

439
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:16,790
again claimed you know they will you
send in 104 reasons again you know

440
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,080
that's what they claim this venue
particularly you wanted to look at least

441
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,380
to show its legitimacy and it's actually
showing union of the successful

442
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,380
transactions that you can't raise on the
block chain to see that in fact that we

443
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:36,250
cannot multiply them together so that
the customers let me now to malware and

444
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,140
I let Marco continue from here thanks

445
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:52,319
can talk about where and things you know
back in the nineties when you're my

446
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:53,119
little mister

447
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,180
spread like floppy disk and was just a
piece of code on your computer now a

448
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:08,390
days he's ever been so dead and its
first session time about a mile an hour

449
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:12,000
propagate a using direct download

450
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,529
sheen as much as and propagation time
when you move from one machine of a

451
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:24,369
moderate amount of the eighties code or
when you have a drop in which the second

452
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:29,470
stage model we need any frustrating for
the network to deliver a new second

453
00:38:29,470 --> 00:40:12,209
stage my love for example and also when
it comes to command and control

454
00:40:12,210 --> 00:41:32,200
and we also plot

455
00:41:32,200 --> 00:42:36,210
back to the company

456
00:42:36,210 --> 00:44:00,760
and so on top of the web which means
that no matter how to use the Kumbh

457
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,430
using a combination of Gadhafi and
they're used to make a fair

458
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:19,029
down and so a week and that such tough
so what we did we basically come by

459
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:35,710
analyzing the cold for another bad was
using a website contain of course is 500

460
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:48,820
I call when you when you basically get
to be suppressed it to you get there for

461
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,950
all three which means for me then so
peacefully condition together we can add

462
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,700
them to our system automatically

463
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:14,160
wherever you are and which are here this
goes back to February so we started to

464
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:22,240
action and more and more common control
server be introduced in the network as

465
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,819
you can see that the trend is going out
it's not my said about the japanese you

466
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:37,960
talk now we're talking about around
somewhere around somewhere is something

467
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,890
that we are tracking a lot because

468
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,390
he's an emergent and

469
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:50,879
and it's interesting to see that

470
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:58,069
in addition to the possibility of using
using video to Oscar there are somewhere

471
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:06,549
easy really interesting because he is a
deep freeze characteristics Friday he

472
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:12,960
did a robust framework to cash out and
for illicit money transfer what does it

473
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:20,069
mean it means basically if you all know
our house where wars briefly what evan

474
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:25,808
is very well going to take so basically
your computer get along fine but he is

475
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:31,589
getting creepy and you get a score of
4-2 pay in order to get your feedback

476
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:43,828
ok and usually you pay and then and then
and they be interesting things is that

477
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:48,339
when you do when you want to track some
70

478
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:56,150
the chain the weakest point is the human
so at the time when they turn basically

479
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:04,410
technology into real money is the time
when you get to know with attribution

480
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:15,359
and sure because we're usually is a said
you can be identified as one of their

481
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:22,369
Eastern all the framework for cashing
out as much as possible so what do they

482
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:23,289
do here

483
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:31,410
musically horse payment page on such as
very difficult to track

484
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:36,899
basically the server which is awesome
and so when you consider getting fucked

485
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,809
in this economy you get you have to
click on the link point you to be staged

486
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:56,770
but says by piece case I came down to
see myself so that you have to buy it

487
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:10,299
going for more than $1,000 and you have
to pay down here so itself is often the

488
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:17,049
pain is done so because it makes it even
more difficult and very interesting

489
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:24,190
things that sometimes what it does to
pay me if they ask for a pain in Bikaner

490
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:31,420
and then go for it go into light corn so
it's very difficult when they physical

491
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,950
transfer from one account to the other
to track them for further the user

492
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:41,390
defense of course he's made it very
difficult for me to be tried

493
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:49,549
Chancellor scene for it said the address
shown as a lot in the cold of the page

494
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:56,850
is actually shop so he's very difficult
this page automatically actually doing

495
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:05,839
this well bye bye week found actually go
to describe later on but

496
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:15,650
page by searching because not every text
so what happens when a machine get

497
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,380
infected by malware to generate

498
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:27,330
user coatings kinda one-time user called
and said possibly and it does to log

499
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:35,450
machine to the payment page which means
that against you as an enforcement

500
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:49,509
agency on Dec 12 crawled in Davis talk
and you cannot access to provide the

501
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:55,760
language it's been effective in
Charlotte County appear to be in Dutch

502
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,100
Shell in China so what we can do we get
our system we can their type of this

503
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:08,839
kind of any concerns for all the payment
page and we can have an estimation on

504
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,340
the number of infected users I wanna
come from as you can see here we have

505
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:20,810
basically user from different countries
in fact shop are not even speaking on

506
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:26,360
condition following by Turkish friends
Chinese and Italian

507
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,410
because the modulars

508
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:36,580
beach

509
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:46,660
and good example taking too long here so
we can have some time for questions

510
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:52,569
announced by piece of code that does
pretty much everything so he's still

511
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:59,900
confidential information such as a man
and as a bunch of functionality better

512
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:10,570
very interesting for people that does
not tax and so on and so forth because

513
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:21,240
we call it out of you and idea here is
that what we look at me look at where

514
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:28,000
there are in he cannot emerging trend

515
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,060
kind of surge in popularity of values
associated with testing meters radius of

516
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:47,200
their fear you didn't see what happens
when a machine get infected

517
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,080
what it does to communicate to the
command-and-control server about ok if

518
00:51:52,080 --> 00:52:00,950
he doesn't like weary stranger parameter
as you can see here which is so

519
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:06,009
ubiquitous parameter for example this
parameter can leave a blob JSON

520
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:11,380
reporting in section so if I hadn't
shown in a very short amount of time you

521
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:20,000
see be seeking a spike like this one so
yeah this spike of one parameter and so

522
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:27,060
what do we ever be together we can
automatically yet another blow out of

523
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:32,240
this case and if you're going to take
what they can tell you is that despite

524
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:45,279
Xu experience which surged in popularity
last a while what's going on here so we

525
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:55,810
do get better and we saw that they can
turn out that these wars basically the

526
00:52:55,810 --> 00:53:02,090
data from voting machine so I'm already
using get to communicate the data is

527
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:13,610
that the past two weekends so you can
shop together with machine and all the

528
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:18,390
information we can plotted here so we
can plot the

529
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:25,980
the traffic over a bit too parameter and
we can see that deal yeah we very blue

530
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:32,299
yeah so when I'm not a fashion is going
down well it was pretty dunno what we

531
00:53:32,299 --> 00:53:37,259
had that one day in the middle of
nowhere he's me maybe we've all the time

532
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:44,740
to read new victim and the same with the
trash so it's a nice we can do something

533
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:51,470
better get so basically the take home
yet for today that two me together

534
00:53:51,470 --> 00:54:03,848
nearly $10 billion debt collection and
analysis before and you actually using

535
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:09,269
it using it to detect different type of
us and our communities such as training

536
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:17,209
of God has no major show we are tracing
underground forums and marketplaces

537
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,480
understand what's going on we we want to
do in the future some ultimate analysis

538
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:27,950
and correlation of defending made a blog
post understanding which are talking to

539
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:37,580
own blog well correlated with the
surface web site where users

540
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:55,650
where we have a couple of minutes for
questions thanks a lot for listening

541
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,490
hope you enjoyed what we had today
