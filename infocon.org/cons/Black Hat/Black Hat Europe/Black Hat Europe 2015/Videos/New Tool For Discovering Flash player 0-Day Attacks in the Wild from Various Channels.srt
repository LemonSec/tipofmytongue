00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
hello everyone thank you for coming to
my topic in this session I will show

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,649
some wear a mask of discovering / do
they are you place in the wild and we're

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,369
also we are introduced a little tour I
want to identify flash their day

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:31,429
exploring this is my agenda first I am
research of China macro there they

5
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:38,690
discovered him and I'm also be able to
Union developer I G thirteen discovering

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:46,110
what it is and the readiness points
currently I folk song / joy system and

7
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,760
OS X

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,209
discovered several flash point in the
wild and also have reported that endorse

9
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:33,880
and Joyce's 10 bucks to go and I am also
doing some research on OS X 253 last

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,250
year we can have seen that there there
tax jackie's mostly Flash Player

11
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:58,579
2538 begins we see me 2000 1500 and yet
so in this situation after Microsoft

12
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:09,049
introduced isolated sheep and memory
protector in 2040 I guessed that flash

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,050
player will be the most

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,540
popular tacky in 2050 so I decided to
something to catch Flash Player terror

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:29,540
attacks in 2050 to achieve these goals
are two problems need to be solved the

16
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:38,239
first problem is how to get affecting
somebody out and you'd find some sorting

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,200
channels can provide effective stumbles
into out and the second problem needs

18
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,420
how to identify their days from Dec
samples because of this number may be

19
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:06,079
where large you need a commission
process so I we are introduced some some

20
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:15,440
attorneys are you the first loss in
China products feedback daylight long

21
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:27,829
established samples from products are
you back and then you come back come

22
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:35,410
every day this affection because they
are to help you filter by products or

23
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:42,049
unions detection protection laws affect
you

24
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:56,650
second source in journalism degree to
December the suicide decide decide to

25
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,110
check which exploit

26
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:10,870
insistence job are wishing you know to
set aside a weird cheek Java exploit and

27
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:19,459
I thought all / ignored so if you catch
it and all the jobs in order I see the

28
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,639
detection you can cross

29
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:36,960
you are you up to date system it may
trigger flash point so this kind of you

30
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:47,888
are there were a total intelligence
there are so many estaba samples can be

31
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:59,000
done away from using various tournaments
results showed that there may be some 80

32
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,259
22 before it was before you towards the
school to public that hackers

33
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:22,439
showed a POC to check the immediate
action to force sourcing channel you are

34
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,830
you compare your eyes may have some
petty

35
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:35,599
track one kind of campaign finance a
patent on the house and then so you can

36
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:46,029
catch the scandal and wisdom to detect I
got many yards from about sourcing

37
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:51,759
channels so I need a tool to help me
identify their day from this kind of

38
00:05:51,759 --> 00:06:01,899
something must have no for sale because
the longer you large solar facility

39
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:12,810
hi this is a difficult to identify and
block to recoup record exploit and they

40
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:21,620
have promised so I write a little tool
to help me i i caught at a loss to

41
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:29,729
flashing AV f ed I write him by C++

42
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,800
/ I process

43
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,770
to detect it also I standard you want to
get current URL them and they can write

44
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:55,560
actions and behaviors to log fire CD I
made a simple process just register f ed

45
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:04,319
and every time no DUI are you f ed will
flash or sext attacked you we are right

46
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:15,370
detection and barriers to finish or past
the log file with your self defined the

47
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,319
rules to output results so how to
implement ed

48
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,430
Adobe introduced to work to object
manipulation in June I with the help of

49
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:38,250
google project zero before the object of
flash Voice you'd crafted

50
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:45,759
object to this is because cropped one
work to object to worry D and you can

51
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:59,690
read and write to crap crap to do work
to object type call for free before

52
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:15,509
meeting ocean you can see Dad the first
top deputies 2012 object and then worked

53
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:21,979
object using object you can read and
write the process memory and you can I

54
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:35,169
don't do anything you want I can

55
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:44,600
did did you ideally detection ideally
after

56
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,290
beauty has been triggered we can checked
to act object even

57
00:08:51,290 --> 00:09:04,069
Angus lang selected object we can see
that the lockheed so I need a chance to

58
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:13,500
check point to check their work relax so
I hawk CIT point of barium to almost

59
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:25,790
each three message we r BG aidid before
it called first time such a key point we

60
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,199
have chance to check worked on the
project length so practically

61
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:36,170
practically it is like this before

62
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,649
steps dat hope we can check

63
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:54,240
object thanks I hope the key functions
offered judge basically you too cute and

64
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:08,930
manner you can be found in every class
almost project we can get airstream SLN

65
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:27,050
structure and then we can also get so
how to check their work I hoped that

66
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,670
creating

67
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:41,439
names at hand played a function named a
new class project which create objects

68
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:57,070
because they are four types so for you
since in binary after creating you can

69
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,900
get a direct address so you can use this
formula

70
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:12,260
together working length of an early
detection from law before mitigation

71
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:24,100
steps I can seem there worked object IDs
and Jackie hopeful machines I can use

72
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,940
the saved

73
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:40,960
objects to check before mediation but
after seeing such scenes changed it

74
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,500
continues to object to you thought they
are no objects before you download the

75
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,150
latest Flash video D

76
00:11:51,150 --> 00:12:05,600
2057 6456 exploit you by Tyree based
object Biola writing battery thanks you

77
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:23,150
too can achieve up to read and write /
AP D Alene ID checked jacket she could I

78
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,240
found that

79
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:38,740
pro-law goes almost like this so i cant
talk first about to record each and

80
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:59,060
every you can get and GHG need addressed
by honking overfly job so I can taste so

81
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:09,329
I can print the chase to log fire like
this so I so I called this is some post

82
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:18,760
behaviour because each function space
objects function we can you recall the

83
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:32,970
behaviour so I can add a rules-based on
the battery chemistry a few deal will

84
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:47,250
print / utils battery to the log file
because of this constructor so I can add

85
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,630
a rule to detect

86
00:13:49,630 --> 00:14:02,050
battery chemistry teacher rules can be
edited by an ICC from a recent choice

87
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:11,189
all your experience for your number
recently voice also use bitmap data he

88
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:21,020
was free so you can add a rule to magic
or beaten them data contractor to detect

89
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:32,160
I have seen we need to flash

90
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:41,709
loading do like we do know that you
meant so I hope to come

91
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:52,689
punishing code get a class object
function I can use a class I D to

92
00:14:52,690 --> 00:15:09,709
identify flash is being loaded are not
okay so we can use this improvement

93
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:29,180
everybody to check voice ok ABM from my
face and Google project zero blocked

94
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:37,739
about communications ok thank you

95
00:15:37,740 --> 00:16:31,640
that their accounts ok ok so I can craft

96
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:45,910
argument from lead from before you get
caught so this can reach it could amount

97
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:57,069
to chase yet you choose the wrong kind
of both longtime companion so you can

98
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:06,640
decide to style yes

99
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,810
okay thank you
