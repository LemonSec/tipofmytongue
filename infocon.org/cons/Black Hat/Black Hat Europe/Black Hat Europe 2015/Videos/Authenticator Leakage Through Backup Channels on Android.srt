1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180
ok show us stop it saves time for us to
stop and thank you for coming my name is

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,629
spike London and Siam Palace talk and
research photo from National University

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,240
of Singapore and my research is on the
security of total costs including

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,439
authentication protocol single sign-on
and some postal costs related to trusted

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,189
computing so this later today as talk
I'm going to look at the authentication

6
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:39,850
protocols and compromise to backup
journalist so as more and more

7
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,809
applications years that they left daily
life and a lot of web service is

8
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,640
increasingly delivered soon and
replications here I want to shoot some

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,010
example in the social social networking
for example in this book interested

10
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:06,890
parties that never all mobile user us on
Facebook has deposit members all the

11
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,619
tests that stop you there us and also
online banking week we can say that

12
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:22,070
access their own i bum cancer
applications are increasing and and it

13
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,880
is estimated that and it is all that
mTOR there may be more than 80% of your

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:37,280
us access that mobile banking mobile
applications and also a massive assess

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,689
and analyze the president's not use our
set access that email service to know

16
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:52,859
mobile applications we can say that the
numbers dramatically increasing so no

17
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,070
problem is can't we just simply reduced
to wipe all tears to access those swaps

18
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:05,939
arrested us and we know that there are
two options when to implement interface

19
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,120
of the website of this the first one as
soon on native application and second

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,830
twice

21
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,830
and they have some indigenous and kiss
kiss at the Monday juice for example if

22
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,760
we implant dentists in the native
applications would have to use off lefty

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,920
lies and lies provided by the operating
system and also there s Plus program and

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,790
limitation and also a native application
is drawing them faster than that based

25
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,450
application ok and if all the web
browser-based application and can you

26
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,200
know like a lot implementation and
multiple years and also it can be used

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,829
to pull the loans but developed
functionality is provided by the US for

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:11,690
example in NJ and some security
mechanisms like same origin policies and

29
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,230
also it can be developed faster because
you just need to fill up a while and it

30
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,160
can be a lot a lot different web all
this so the question is why would you

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:32,750
not just simply there let's just look at
rallied to outside this question so

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:39,350
until all without a start and that just
about seventy percent of that just about

33
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:48,470
to 20% what he says I think it was all
there and the number is increasing so

34
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:56,400
that paula has become a single
application swimming in a sea of

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,709
applications so in this and they're us
let's look at how about vacations or

36
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:10,040
walk and what kind of goes mobile
applications play in this scenario is

37
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,260
centrally the mobile application to join
a lack the web all there at first you

38
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,440
know some communication protocols to
fetch content from the web server and

39
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,820
then do some contemporary

40
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:32,000
if we look at multiple vulnerabilities
in a web of their

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,330
understand that this task is very hot
and complicate the task for example on

42
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,130
the content rendering side that maybe
some code injection attacks which means

43
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,840
attacker can somehow and Jack some
malicious code into the content that

44
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,289
starts by the application and this may
lead to some in a cross-site scripting

45
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:06,770
as some Sissoko injection attacks and
that lots of research has followed this

46
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:19,859
this site for the other side of the web
application or use some communication

47
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:28,170
protocol us to factual content and if we
say this this application runs on

48
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,510
Android side not maybe some new attack
surface and there may be some new

49
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:40,580
trusted computing base which means snow
and replications muscles relax this

50
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,090
assumption to make the communication
protocol is secure

51
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:52,260
you so this continent focus after
there's talk turned to look at how

52
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:00,890
current applications were implement
authentication schemes and look at this

53
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:07,380
authentication protocols works and will
look a hold on syndicator which means

54
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,469
some credentials in syndication
protocols and hold this also managed by

55
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:22,230
the application and as we just mentioned
that and that may be new attack surface

56
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:30,470
introduced in Andhra side so I look at
their backup channel which I believe is

57
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,639
attacks are fast web authentication
particles

58
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,430
mostly were introduced how the backup
can be dangerous to to the US and Asia

59
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,340
and whereas a whole week abuse this
backup journalist and lots of a look at

60
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,580
some case study to show that pic to
ensure that impact of such kind of

61
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:06,270
threat ok first part of something under
it and you must perform lol celebs and

62
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,169
Acacia senegal syndication best clears
up process by suicide to come for a

63
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:22,568
while lined is who is declared and this
must be one of the most sweetest website

64
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:36,219
or want to look under applications web
authentication schemes and our goal is

65
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:44,770
to learn approach this car and come to
applications used to implement their

66
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:54,128
awesome t-shirts games and we will focus
manager way have analyzed manage them

67
00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:01,069
last the culprit 100 applications from
Google Play and while I'm a sub as clear

68
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:11,120
as engineering and traffic and that's
this shot summary our results from this

69
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:23,089
top 100 application with on that now 66
applications and that's there are still

70
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:27,409
a catchy chorus of authentication
schemes basically have a cover shuttle

71
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,458
in my talk and including the basic
authentication and single sign-on

72
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:42,828
manager so other certifications white
light on the authentication schemes

73
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:49,390
because most of us stand alone
application for example new spot there

74
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:56,260
and maps and we do play us which do not
need basically the ideals as a condom

75
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:05,430
December ok so the first game now basic
authentication so the basic

76
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,459
authentication request to the
traditional authentication schemes which

77
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,250
can be in a sub kuch go it into three
kinds of first so I is based on the

78
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,020
knowledge for example in the password
based some security questions and we

79
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,460
thought that their typical application
salt on the float implication use this

80
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,290
password based schemes and for the
second cat go it's almost passed which

81
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:42,110
means no syndication several films that
the client holds some old some device or

82
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,160
something that is special to that client
for example is up SMS short message best

83
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:58,230
and some some one-time password past
kings and also there is another category

84
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,910
caught insurance which means no
syndication space some special things on

85
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:11,020
the client for example the fingerprint
and even a two part hence but what you

86
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:19,270
mean what did that fine line application
status Harbor the system to carry around

87
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:26,400
spaces authentication for example in
some measure of Android new devices they

88
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:33,800
used a fingerprint to unlock the device
ok and I were introduced you that there

89
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,430
is also there was some work which tried
to investigate the confidentiality of

90
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:50,160
this fingerprints that was presented in
this year s black had urs so let's do

91
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,589
some obstruction all the basic
authentication works

92
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:03,280
and in the tax and the desktop side
swept off their ass and some username

93
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,420
and password to the web server and web
server but generally

94
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,550
credentials like SessionID like some
credential cookies and there's a planted

95
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:20,760
into the web other so called their
screen Angeles which means that can

96
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:27,010
indicate the client login session and
example including what I mentioned just

97
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:42,420
took a social I D S 000 US Code so does
not what this basically some same origin

98
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:50,900
policy arcan 10 security policy
mechanisms however let's look at and

99
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,680
replication what do this so basically
the under applications of some rest for

100
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,569
you which was mentioned by previous
speaker so and replication and your sis

101
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:14,950
to interface to stand up and tell us
where to set aside and let me know

102
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:21,140
several silent generator and this also
indicate out locate and look at it and

103
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,580
to enjoy side near the user put it into
the content provider are you some sharp

104
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:35,150
harass preference to stall this
syndicators so eventually there's also

105
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:42,449
the cows are located in internal storage
is about this application which located

106
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:52,540
in the database application this photo
okay so the second scheme has caused

107
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,649
single sign-on

108
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,369
and also was stopped from the desktop
side I believe must have you have the

109
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:05,949
catalyst is especially as a spot which
means you can use like Facebook eydie

110
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:12,569
eydie to log into a certified hit pick
up party websites in which causes a

111
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:18,329
single site basically kept us like a
single credential authentication schemes

112
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:25,040
and now a lot off in a major companies
have implemented this single sound for

113
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,759
example by the idea of this book so
that's a partisan this was our first

114
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:40,009
inside you and are and to the USS and is
just a name and password so i didnt

115
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:47,019
identity provider which we call it I did
P and the gas some token from and later

116
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,069
they use our president this token to
their party which would cause you're

117
00:13:52,069 --> 00:14:00,829
relying party RRP and this token alone
that goes out to log in to this party so

118
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:10,209
let's think about what is aside the real
I'm parking now becomes application and

119
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:16,319
if this application wants two years
single assassin services provided by

120
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:23,959
some idea it or in part is released by
the IDP

121
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,209
examples include in the Facebook Connect
to tie basically means this application

122
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:41,790
can lock into enough along the girls are
two locking their facebook idid

123
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,939
I want to use a concrete example to show
this process and this wireless

124
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:56,259
Facebook Connect and we divided into two
parts left hand side pot as just an air

125
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:03,499
of that there is no Facebook need to be
implemented on the device so what we're

126
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:07,050
last decade do it were an issue

127
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:16,019
component and do the authentication
server and this post to Facebook server

128
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:23,500
would generate some secret kooky later
this cookie is just us credential 20

129
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,570
loss access token from test books ever
and for this scenario most sacred cow

130
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,490
case belonging to Facebook and no lost
access token belonging to the shop is

131
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:44,730
located in internal storage of the IP
application and they're dry hands size

132
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,070
scenario shows that is not as native
Facebook implemented in the Android

133
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,130
device

134
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:00,860
up to crest I did namely the Facebook
application application last and

135
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,670
username and password to this summer and
got the cookie and a loss access to and

136
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,649
it puts just a quick look into its own
internal storage and then put trance

137
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:23,329
main access to come to the occupation so
you can say that this kind of this to

138
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,569
kind of Law Center located in two
different places and you can't just keep

139
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,470
this in mind and later issue the problem
so the last occasion scheme is caught

140
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:43,110
under a car manager and I think most of
your house say this so which means you

141
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:50,199
can add some accounts into the system so
this account manager us is a centralized

142
00:16:50,199 --> 00:17:00,370
and delegated authentication service and
Account Manager so app developer can

143
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:08,189
only need to implement some some
interface that it can't allocate the

144
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,579
whole authentication process and the
authenticator manager management to the

145
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,379
account manager so that's where this
horror walks in a developer

146
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,670
are basically need to implement two
things first why is a kind of Santa

147
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,650
Clara which means ok what kind of
account

148
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:37,360
going two years and what kind of pipe is
not a comment and develop policies need

149
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,240
to create opportunity sewage now shows
are canceled his dangerous

150
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,810
up after this attempt to Qatar where you
know there was also an account manager

151
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:55,169
what does also indicate a managed
management and it will load all the

152
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,470
authentic air into the database located
in this photo which is which belongs to

153
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:14,680
no system let our share this link above
the protocol security will probably have

154
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,900
some have sweet layers the first two
layers I'm not design level so which

155
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:28,400
mass some particles can be designed for
example miss which lead to replace

156
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,790
attack on me some signature which lead
to man the middle attack so basically

157
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,310
warehouse some True Light Programme
reflect at the attacks such kind of

158
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:46,960
design level problem and that's the
Cowboys implementation level so the

159
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,020
basic idea is even the protocol designed
to secure the implementation can

160
00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:02,190
introduce some box and in this case and
not the messages are covered by the

161
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:09,290
signature which provides a chance to
attack her man Amendola tack and also

162
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:16,770
some awesome to cows can be implemented
passable by the attack her ok so this to

163
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:24,460
traditional later assets such as most a
single ball and here we want we want to

164
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,180
remind that we probably need to think
about the infrastructure level because

165
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,240
the coat implementation costs

166
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,710
eventually rely on some software stacks
to walk so what if this software stack a

167
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:49,190
compromise so there is some previous
study to look at the bus the possible

168
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,330
leakage soon a compromise could be
trouble and that's why I was prevented

169
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,560
did call last year

170
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:05,020
ok so let's keep in mind the
infrastructural level of security and we

171
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,139
review the weekends off

172
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:15,570
authentication schemes in the basic
authentication eventually located in to

173
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:23,399
the internal storage of the app and
singles outcasts authenticate harris

174
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,380
also located in the story

175
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:35,380
internal storage apps so that's that's
this this is an internal storage located

176
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:43,950
in a data folder and we can say in the
owner of this is not a good idea of an

177
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:51,010
application and we look at the account
manager call center located in this

178
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:57,450
state US system goes up there and the
owner of this phone is not system so

179
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,440
let's look at heart

180
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:08,530
it to a bit different of this this kind
of management so before that I would

181
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:15,100
cause I'll Asian mechanism and do it
which was introduced by the previous

182
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:23,280
speaker so we know that its application
in Adelaide his sandbox lets me set it

183
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,280
off its application can only access
internal storage and even some

184
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,960
applications compromise between not get
access to the kind of story but the

185
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,610
problem is that maybe some just came
less which means we do some obstruction

186
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,149
it's not application

187
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:49,008
simply located the authenticator into
its internal storage

188
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:56,710
wanna ask what if this kind of Sam
bosses bypassed do you think there's any

189
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,239
chance

190
00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:07,239
yes that s if we think of all the backup
function which is useful functionality

191
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:17,080
so no backup function the backup
function is basically works like this we

192
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,678
have some indication which ones to back
up that they have been known to not

193
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:31,080
application is centrally this risks
embossed must be very late in the second

194
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:39,749
part of car do in their spare copy
countryside and there are two hours of

195
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:42,289
backup onto it

196
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:48,529
the first one is called a route based
backup which mask off the duty in the

197
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:56,070
device backup application can be counted
huge privilege that it naturally have

198
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,799
access to any other applications
internal storage and the second-highest

199
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:07,269
call that lady back a debased up a cop
let's look at this interview based

200
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:15,389
backup so I i believe are you know
there's a space basically at the barber

201
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:29,449
bridge so strong so higher probability
than the traditional applications than

202
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:37,269
the normal acacia is lower than root it
can have some prevented that some

203
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:49,690
obligation does not have so many basic
backup walk and then come up under a

204
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,990
device and the backup app

205
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:02,620
the backup allowable limit so how do I
implement that a cop was simply connect

206
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:15,459
Android device to the PC and Ross Fisher
and process to start process under aside

207
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:22,650
and this one work out the privilege of
the same basically a system-level a

208
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:29,309
signature low that it would have the
privilege to do the backup and

209
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,399
application on it

210
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:42,980
invoking this product is safe to do a
backup ok so a little detail when they

211
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:50,490
were used as comment be a cop and which
would generate some backup data which is

212
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:59,840
up on Mad Dog baby let's look at this
basically it has a magic and repair shop

213
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:10,409
and has some Russian and also specify
some encryption and by default this can

214
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:19,679
be now which means as a backup data were
not be encrypted so this is hard that

215
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:27,340
are less heart less common artworks so
whilst not this why is that clear tape

216
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:33,350
there will be some into fist pumped to
the user and the user can choose to pick

217
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:43,340
up my app so hard this backup channel
can be restored to the authentication

218
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:53,459
protocol the first what if the backup
application locate our belonged to the

219
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:59,990
victim application to some globally
routable storage then the malicious app

220
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,950
can just read that to come and take care

221
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:15,620
Eden Park say it's not excess is not
controlled a protected from malicious

222
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:29,010
app also in local proxy to the backup
and will call for backup data linkage

223
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:41,610
and the second case backup capability to
cage so we have summarized backup

224
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:48,019
applications on the Google Play and so a
fund that that about five applications

225
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:54,320
and flawed best and with all of them all
the applications

226
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,730
ok the backup data into the car and said
there s another it did you based

227
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:08,260
application called halo which US and the
cat back update optimistic and also to

228
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,840
have some interface that compromised
which I'm going to introduce you next

229
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:24,350
slide this database up a copy of Halo
and it is reported us while the best

230
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,699
application 2010 starting and develop
artists and develop policy and remote

231
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,539
which I believe you know this and they
have already released night implications

232
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:42,279
and a camera led to millions estas soy
yo sista sure that even some advanced

233
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:48,120
developer can also make some mistakes
which lead to the culpability indicates

234
00:27:48,120 --> 00:28:12,449
January 22 and epoxy share around 10
years our top runner from the PC its

235
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,240
common stock service center in tampa to
the system

236
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,390
initiative to to stop the man up and
this stage it also send a long-time

237
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:35,910
password to the up to the hill this
one-time password is internal storage

238
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:45,720
and then this year run a carregar a la
casa socket sock a starter and if you

239
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:53,080
want to do the backup it to us and to
access this press and induce a one-time

240
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,220
password credential

241
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,540
think about there's a soccer several
listen there and that's a client and the

242
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:13,639
client Carsten the server backup and
induce a one-time password so I lost two

243
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:23,920
kinds of interest of us were SLR care
activity to the backup and the model is

244
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,940
called a long call back up and the
backup data is located in the car and a

245
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,360
dish assess

246
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:44,070
also correct HTTP server so I can access
this actually be server

247
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:58,200
his PC and her across the back on this
and we have some protected park say

248
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:09,020
which is protected by the long-time plus
work and the men were sent this to

249
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:16,800
invoke toxic so basically it works in
this way

250
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:36,740
so little on the code to share housework
and initially the park says . read it

251
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,490
generates UUID you can sink it

252
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:49,630
US company number and this idea is just
us so how this all this one-time

253
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:56,690
password is transmedia to view them as
clear it were calling this function

254
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,660
called pork hospice work and that's how
this works

255
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:13,090
common stock service and Jeremy taul the
one-time password so basically this one

256
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:19,929
where generate content and send their
intent to sharp sharp access service

257
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:30,400
which is why so far that one time
password is transmitted to the map of

258
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:42,360
his and we can find a larger floor here
if we look at this this look trust me to

259
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,990
the one-time password to the top of Hilo

260
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:53,780
parks a while sucki summer on the
request so let's say a left-hander

261
00:31:53,780 --> 00:32:01,730
secular works basically it's a fine I
just gather across from Cherokee the

262
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:09,450
lunchtime if yes it was somewhere across
otherwise general without exception so

263
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:17,640
let's look at this possum if the
one-time password is the exception so it

264
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:26,590
was called that's why and Asia where
exit this function

265
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:33,399
that's the color happened it would enter
the park us +1 again this print think

266
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,890
about if the helium installed by the
year there are some heart attack are

267
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:47,130
installed which has the same name of the
helo what will happen to the park say

268
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:53,179
where and how this again I execute this
command again so basically the one-time

269
00:32:53,179 --> 00:33:04,120
password was sent to the right idea said
this is conquered attack process and we

270
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:12,570
can do some issues on this attack
basically it is not that is a because it

271
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:19,309
to across a he asked by the user and
also an attack on a suit install

272
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:27,070
malicious application which have the
same name as a halo night manager for

273
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:34,960
the power crisis at once up ten work
camps up shop at any time because it

274
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:44,350
just need to one-time password scripting
sure to cost proxy and another problem

275
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:58,668
as on the park see which means it's what
iraq to the execute the comment that

276
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:06,340
absence of it so basically the attacker
can generate comments it wants no parts

277
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:13,449
8 2010 sent an epoxy and this comment
will appear on signature level

278
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:23,558
get another attack is tacked up

279
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:33,759
are based on a cop which I mentioned
before so it should be sober and list

280
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:45,969
them cart so any application which has
internet Commission where you know it's

281
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:52,079
able to invoke this is able to access
this part right

282
00:34:52,079 --> 00:35:02,209
centenary and defined out the interface
and a basically no malicious app only

283
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:09,808
need to access this you are and sent a
cat achieve you gather request to search

284
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:17,170
the list of installed application that
can send a poster costs to do the backup

285
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:31,279
and restore so it's clear we also do it
again attacked her that this advantage

286
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:39,559
if attacked Ras now she needs to be
opened by the rules are by default is

287
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:48,959
closed and also the application internet
Premiership Harbor attack our is it also

288
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:55,448
come back up the talking with
application and the time and it is in

289
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:05,650
there to implement than the first attack
attack because the backup data is

290
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,150
located and arrested cock so the
malicious application can directly

291
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:17,920
access sdcard blow it up but the pump
that the settlement follows up attack

292
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:30,279
this success was used as a backup on the
target application and advantages

293
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:33,579
obviously that it is

294
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:36,559
Clement

295
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:43,180
so far we have I have introduced how we
can compromise about syndication put the

296
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:53,259
cost by compromising backup journalist
and thus are prob going to this impact

297
00:36:53,259 --> 00:37:02,920
of real-life application so firstly
let's look at that extends to be back up

298
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:14,589
and wants to know that application once
not be able to back up by the park say

299
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:21,959
if it is used under account manager for
syndication because if you remember also

300
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:29,219
indicate her is located in the system's
voter guides account manager in the

301
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:35,529
second case is if the application set up
under a low back up to force it to be

302
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:42,089
back by Deepak said where failed to back
up the occasion are about this by

303
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:49,259
default is true this is true and so we
find that only less than 10% application

304
00:37:49,259 --> 00:38:03,349
west by seven and please sit to
explicitly into for us to look at how

305
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:09,759
many apps were be subject to this attack
besides the previous top and reliable

306
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:14,900
occasion we also randomly choose ten
categories

307
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:22,469
application from Google Play and awake
at each category so basically we do this

308
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:29,049
but first back up this application and
get that back up and then way restart

309
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:35,400
this data into another application to
say whether we can't look into the

310
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:47,999
weekend car so that's why I find that
their application in fact it and there

311
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,669
are totally

312
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:57,290
120 applications which were not be
impacted because eighty three of them

313
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:07,058
does not use authentication and 37 of
the month of december 23

314
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:20,530
Account Manager which if you remember
when not be impacted by this attack and

315
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:27,240
I would find that that part implications
explicitly specified that they do not

316
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:35,069
allowed to be back up so that would not
be subject to this attack ok I want to

317
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:43,308
share some Chris sorry this one is a tax
cut as a Facebook application so capture

318
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:50,760
the messages exchanged by the Facebook
native application of his books ever and

319
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,510
we find that there is a post a request
from facebook app to the server and in a

320
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,290
sense your name and password to the
server and then a server where reply

321
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:13,980
access toca and took place while
Coliseum deals are now the context as we

322
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,470
investigate them and find that this
access to its basically a quiet down

323
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:25,109
show in subsequent requests for example
they use i cant yes it to post a new

324
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:31,170
post and took ok see you as I and excess
are quite dangerous indicating the

325
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,750
jewels jewels are has to log into
Facebook ok

326
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:43,630
located in in this database and located
in this book

327
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:52,730
internal story which mass if we can't
get the back of the Facebook application

328
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:00,069
post anything access to and we can log
into the LinkedIn account is a safe

329
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:02,570
access

330
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:11,620
and the second case study is no Facebook
single sign-on so basically like to

331
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:18,910
review a bit far less Facebook single
sound works for both cleaner user

332
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:25,600
username and pass work and Facebook esta
KY send it to Facebook summer and

333
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,730
gathers took place if you're still
members to cook and let her use them to

334
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:36,680
gather took from this book summer so
this process is also in the kitchen put

335
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,620
process and besides s facebook
employment also rather show which means

336
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:48,910
labor and popular location and just as
lost took a skirt natural gas some

337
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:55,480
information on the best books ever so
basically the user has also has to

338
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:04,070
authorize this process which would call
it also so what would happen if the

339
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:11,470
attacker can get this could kiss
basically lets a user and access which

340
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:17,959
belonged to facebook.com and 2000 are
located in internal storage of the

341
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,510
popular acacia

342
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:30,630
a problem bears Facebook completely on
the sticker case an obligation

343
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:37,470
which means if application along this to
cookies to be back up that Packer can't

344
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:47,470
log into Facebook accounts and anything
he wants so this company later the

345
00:42:47,470 --> 00:43:02,348
authorization which is an issue in terms
of their single sound waves of this

346
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:10,839
opinion is completely trust application
because they think that if the

347
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,420
application is not trustworthy see that
can you please contact us or but the

348
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:27,130
problem is if to control spoke it casts
at a low back up to false to protect

349
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:33,990
them but if the offender gave this to
kiss to the popular application that if

350
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:44,479
I love by congress centre false can be
subject to attack so the last part of

351
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:53,039
this attack suppressed clear for
developer job application this year

352
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:59,440
tried to build some security based up a
cop which means they should prevent

353
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,619
waste cleanup backup data backup
privilege for exposing to some malicious

354
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:14,000
application so they should have some
control mechanism or even formally

355
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,190
verified epoxy side and they should
think about the secre sell backup data

356
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:29,519
and of course they should manage the
lifecycle of it did you park see which

357
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:40,399
means wants number of the backdrop is an
start the park say shouldn't be there

358
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,069
and thought that developers of web
applications they should try to protect

359
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:52,829
their doors for example if it is not
necessary they should disable this

360
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:58,859
fellow backup and also they should avoid
starring surplus or applications

361
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:06,710
internal storage and then to try to shot
a lot of time off the bus and most

362
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:14,289
importantly they should try to avoid
implementing their management just you

363
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:24,579
know manager so the last let's play some
summary take a waste but it's clear we

364
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:31,260
look at compromise a backup journalist
and packed the security of web

365
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:39,690
authentication protocol so this was we
implement some functionality is up 12

366
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:45,410
relayed that is essential protection
mechanisms offered operating system we

367
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,129
should think about it what it is

368
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:55,309
implement his suc- because we're
actually push the boundary which book

369
00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:01,010
the sandbox boys and putting research
and screen maker so they've basically

370
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:10,289
some epoxy do the screenshot and the
park say is now over country road which

371
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:17,869
means any application can invoke epoxy
ok well I think about the security of

372
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:27,440
all syndication we should employ a
structural level attacks oK so that's

373
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,950
off this talk thank you
