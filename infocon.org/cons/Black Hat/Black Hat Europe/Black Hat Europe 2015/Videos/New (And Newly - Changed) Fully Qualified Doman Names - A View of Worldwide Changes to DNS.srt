1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,069
I am Baltic Sea from for site security I
am very gratified to see so many people

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,750
coming up through this is a topic that
is at best

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,400
terminally obscure and geeky and I i was
thinkin nobody loves this stuff but me

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,180
so much I'll talk a bit about passive
DNS and some interesting conclusions

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,730
that we have come to using passive DNS
turns out you could do more with it than

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,850
making daily basis that you do lookups
on which were exploring some of these

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,980
some of what I want to describe our
commercial products but all over

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,140
commercial products are also made
available free of charge to academic

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,460
users or other people who have sort of
superhero second lives where they're not

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,469
paid for the work they do that uses our
stuff so please don't treat this as a

11
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:01,449
commercial presentation if you have some
idea of how to make the internet safer

12
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,759
or how to do study using this please
contact me I'm always interested in

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,280
grant proposals of that kind

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,110
nevertheless this is all output from a
commercial company and I'm very

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:24,850
interested in some of the conclusions I
can draw about the global DNS that we're

16
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,908
not really possible in my previous
nonprofit world in other words takes

17
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,799
quite a bit of equipment and people to
come up with some of the stuff so these

18
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,970
slides are available there was some kind
of an online proceedings available from

19
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,048
blackhead Europe and you will have a
copy of the slides and you know that

20
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,040
there are almost 60 of them I'm not
gonna go through them in detail the

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,189
reason we have very detailed slides in
case you want to read up afterward what

22
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,398
I really want to do is get through sort
of the top level of the material and

23
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,820
save time for questions

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,639
so I'm I'm counting on you guys to not
be shy leave time at the end it will be

25
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:18,519
wasted if you don't use it for questions
so everything you do on the Internet

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,720
everything anybody does on the Internet
statistically speaking begins with the

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,359
DNS transaction every mouse click every
finger tap everything you're doing every

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,670
email you send every website you visit
is going to form some number of tcp/ip

29
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,179
sessions that you probably know about
how those are constructed in terms of

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,160
the packets but in order to figure out
where to send the control signals of

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,540
tcp/ip DNS transaction is done first
what's interesting there is I really do

32
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,850
mean all activities in other words
everything that any good person or any

33
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,640
malicious person wants to do is going to
begin with a DNS transaction and

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,070
certainly the world's intelligence
services various governments of

35
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,380
discovered the DNS is a wonderful day
tomorrow I'm going to go look at what

36
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,900
people are looking up in order to figure
out what their interests are no doubt

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,650
some of the commercial social networking
companies are doing the same I am going

38
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,400
to describe our approach to personally
identifiable information later but the

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,090
important thing for now is to just
realized that if you are malicious

40
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,420
person and you want to do bad things are
going to be incentive in Sandton your

41
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,179
victims to make DNS lookups domain names
that you control or make DNS lookups

42
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,459
that lead to addresses that you control
or maybe name servers that you control

43
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,590
and so by trying to set up the malicious
infrastructure that will be used to

44
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,269
victimize people you're going to have to
put things into the DNS is an awful lot

45
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,610
of anonymity on the internet and
certainly with who is law enforcement

46
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,580
services around the world of told me
that it is absolutely hopeless to

47
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,310
use who is to go find out who did what
to whom for attribution or recourse or

48
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,420
whatever you know part of that is
because of who is privacy where there is

49
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,780
a large number of people who are
concerned about activism political

50
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,270
activism and the possibility that a
nation state could act against its own

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,530
citizens if they then had a like a
protest website or whatever I don't

52
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,270
think that's the biggest use of DNA
whois privacy I think criminals are more

53
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,909
likely to be doing that but even when
you don't use whois privacy you don't

54
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,240
really have to use an accurate home
address or phone number or anything else

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:57,060
so we think of who is as a joke but this
is not a joke if you don't put the truth

56
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,260
into DNS it won't work and so if you can
gather an awful lot of DNS material

57
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,349
thing you can find out an awful lot
about what the bad people did in order

58
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:18,870
to create the infrastructure for various
attacks and show you some of that now if

59
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,590
you look at all of the DNS traffic that
comes in or system and it is over

60
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:30,799
200,000 events per second coming from a
global network of over 500 servers and

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,669
it is a difficult programming problem
I'm not saying that the people at Google

62
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,599
where people have Transpo card
processing data of that magnitude

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,880
trivially at this stage with when they
first started it was hard and when we

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,070
started it was hard and most of its junk
most of it is duplicative a lot of it is

65
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,840
Dennis tunnels lot of it is just stuff
the gym that won't help you at all look

66
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,799
at it and so we have had to come up with
various ways to filter down reduce the

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,240
volume increase the signal increase the
value and one of the things that we've

68
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,450
done is to tune out the old invariant
stuff look for certain patterns like ok

69
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,990
I've never seen this domain name before
you know it is

70
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,440
is it is in dot com it's it's a new.com
name I wonder if it was just created

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,200
right now or if maybe it's existed for a
while and I'm just seeing it for the

72
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,450
first time this type of filtering is
absolutely necessary and in the security

73
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,909
information exchange which is one of the
things that I said is available either

74
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,170
commercial or noncommercial depending on
who you are I see some customers in the

75
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,830
audience we have different channels for
different versions of that data so

76
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,510
certainly anybody who wants the 200,000
per second

77
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,260
you know it's it's available but it's
hard and we let people know that as hard

78
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:06,700
as I mentioned that there's a lot of
personally identifiable information in

79
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,370
the DNS so whatever drawn here is the
standard three-level model of how DNS

80
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,370
works this laptop is representative of
the bottom of this model this is this

81
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,310
would be a stub resolver it is making
queries of recursive servers probably

82
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,170
somewhere in this building that are
connected through the door part of the

83
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,800
service of this wireless internet when
it makes those queries that is

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,300
personally identifiable information
because somewhere in the infrastructure

85
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,700
there's a binding between the MAC
address that's a 48 mid Internet address

86
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,520
that this thing uses when it talks on a
wireless and the IP address and later

87
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,440
somewhere in the NetFlow there's going
to be a binding between what that IP

88
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,300
address when contacted and so if let's
say this was used to surf the web surf

89
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,750
some dirt part of the web that was
illegal in this country it is possible

90
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,670
through the use of subpoena power and so
forth for somebody to ultimately

91
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,440
determine that you were probably the one
who did certain things because you were

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,060
the one who owned the laptop at the MAC
address you got the IP address you did

93
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,590
the lookups so I don't like that so
further up that church you see the

94
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:31,440
recursive servers they have a cash and
cash is the reason the DNS is scaled was

95
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,159
originally an academic toy but it's now
serving two billion users and it has

96
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,770
designed hasn't changed much and the
reason is that if you would if this

97
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,360
laptop asks for something that has been
seen recently if somebody else's asked

98
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,100
for in recent hours that's going to come
out of the cash and so all the popular

99
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,430
names tend to get cash everywhere and
then the unpopular stuff the rarely

100
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,849
looked up stuff goes further that's
where workers Observer has what we call

101
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,130
a cache miss a nice to go up to the
authorities servers were content is

102
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,680
injected into the DNS in order to get
the answers would then go into the cash

103
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,390
and then go back to the studs we put our
some serb of the rigors of because I

104
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:19,520
don't want to know the IP address of the
person who did look up not every passive

105
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,130
DNS collector does this and if you are
using a recursive name server somewhere

106
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,380
that is not yours if you're not the
operator of this thing in the middle

107
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,780
you need to worry about what they're
doing with their query logs because they

108
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,420
know what you did so a lot of perfectly
good free software that will perform

109
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,060
that recursive DNS function for you I
wrote some of it called bond with their

110
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,599
power DNS there's been a lot of very
good software if you're not sure who's

111
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,620
looking at your traffic you probably
should be running your own recursive

112
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:01,720
name server rather than using Google's
or OpenDNS or your ISP's so I'm not in

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,970
the surveillance business I have more
data than anybody as far as I know but I

114
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,970
it's not attached to any end users I
like to help with investigations I like

115
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,020
to enhance investigations but I don't
like to be the place where they start

116
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:21,140
one of the really hot buttons about any
internet security person would be online

117
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,590
child abuse materials

118
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:29,560
you know sometimes called child
pornography if I was in possession of

119
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,229
information about who had looked up a
name that I knew was associated with

120
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,240
that I might even have disclosure
obligations to my own local police

121
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,180
department I don't want that not that i
dont wanna stop that from happening I

122
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,099
just don't want to be at that point in
the loop

123
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,209
rather be the place where you can find
out where those demands were served so

124
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,479
that you can go to enhance an
investigation but again I am NOT going

125
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,810
to help start them so upset about that
except to just try to drive home every

126
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,849
time I talk to a new sensor operator to
get my network extended I have this

127
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,899
conversation to let people know I won't
know what your customers did what your

128
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,649
employees did what your family didn't
know any of that because we're looking

129
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:19,870
above and all that information is below
so distressed details were just said

130
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,519
that there's other information also that
we have to filter out upstream for

131
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,649
example if you have a local network but
is using that and certainly any mid to

132
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,730
large company has a good chance of
having some servers inside your network

133
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,230
that don't have globally unique
addresses there in network tender there

134
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,860
in network 192 168 whenever and if you
were returning information about that

135
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,189
network through your recursive server
you probably don't want it in my

136
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:52,399
database you probably don't want me to
analyze it that would be information

137
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,850
about internal business prior practices
are internal technology policies so we

138
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,250
filter that out in the field in the
sensor itself but then we filter out

139
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,920
quite a bit more of a day after we
receive the data in the center which is

140
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,620
what I call the security information
exchange so inevitably there is some PRI

141
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,160
of it isn't your IP address is what I'm
saying and then also has to get filtered

142
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,600
out so to the extent that you're
participating in any passive DNS project

143
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,529
or that you think your recursive name
server might be doing check that so

144
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:38,089
most new domain names or useless their
malicious they are created by somebody

145
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:43,129
who has the purpose of either committing
a crime or spamming people are annoying

146
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:49,259
them in some way I will tell you now
that I have watched the stream of newly

147
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,449
observed domain names we take that
200,000 events per second and boil it

148
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:57,339
down to things that are legitimately new
over the six-year history of our

149
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,029
database and it's about one new
delegation per second it's bursting so

150
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,269
it's about fifty thousand a day to
86,000 seconds in a day so it works out

151
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:11,889
to about one per second over the long
run half of them are five-letter randa

152
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:18,110
five random letters top TK which is the
total islands this is a URL shortener

153
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,579
for spammers like bit ly for spammers

154
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:27,219
you know I'm not sure why we built a
global Internet in order to help those

155
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:33,139
people do those things but they are a
lot of the rest of it though is not any

156
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:39,059
more useful than is just stuff that was
created in order to 42 to make a certain

157
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:44,740
phishing attack work so it might have
some well-known brand name in the middle

158
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,620
of the domain name somewhere and it's
just created for the purpose of sending

159
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,059
too much spam trying to get people to
click on something that maybe they think

160
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:56,809
is their banker their grocery store
whatever and then credential theft and

161
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:02,290
then poof the domains gone well as to
these things really we could live

162
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,389
without their there might be a million
new domain names per year that the

163
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,230
internet legitimate Lee needs in order
to facilitate communication between

164
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,540
parties who want to communicate with
each other and the rest is for people

165
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,420
who want to communicate with me that I
don't want to communicate with

166
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,199
background so it's unilateral service
and you see me at the bar later I'll

167
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,128
tell you things I think we could do to
to make that better but right now let's

168
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:33,260
focus on the analysis

169
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:41,230
an awful lot of the block lists or IP
blacklist server network reputation

170
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,760
systems actually started the first
antispam company called maps and GPS

171
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,170
back in the nineties which we later sold
to pay our lawyers because it turned out

172
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,900
sending spam was not illegal but
stopping it was an antitrust violation

173
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,949
so learning the hard way but there's an
awful lot of reputation services out

174
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,520
there Spamhaus is probably the best
known and everybody is using them and

175
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,160
when you see those queries in your query
string you probably don't want to save

176
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:17,839
those either but as criminals create
resources they may get their hands on

177
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,850
some IP address space or they create
some domain names and then they create

178
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,340
some findings in DNS between those names
in those numbers various providers like

179
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,220
Spamhaus are gonna discover this they're
gonna see spam

180
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,540
they're gonna see other than to get
complaints and because we now know that

181
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,480
who is garbage can't complain to the
person who purports to own the domain

182
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,600
you'll pretty much have to stop it
yourself you know you can't stop it from

183
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,100
coming into the internet at the far end
you have to stop it from getting out of

184
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,370
the internet at your near and we do that
with network reputation systems this is

185
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:02,620
not the most efficient way to build a
global internet but it is just don't

186
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,460
hate the player hate the game so as we
kill more stuff they will create more

187
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,250
stuff that there is not some critical
point above which if we just kill off

188
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,590
enough of their infrastructure though
give up and decide to get real jobs we

189
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,330
have we have to be prepared for endless
escalation along this track is why we

190
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,449
say a lather rinse repeat

191
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:31,959
hurricane here

192
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:39,368
DNS if you're just looking at your part
of it that you're creating a vanity name

193
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,319
you might have dub dub dub dub Baltic
Sea don't order something like that it

194
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,519
looks like the picture on the right
words it's it's a big place but it's

195
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,439
mostly static and that's not true as you
sit in the middle of it and watch what

196
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,089
people are looking up which is where we
are it looks much more like the picture

197
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:01,519
on the left there's just a huge amount
of material flying around all the time

198
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,419
let me give you an example of what I
mean by that we're seeing somewhere

199
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:16,059
between 150 and 300 newly observed
hostnames per second the delegation

200
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,668
points and it told you about earlier
like name.com and talking about so

201
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:29,299
domain.com and that means that out there
in the internet host names are being

202
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,460
added to rate of hundreds per second

203
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,730
no I don't think we're adding hosts at
that speed I think most of these names

204
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,169
point to things that are not real hosts
and I'll get into that moment but if you

205
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:46,190
look at the other view which is how many
DNS changes are we seen in other words

206
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,779
this name in this type like dub dub dub
done example.com would be a name would

207
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,889
be a time for Andres has this name and
type pointed out something differently

208
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:01,760
before this this moment in other words
I'm I seen a change at delta in the DNS

209
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,389
well we're seeing even more of those
then we see of new host names and I

210
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:10,418
don't think that that represents the
actual churn of Internet infrastructure

211
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:16,440
being added and remembered and changed I
just realized two billion users regard

212
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,320
ISPs in every country and so forth I
just don't think this represents real

213
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,020
stuff and I'm I was right

214
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:37,250
so I have a movie which I'm hoping this
is a debug trace protocol trace of the

215
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,140
new observed them in general are new
leader postname channel so this is

216
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,360
trying to keep up with a three hundred
or so record per second output rate

217
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,939
obviously it's not succeeding but you
get the idea that staring at this would

218
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,740
give you know where you really have to
be prepared to watch this with software

219
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,890
rather than with humanize

220
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,760
caution you against putting it in a
database and then running queries

221
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,790
against it I realized that Big Data
makes that possible but that doesn't

222
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:19,980
make it useful so we use a continuous
processing model we don't treat security

223
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,350
information lives particles we treated
as waves and so everything I've

224
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,860
described to you so far except that
six-year historical database six years

225
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,580
and growing is done in RAM and we have
just a long string of pearls we're

226
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,220
certainly little Linux blades and limits
when you servers in Iraq somewhere

227
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,250
continue to receive the raw data break
it down further

228
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,280
yet the cooks data from the guy upstream
of them korean break it down further and

229
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,480
so forth

230
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,770
I don't know of another way to process
data at this volume except to do this

231
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,620
certainly if we had had the idea that we
would put everything in a database and

232
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,429
then from the database create the
outputs that we've seen I would have

233
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:10,080
nothing to show your day so you know i i
am just barely old enough to remember

234
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,379
punch cards and green bar paper and that
is how data processing worked in those

235
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,700
days you put everything in a database
and your inquiries against it and again

236
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,450
makes that possible but that doesn't
make it useful so please as you consider

237
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,430
how you're going to process your own
syslog trials for example think about

238
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,700
how to grab everything that's happened
recently remember the important parts of

239
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,830
what's happened recently in then
basically treated as I don't know

240
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,879
hurricane with puzzle pieces from flying
through the air and if you grab a piece

241
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,690
that happens to fit another piece in
your hand then you're making progress

242
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,320
don't wait for the hurricane and then at
the end of the day see what you got

243
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,860
so the struggle but newly observed
demands and hostnames obviously all host

244
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,899
names are domains so we're stuck with
some bad technical terms here for

245
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,310
marketing reasons our first channel was
called new injured domains by which I

246
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:17,770
mean delegation points for example in NL
it's possible I think for people to

247
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,639
register names directly under the
country codes you could get all of

248
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
exceed and only here and that would be a
delegation point but if I create host

249
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,710
names at my house like server one
observer to dot Baltic Sea . and all

250
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,640
those are not delegation points so
anyway

251
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,960
bear with me I'm sorry for butchering
the terminology but we call that the

252
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,890
longer things host names and the shorter
things domains even though it's really

253
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,560
the longer things are domains in the
shorter things are delegation points

254
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,560
right so we observe demands for new
observed delegation points look like

255
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,679
this in our data scope obviously its
binary data on the wire and so what

256
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,490
you're seeing here is the domain we
discovered the delegation point we

257
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,050
discovered and when you're looking into
the region the DNS transaction that

258
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,520
caused us to discover it and in this
case the resource record name was the

259
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,540
same as the delegation point that this
is this shows us no longer names but it

260
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,670
does in this case tell us what the name
servers were for a delegation point that

261
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:25,300
is potentially useful information if you
have some idea that other things that

262
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,500
have pointed at the same nameservers
turned out to be evil maybe this is evil

263
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,470
to you know that's the kind of thing
that you have to kind of thinking that

264
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:39,270
goes into the continuous process and in
describing anyway we're not saying that

265
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,580
all new demands are bad I happen to know
that that's true but that's not what we

266
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,240
say what we say is nearly 20 mins newly
observed demands deserve

267
00:22:48,240 --> 00:23:02,780
have extra scrutiny good so welcome to
come to that later here are some demands

268
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,428
that we saw we took a twenty-four hour
snapshot of our newly observed I mean

269
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,740
channel we just looked around for people
and some other fairly well known brand

270
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,500
names and we found that people get used
a lot and if you look at the bottom 100

271
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,210
people update information I D mumble
mumble it was clearly part of a phishing

272
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,940
attack that was where somebody got some
targeted email that said PayPal can't

273
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,160
reach you until you go and correct your
information please login by clicking

274
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,330
here and if you're not an information
security professional you gonna look at

275
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,520
that and say oh PayPal update you click
on that it's sad that we had to build

276
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,250
the whole human economy with monkey DNA
but that's what we are willing to click

277
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,950
on things

278
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,530
PayPal accounts all.com and so forth

279
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:00,620
I'm using PayPal's my example obviously
there are thousands of brands that are

280
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,489
abused in this way but to be
successfully abused in this way you have

281
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,679
to have some idea that people really are
likely to be customers of it right if

282
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,570
you get this email and you are not
people user you're gonna you're going to

283
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,450
know what's false so you won't see
things were grocery store however make

284
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,240
sure beer but you will see your bank and
you will see who your cable TV company

285
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:31,890
and so forth but a lot of the in those
examples you see the lot of the branding

286
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,590
violations were not at the top level
right so then the second one for example

287
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:43,480
account check PayPal account check paper
held up pick whatever don't come pick or

288
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,990
pmdd come is what shows up as a newly
observed delegation point but the longer

289
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,390
name is what you what actually is used
to carrying the militias information

290
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,150
which is the the branding solution and
that's why we have a second channel that

291
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,570
second channel is going a lot higher
volumes hundreds per second as opposed

292
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,659
to one or two per second

293
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,850
here's one of the observed first name
looks like so it's very similar schema

294
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,800
and you see the domain name that we
pulled out of it but you can also see

295
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:21,428
that they are named had this pile of
junk . the the delegation point and I'm

296
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:27,730
not gonna try and say that word you can
whatever but it's a real words in the

297
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:35,809
dictionary and the its interests I don't
have no idea how they come up with this

298
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,730
stuff

299
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,530
perhaps they have a dictionary that
feeds them names but we did some deeper

300
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:48,040
checking on that wanted to say right
what is this and who is was useless so

301
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:55,020
we went deeper into it said that was a
CNAME CNAME is an alias in the DNS that

302
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,590
means if you look up the our name you're
going to get redirected to the thing at

303
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,260
the bottom there called the our data so
let's take a look at our data front

304
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,400
instead secret media dot com that
doesn't sound safe to me that sounds

305
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:15,910
like something you might want to avoid
so we get around on their website

306
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,690
learned almost nothing except the Wall
Street Journal's had an article about

307
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,210
them being an advertiser who is pretty
good at evading at blocking and turns

308
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,010
out that's what this is for which is
that these are the names that appear in

309
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,710
the website and saw your ad blocker
would have to know every one of those

310
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,669
random gibberish things . this
unpronounceable second level name in

311
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,770
order to know that this was an ad
because the ad blocker doesn't get a

312
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,940
chance to see what the CNAME points to
know that the CNAME should be poisoned

313
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,850
in anything that points to it should be
poisoned so it's a layering problem with

314
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,850
that is kind of a loophole in the way of
blogging happens I'm giving you can

315
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,020
expect to see a lot more of this and
then the web browser people will catch

316
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,658
up and actually exposed the CNAME to the
ad blocker plugin in order to to close

317
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:11,720
this loophole so yes this is it's just
random crowd

318
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:18,250
we looked around to see if there was any
pattern to it there there there was a

319
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,950
little bit of a pattern to it but not
enough that you could hook onto it with

320
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,280
some algorithmic plugin you really have
to know what is what seemed at points to

321
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,720
if you're going to discover that this is
something that a blogger should should

322
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,409
grab but we also looked for me since we
have a database to go back six years we

323
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:42,100
looked in center and can we just find
all of the other things that have

324
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,610
appeared in the last week that we're
seeing aims to that same place we found

325
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,979
seven hundred thousand of them it shared
this particular unpronounceable second

326
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,830
level name but then we found a whole
bunch of other interesting stuff atomic

327
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:07,110
power seductress now I want to go there
so we have drilled down on a single

328
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,360
example but you understand that in the
24 hour sample we took there was a

329
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,280
hurricane of similar wreckage

330
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,370
if you want to protect yourself from all
of that you're going to need to spend

331
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,539
some time contemplating that hurricane
and deciding what it means to you and

332
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,480
what what it means to you in terms of
policy that you might want to have

333
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:36,330
toward these new names or policy you
might want to have toured domain names

334
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,158
that have this type of structure of this
type of pattern like being a whole bunch

335
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,360
of different things all seen him into
the same place that could be something

336
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,850
you just decide it's got that many see
names I don't want to go there no matter

337
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:58,360
what it points to ok I do want to say we
in the security industry are clearly all

338
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,760
trying to do well by doing good right we
want to get paid for doing meaningful

339
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,250
work and a lot of the meaningful work
involves two defense it involves

340
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,720
figuring out what the criminals are
doing now or what they're going to do

341
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,080
next to them helping our customers avoid

342
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,389
damages from from those actions and
that's all good but we need to do more

343
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,130
because this to me what I shown you so
far

344
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:32,669
signals a structural defect in Internet
Governance itself right the DNS is not

345
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:37,399
was not created by a company owned by a
company called a lot of companies behave

346
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:44,979
that way it is so we create the danis
every day by making queries into it by

347
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,610
putting our content into it and we need
to take a look at how it's being used

348
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,699
and how it's being governed and see if
maybe

349
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,370
changes to the way domain names are
registered changes to the way who is

350
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:05,469
handled changes somehow to the way
criminals are allowed to use this could

351
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,130
maybe save some of us some money rather
than having this endless cat-and-mouse

352
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:17,960
escalation by my DNS changes so far I've
told you about newly observed delegation

353
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,080
points and newly observed fully
qualified names and that's interesting

354
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,439
but we decided to look deeper and since
we're seeing somewhere between half and

355
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,850
two-thirds of is my estimate of how much
of the DNS we can see from where we are

356
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:42,459
it becomes interesting to look at the
Delta again these are changes where you

357
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,110
had a certain name in a type that
pointed to a certain value up until now

358
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,918
10 points at something else will what is
responsible for that change it could for

359
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,789
example have been something we call fast
flux which is a way of evading take down

360
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,190
it could be that somebody had a
legitimate renumber an event they had a

361
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,850
server then needed to move it to a
different subnet they give it a

362
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,699
different address and that shows up as a
change how do you tell the difference

363
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,710
well let me give you some examples so
this is a one record snapshot from

364
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,059
channel 249 the security information
exchange and see the timestamp you can

365
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:26,940
see it's a new domain record seed Li
tutsi see was the name and here you can

366
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,420
see we've got those 51 areas of the body

367
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,340
I'm telling us it's not a new deal
mainly food or about the domain name for

368
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,540
a while we know about the art this are
named for a while and we note about this

369
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,580
army man tied together for a while but
we've never seen this are are associated

370
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,760
with it before and so that means that
the are set the set of borrowers

371
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,000
associated with it is also a new so that
address becomes interesting 2009 at 126

372
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,100
$2.99 at 2:31 wasn't previously pointed
to by this so it's gotta have some kind

373
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,480
of service on it now services are very
lightweight lot of IOT devices are

374
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,840
actually servers even though they cost a
nickel so I don't want to make servers

375
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,889
sound like they're heavyweight expense
of objects but still the existence of a

376
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:21,640
new one can be for good purposes or bad
and in this case it was bad

377
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:31,990
through this year was an interesting
example we have differing this by

378
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:39,540
replacing the actual ASCII . characters
with bracket because this is something

379
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,760
that virus total vote that's one of the
virus total told us is a current example

380
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,550
there is actually a virus which is new
enough that it's infected a lot of

381
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,210
people that is generating queries like
this with you generate queries like

382
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:01,480
those you could expect a phone call from
your ISP perhaps so in this case we had

383
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,680
this random looking name that had an
address

384
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:14,130
8885 dotty dot 170 and there is stuff
posted there that you do not want to be

385
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:19,360
caught fishing and so this is criminal
stalking other criminals in this case

386
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:28,219
this is not malicious software so much
as malicious content and the what made

387
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,210
their address interesting is that it was
suddenly pointed to buy something and it

388
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:39,070
had not been pointed to before now so I
think every new address needs to get

389
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,950
scrutinized every new name needs to get
scrutinized it's sad

390
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,409
that that's true I wish that Internet
Governance worked a little bit better so

391
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:51,320
that we didn't have the indy five
percent or more of the new content on

392
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:58,059
the internet being malicious in some way
but given that that is the situation I

393
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:02,879
think we all have to start saying that
if its new it deserves scrutiny and all

394
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:12,500
of our research supports that accept
this content delivery network they

395
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:19,119
specialize in hosting content for people
become globally available it's available

396
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,510
in every country they serve it with low
round trip times low latency high

397
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,000
bandwidth and so on there there is one
of the first really successful companies

398
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,190
that does this but they do it in DNS and
show almost every answer they give is

399
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:39,550
tailored for the particular user who
asked the question which means that it

400
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,550
looks new and different but it isn't
it's actually it means the same thing

401
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,940
it's just pointing different domain
names into different parts of their

402
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,530
global infrastructure and so as you
start processing things and you say

403
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,369
cocaine these new bindings these new
names are new addresses are unknown

404
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:00,099
binding between a name and address
deserve scrutiny one of the first things

405
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,960
you're going to do is wait lists all of
the CD ants and yes that'll make you

406
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,770
blind to malicious content that is
hosted there but Akamai at least has a

407
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,410
very active abuse department they take
down the bad content fast enough that

408
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,000
you don't need to worry about them being
used as a loophole against you but we

409
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,160
have to wait list because they're
responsible not Akamai itself but about

410
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,240
half of the 300 pence per second that
we're seeing in our excuse me $600 per

411
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,149
second that we're seeing are some
seating area somewhere and you know you

412
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,540
don't waste your investigatory powers on
stuff that is probably not trying to

413
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,540
hurt you so ideally oil filter it out
down through global

414
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,390
noise level that you can actually spend
a little bit of energy looking at

415
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:54,100
everything that comes out the far end of
your of your deepest filter ok I'm

416
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:04,960
rushing through this twenty minutes left
ok so we decided I think I mentioned

417
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,520
earlier that we did a 24 hour snapshot
and when we gone deep on a couple of the

418
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,820
things we found in a 24 hour period and
then let me tell you the characteristics

419
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:21,930
of the full 24 hours we ended up with 29
million changes that we're seeing in a

420
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,529
24 hour period and you can see the
normal diurnal pattern so you can figure

421
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:32,500
out from this exactly which
industrialized nations were awake and

422
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:39,270
using facebook or or whatever different
times but my god that's a lot of changes

423
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:47,040
so these new delegation points apiece
domains were interesting in this case

424
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,820
told you it's normally one per second
here it's about two per second train

425
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,180
there's 86,000 seconds in a day here we
saw about twice that number of new

426
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,509
delegation points created raise your
hand right now if you think that that

427
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:07,100
looks good content got added to the
internet during that time so clearly

428
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,660
this is this means that dennis is a good
business to be in I guess Verisign and

429
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,240
NuStar and all the various top level
domain registries and go down in the

430
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,359
other large volume registrars know that
but I'm sort of letting you know that

431
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,660
there is a huge market for creating the
stuff there are discounts there are ways

432
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,899
to get them for close to nothing since
we are rejecting emails that has started

433
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,580
quads in the body of our messages we've
taught the spammers that they need new

434
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,090
domain names for almost every message
they sound and so the industry has

435
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:49,130
responded by learning how to create
domain names at that speed and at a

436
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,890
price point that spammers can afford so

437
00:37:53,890 --> 00:38:03,240
so Verisign had a different estimate
which I thought was interesting they

438
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:10,859
thought that dot net had grown about
one-third as much as what we saw net

439
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,290
which they would they were looking at
the domain name to find out how many

440
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:19,610
names they had seen created during a
year and our estimate is that there

441
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:24,560
should be about 64 million of them
there's was a lot smaller so it turns

442
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,210
out that they don't use the PSL

443
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,820
so the public public suffix list was
created by the browser community in

444
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,330
order to figure out what the the top
level of a cookie should be so if

445
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,980
somebody tries to give you a cookie for
calm hoping that you use you allow

446
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,440
anything ending in.com access to the the
DOM for for that web page and so forth

447
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,540
that's a cross site scripting
vulnerability so the PSL is just a

448
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,050
ham-handed coarse-grained filter to try
and keep that from happening but it also

449
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:02,400
helps us to determine what is and is not
a delegation point so for example it

450
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,410
isn't always a second level name in the
UK delegation point will tend to be

451
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:15,040
under . CEO dot UK which is their
version of dot com and so the simplistic

452
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,660
way of thinking about it where you would
say anything that is at the second level

453
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,180
is probably in television point won't
work around the world there are some

454
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,549
things even longer than that if you look
at some of the dynamic dns providers

455
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,580
where they are effectively a TLD in the
sense that you can buy subdomains of

456
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,410
something but it might be a third or
fourth level named by the time you're

457
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,549
done paying for it so you really need to
be looking at the PSL and we love her

458
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,210
friends to various I know that their
report was wrong because they had not

459
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:52,950
done so we saw seven million newly
observed long names in that same period

460
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:02,210
and those who make seven million of what
we saw here knew our names it if you

461
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,970
extrapolate this we're looking

462
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:09,770
almost three billion new fully qualified
names per second per year and I wish

463
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,849
that was wrong

464
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:15,280
most of these are short lived which is
why the DNS doesn't grow without bounds

465
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,060
and then explore because of the laws of
thermodynamics most of these things are

466
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,369
taken down because they are criminal or
their abandoned after they have been

467
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:26,470
abused and then they don't get paid for
so they didn't look at this stuff

468
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:32,859
disappears mostly in the same week that
it's created but we also want to take a

469
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:39,660
look at data types of all the changes
all the things that we're knew where was

470
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,920
most of the change and here when you
look at SOE changes this does not

471
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,630
include serial number changes this was
something else about it so I and what is

472
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,030
mostly was was a new as a way that we
haven't seen before so it is a start of

473
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,020
authority Institute thing at the top of
a zone that tells you how to tell us

474
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,759
administrators and other name servers
had a handle that so obviously a records

475
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,680
ipv4 was the big winner interestingly we
had almost a third of a percent of our

476
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:16,368
sample was ipv6 that is better than
we've ever seen so that I don't mean I

477
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:20,609
don't wanna say that that gives me hope
that 36 could take off some day but at

478
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:30,290
least it's not dead yet and we have the
equivalent of high-frequency trading

479
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:35,369
here and I'm not gonna

480
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:38,520
I'm gonna run at a time if I go through
this in detail so I'm not going to do

481
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,130
that and i mentioned CD announce
location dependent dancers the study is

482
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,640
worth reading and if you like these
slides and you want to see more we

483
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,490
actually have a longer technical paper
about this on our website for security

484
00:41:53,490 --> 00:42:02,479
dot com and again you can see Akamai
dominates so we we will ultimately come

485
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,300
up with a secondary channel that takes
the changes channel and simply filters

486
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,710
out all the CDM stuff in order to create
a lower volume higher signal higher

487
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,619
value channel

488
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,650
so that people who want to do this type
of analysis will have a starting point

489
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:24,109
that isn't full of all those could which
really is it's the one of the things we

490
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:28,328
do the most often when doing the type of
waterfall or continuous process and then

491
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,980
I'm describing is reduced filtering
stuff out and trained make a fair value

492
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,670
of derivative of the channels and the
raw data which is it's both a fire hose

493
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:44,789
in volume and its deluge in terms of the
number of different particle types so I

494
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:52,569
am gonna just skip a lot of this because
it's just too would take way too long

495
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:58,170
programmatic name generation you've
probably all heard of demand generation

496
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:04,999
algorithm that's on Flickr was a famous
one back in 2008 2009 the idea of a DGA

497
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:10,240
botnet is that if you want to infect a
bunch of computers with software that is

498
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,930
going to contact you

499
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,210
the bad guy to get its instructions like
you should I did officer who should I

500
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:21,210
spam you know what would you like me to
do and I'll get it taken over this end

501
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:26,680
user's computer you have the problem of
if you use a domain name then it's very

502
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,680
possible that the law enforcement will
come to your house and take all your

503
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,149
stuff so what you do is you don't use a
static name in the case of conflict or I

504
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,220
don't know exactly what this was born in
case your contractor was done based on

505
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:48,788
the day and so they ultimately would
start a random number generator a

506
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:55,339
pseudo-random number generator using by
seeding it with the day of year and the

507
00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:00,880
year so on any given day it would be
trying fifty thousand names that we're

508
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,309
somewhat unique to that day there were
not good math people so there was a lot

509
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:10,680
of collisions on the same name that used
on more than one day they were slobs

510
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,769
compared to the guys that do it today
but you know it's been six or seven

511
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:18,390
years and what that means is that the
bad guy has an opportunity especially

512
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,799
since these names were split over a
hundred and sixteen different effective

513
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:24,190
to oldies which were in

514
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,210
hundred and ten different till the is
and some of those TLD is where small

515
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,460
island nations that don't exactly have a
large security team that is ready to

516
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,140
block this stuff what that means is that
if the bad guy decides that on a certain

517
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,740
day he wants to actually command the
botnet what he has to do is register one

518
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,169
of the fifty thousand names it's going
to use and if you can register it and

519
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,420
get contacted by his box faster than we
can notice that he's registered it and

520
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,599
take it down then he will have signaled
a botnet to go do something potentially

521
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,460
damaging it was the largest botnet I had
heard of at the time its contractor had

522
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,300
11 million unique IDs per day coming
into our sinkhole there are bigger ones

523
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,869
narrow but it was him but contractor
itself is only shrunk down to about 2

524
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:15,890
million a day there's still a million
and it's been seven years might indicate

525
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,770
that we don't care as much about DGA as
as as we as I think we should anyway

526
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:29,099
there's notify get notified 869 are you
is not a DGA so actually way off topic

527
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:35,460
here this is Ben in the Spamhaus
blacklist for quite some time we're not

528
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,950
totally sure what these names are but we
know they're programmatically generated

529
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:54,640
and I'm gonna just we're down to our
last 15 minutes here so i'm ok here we

530
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,690
reversed

531
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:01,940
and we change the dots who the bracket .
and so you can see that PayPal appears

532
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,920
sometimes at the end sometimes in the
middle of labels sometimes as a label in

533
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,849
the middle of a domain name sometimes
misspelled with two else this is the

534
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:17,560
kind of thing that bad guys are doing
you know I am NOT going to say who is or

535
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,109
is not our customer but I will say that
we we do sell this to some commercial

536
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:25,200
people who want to do brand protection
order for themselves or for their

537
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,020
customers and this is the kind of thing
that you guys will need to be doing at

538
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,310
some level whether you pay somebody else
to do it or whether you decide you're

539
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,920
going to do it yourself you need to be
paying attention to the way that your

540
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:50,470
trusted more marks are being used online
far from your network ok so I started

541
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:55,598
this company thank you started this
project as part of a non-profit company

542
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:02,000
I used to work out internet systems
consortium in 2007 I took it private and

543
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,670
made it into a commercial entity in 2013
because I was capital constrained it was

544
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,940
not that I was not paid well enough it's
Anna could not by enough equipment to

545
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:16,530
hire enough people to do the job and
went to serve to be done I'm trying to

546
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:21,300
increase the observability of the
internet trend have a deal it instead of

547
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,540
every security company coming up the
gate and setting up whatever sensors

548
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,089
they can set up and then building
fortresses around those sensors to keep

549
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:35,069
their competitors from being able to see
the same things because ultimately

550
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:40,500
competition was how you win customers
build revenue and so you're company is

551
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,440
one of the structural defects that I
talked about it is something we do wrong

552
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,720
that helps the bad guys

553
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,089
honest-to-god there are some of these
cease operating on Sand Hill Road in

554
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:57,509
Palo Alto and Menlo Park not far from my
house that specialize in creating new

555
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,150
security companies and then

556
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,030
running them in the traditional Harvard
MBA style of building boats around every

557
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:07,610
one of them and if I were a bad guy I
would put tens or even hundreds of

558
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:13,090
millions of dollars into that company's
funds because they helped me so much if

559
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:18,740
I'm a bad guy we just can't we can't
overlook this we can't pretend that this

560
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,990
could happen against our will we have to
be complacent and we have to be

561
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:29,839
complicit in order for things to get
this bad this fast so that's why we

562
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,020
started this that's why I'm growing it
commercially that's why we make this

563
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:39,150
data available both commercially and and
on commercially I want everybody to know

564
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,860
what's going on so that they can all
either do something about it for

565
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:46,600
themselves do something about it maybe
as part of a internet superhero

566
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:52,549
nighttime project maybe do something
about it for their customers but also so

567
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,350
that we can all be jointly aware of how
bad it is so that we might be able to

568
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:02,930
put some pressure on Internet Governance
to get the systemic defects fixed at

569
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,680
that level as well

570
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:10,500
whois privacy is just a travesty i I
cannot find a defense of that or let's

571
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:17,630
take another example when I was a kid I
dot com name took two or three days to

572
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:22,710
create because they don't come zone was
only generated twice a week and so if

573
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,600
it's generated on Tuesdays and Fridays
and you created on Tuesday you might get

574
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,540
it in that day a few critter Wednesday
or wait till Friday that seem reasonable

575
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,000
to me because I gotta say nobody no team
anywhere

576
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,420
spends months developing content
developing an idea for a new business

577
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,670
and then gets to the day of the launch
and says oh my god I forgot to register

578
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:51,350
the domain name for now because they had
a race to the bottom right . bills and

579
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:56,410
done in phone not separately then
ordered people all came in and said we

580
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,200
gotta find a way to distinguish
ourselves from Verisign well they're

581
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,950
only publishing twice a week where we
can publish every day Verisign looked at

582
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,750
that and said I think we could do it
every hour

583
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,730
somebody else so I think we could do it
every 10 minutes and somebody else oh no

584
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,340
I think we could

585
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,600
every five minutes eventually then race
to the bottom and you hit the bottom and

586
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,580
turns out the speed the photo and only
travel through fiber at a certain fixed

587
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:26,310
maximum rate and so by the time Liard
unsettling and done getting all of your

588
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:31,420
servers about 30 seconds has gone by and
so that's why thirty seconds is the

589
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:37,390
reference standard now for creating a
new generic delegation point but can

590
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:43,390
anybody tell me please what the non
criminal purposes of a thirty second

591
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,609
turn around for a new domain name
because when I needed one for let's say

592
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:51,370
for site security not come you know
anytime that month would have been fine

593
00:50:51,370 --> 00:51:00,200
so because of these new channels you
gonna watch all kinds of stuff you

594
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,290
couldn't watch before we have one
channel that pulls out just the annexed

595
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:09,200
domains and that means that if we've got
academic teams out there who were doing

596
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,939
DGA research where they're trying to
reverse the reverse engineer the

597
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,860
algorithm that creates these names and
then they're sort of looking for you

598
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:25,070
know where who is patient zero what was
the first part of the world this name

599
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:30,030
god looked up in you know we actually
have enough data to inform that research

600
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:33,750
and their commercial prospects as well I
don't sound like I'm still in the

601
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:39,810
nonprofit world I just came from there
and then finally you know there's an

602
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:46,120
awful lot of weird stuff and some of it
you can discard on moscow you can come

603
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,759
up with simple techniques like oh it's
Akamai so I'm not going to look at that

604
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,520
others might require some serious
competition to figure out what you're

605
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,500
going to ignore and then cut the station
is a form of wisdom because it will

606
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,100
teach you

607
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,740
which parts of the internet or being
used in what way and again the internet

608
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,549
was not created by a company is owned by
a company the Internet as an illusion

609
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:13,650
that is made up by us who use it and
that's because we decide to follow the

610
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,760
protocol but our systems work and that's
because we all follow the same protocol

611
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,990
that other people can get work done and
can make money and can create new

612
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,379
companies and so forth

613
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:28,240
so somehow out of this group illusion
that we all jointly create we also need

614
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,419
to take the reins in hand we need to
decide what kind of an Internet we want

615
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,720
to create we're using our power
mindlessly we're creating an internet

616
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,080
that we don't like five minutes and I
hope that you're gonna fill them with

617
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,090
questions

618
00:52:44,090 --> 00:53:09,040
user

619
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:30,670
so technology has been trying to secure
DNS itself so we have transaction

620
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:36,030
signatures to protect zone transfers
against tampering of DNS sec to allow

621
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:42,330
crypto authenticity seek invalidate when
you receive something that I really was

622
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:47,200
generated by the owner of that domain
rather than a be inserted by some

623
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,200
advertiser in the middle maybe it's
supposed to be a negative answer but you

624
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,910
got a positive answer and you visit the
website and it is an ad that is related

625
00:53:55,910 --> 00:54:00,109
to the question you were asking there's
a lot of different kinds of poisoning

626
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:05,450
I'm not seeing the connection between
poisoning and who my service of Akamai

627
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:24,970
so can you restate that part of your
question

628
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,230
yes

629
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:38,119
ok so Pasadena system we go through five
or six stages between deduplication and

630
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:43,730
junk filtering and so forth as possible
and sure most of you know the to steal

631
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:50,160
wifi in a coffee shop by running a VPN
over DNS because they're paywall allows

632
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,129
DNS to work even before you paid the
money all of that stuff is trash that I

633
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,340
don't want to my database and who is
Mike worried that you described as on my

634
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,440
list of poison that is something that we
had to discover ultimately by looking

635
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,850
the the graph of names if if some if
there's a name that has too many

636
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:15,009
children we look at a human has to look
at it so calm as a hundred and thirty

637
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,810
million children at last count and it's
allowed to have that many children but

638
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,100
if it's some deeper thing and it's got
millions of children that's an

639
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,490
indication that we better study and that
it's probably something like what you're

640
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:32,830
describing in particular the video CD
and people are not as mature technically

641
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,990
as Akamai there are an awful lot of CDN
producers that there should be a video

642
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:48,319
CD ants that partner up with cable TV
companies they will have it be that if

643
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,130
you wanna watch a certain recorded TV
show pre-recorded TV show or

644
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,880
movie or something like that that will
send you a to a pay wall and then after

645
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,500
you enter your credit card or your
password or whatever it is you meander

646
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:06,400
they give you a CNAME to give us an
impact your browser so that your browser

647
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,490
will connect to the place that will
actually start the media stream and

648
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:17,129
that's seen a manned up encoding your
end user IP address in clear text plus

649
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:21,250
your region plus maybe your customer
number of sometimes your password it's

650
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:28,279
all in there so when we see that
somebody on my staff will start changing

651
00:56:28,279 --> 00:56:33,619
our filters so that we stopped recording
it we will schedule you know major

652
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:38,119
renovation of stored data from two years
ago to remove it from the permanent

653
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:43,380
record and we're getting on the phone to
that video CDN provider to to explore

654
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:48,279
with them the possible benefits to their
business of one-way hashing so that's

655
00:56:48,279 --> 00:57:06,840
what we do have one minute left any
other questions

656
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:12,500
so for the purpose of these slides we
didn't do anything fancy when you grow

657
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:19,950
up obviously the people that we sell
this feed to our professionals at this

658
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:25,410
and they're using sound effects and
other similar types of things such that

659
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:30,029
if it looks the same or sounds the same
one spoken they will treated as

660
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,520
suspicious and then they'll have a
scoring system and if they find enough

661
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,490
different reasons to treated as
suspicious they'll open it taken on

662
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:41,520
human eyes will go after it so you know
a true amateur system other than making

663
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,190
the slides for the presentation would
certainly want to say that if it's if it

664
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:49,840
would be Microsoft except that one would
have to be changed to an eye then you

665
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:56,190
want to treat that as Microsoft but we
didn't do that so that is something our

666
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:01,880
customers do in this case we're not in
the brand enforcement business we just

667
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,110
sell wholesale to other security
companies who have that is one of the

668
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:11,690
sidelines I am in 20 minutes so I'll be
in a hallway you can stay as long as you

669
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,890
want but I gotta get off the stage
before the hook comes thank you very

670
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:15,100
much
