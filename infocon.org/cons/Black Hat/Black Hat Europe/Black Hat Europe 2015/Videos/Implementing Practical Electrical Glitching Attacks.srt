1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
good morning thank you for coming to my
talk this is actually my first time ever

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,590
doing a talk and actually my first time
in Europe as well and today and we

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,340
talking to you about how to abuse
hardware to bypass software security

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:26,070
checks so I'm red color i've been a
security consultant for about almost two

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,770
years now and have an interest in harbor
attacks and hardware security so far

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,399
today we're going to be going over these
topics so I'm gonna start off by going

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,430
over to very high level what a literal
glitching attacks are and where they can

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:51,460
be used and quickly go over the reset
glitch hack on the Xbox 360 and from

9
00:00:51,460 --> 00:01:01,270
this attack are bringing to develop a
methodology to go use our

10
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:09,270
on more generalized devices as we will
see about head and then towards the end

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:18,100
of the devices I had in mind to go over
and try to attack and ideas for cooking

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,320
experiments in the future and finally
defenses that it renders can try to do

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,970
the defend themselves against these
types of attacks so the start off we

14
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,670
should ask what is a glittering attack
and a coaching attack is intentional

15
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:44,070
fault introduced to a device to
undermined its security and the effects

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,850
of these faults can include certain
actions such as destruction skipping

17
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,798
malformed data reads or writes
instruction decoding areas as well as

18
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:03,719
any sort of computational errors
introduced into a when this happens

19
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:11,620
attacks come in three flavors they come
in invasive and semi invasive

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,709
non-invasive and invasive and semi
invasive attacks required to perform

21
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:26,480
some sort of modifications to the D
packaging on icy and oftentimes requires

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,518
a lot of time and some fairly expensive
equipment whereas with non-invasive

23
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,989
attacks we don't really have to do much
modification to the target device and

24
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,900
could be done on the cheap

25
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:53,959
these also are quite simple to implement
as we all say later on in the TOC so

26
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,810
with non-invasive types of attacks that
we have we can do electrical attacks

27
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,290
thermo or radiation attacks and the
scope of this talk is only gonna really

28
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,260
cover the electrical tax which include
the clock and power switching variants

29
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,200
so with a clock watching attack we have
introduced on plan clock edges into the

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,119
target I see and we can use different
types of signals when we are doing this

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,819
type of attack so if you look at the
glittering for a new stock there was one

32
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,168
that excite you as well as the
three-phase ickes or signal where he

33
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:48,859
took the same clock signal and extorted
against itself with a face shape of 0 45

34
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:55,650
and 90 degrees and another one would be
just simply directly flip over the clock

35
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,049
signal for set duration and this
actually work for me and the Arduino

36
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,319
example that was going to be covered up
ahead another thing that was suggested

37
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,750
to me was the increase clock speed

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,668
simply double the clock rate supply to
the device and this I didn't really have

39
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:24,250
much success with unfortunately so with
power switch and tax

40
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:30,220
we can do either Braunau or voltage
flaking attack and with brown attacked

41
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,940
me 'cause propagation delays with in the
ICU to exist and when we do this it's

42
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,219
tends to be a bit more predictable least
in my experience when I was doing it on

43
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,990
the Arduino and cause it's more likely
the cause of right back to fail when

44
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,970
you're doing an attack like this so
something else I tried was to do the

45
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,900
spanking attack which these are simple
them but because you're effectively

46
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:09,400
reducing flooding signals into the
target device you at it significantly

47
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,450
more unpredictable with what you're with
what exactly you're gonna get and it's

48
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,770
also very easy to damage the device if
you don't listen to the ratings on the

49
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:28,810
ship so these are some of the temple
targets for clinching the user pretty

50
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,220
much in a sort of scenarios where you
have some sort of service that you want

51
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:44,680
to steal or on to the bias and in terms
of code you really are just really

52
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,410
target branches and comparisons really
are anything that really has a

53
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:58,280
right-back phase in terms of instruction
but he also target our memory reads and

54
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,929
writes which can yield some certain
interesting results pending on what you

55
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:12,710
do you know where to go over the reset
glitch hack that was done by cleanly and

56
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,969
it is really similar to a clock watching
attack and I say this because you think

57
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,150
it's the effectively the same effect

58
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,049
arise by the clock watching attack which
is you you are skip you're skipping over

59
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,260
an instruction when you're trying to do
this type of attack and considered an

60
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,670
unpatched let's play though Microsoft
did take steps to make

61
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:46,740
themselves against this type of attack
and I'll be talking about the ex play on

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,920
the original Xbox 360 if you look near
the end of the near the end of the

63
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,070
presentation their links to the full
ride a bike legally which also covers

64
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:05,200
the xbox slim so before we go any
further at the top of it more about the

65
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:13,170
Xbox 360 bootloader security and this
works by having a chain of lawyers we're

66
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:21,060
starting with loads in a set a chain of
self verifying pool orders and dance so

67
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:29,570
without really going into much detail
this code is as RSA signed and we also

68
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:39,570
have the nice information being leaked
out by the by the Xbox itself so let's

69
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,040
play consistent really three main
components I would say which is why the

70
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:51,150
CBO P or bypass the recent behavior and
the post bus which gets out signals

71
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:59,659
indicating to what is being executed
within the Xbox 360

72
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:07,980
the CPU PLL bypassed when inserted slows
down the processor to 520 kilohertz and

73
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,150
it allows for significantly easier time
and when we're trying to actually

74
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:21,659
implement the attack on the device now
the reset is really at the core of the

75
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:35,620
of the side of the tap and what happens
here is when you reset on the CPU

76
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:44,990
instead of rushing out all the volatile
information to the within the device has

77
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,940
behavior similar effectively skips
instructions that's being executed on

78
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:59,560
on the Xbox if our at the post bus which
is a bit diagnostic bus which allows us

79
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,709
to have insight to what code is being
executed within the device when we are

80
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:13,910
trying to form a coalition attack on
this so it sends out X 36 signal on the

81
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:21,719
on the bus when we r decrypting than and
and then we send out a text 39 when we

82
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:33,170
are performing a check on the signature
so the exploit targets the RSA signature

83
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:45,650
comparison the Xbox 360 ends and we use
their post by signals in order to know

84
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:55,990
when to actually do so so something else
I also wanted to know was that the

85
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,570
payload itself is set up in a way that's
so it resets when it fails and it

86
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:08,600
indicates to us that even though we have
effectively and idealized version attack

87
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:20,570
we can we it's not quite as reliable as
we find out so much the steps to doing a

88
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,840
reset glitch attack are as follows

89
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,830
so when you load the natural flow the
table to the National using JTAG

90
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:34,290
interface then you monitor for a post
signal using FPGA to indicate when it's

91
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,890
doing that the corruption of the base
kernel so then from here we assert their

92
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:45,569
CPU pillow bypass so we have an idea so
you can quickly or able to catch when

93
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:52,740
the signal of the hash comparison is
happening and then we wait we start

94
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,889
internal counter once we hit post code
39 which

95
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:06,420
we can then at about 62 percent of its
normally executed because we send out a

96
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:13,339
reset signal 409 of seconds and then
after all this we try we go back to

97
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,540
normal execution so Microsoft response
to this was to blow the JTAC fears is

98
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,980
adding additional shack and then begin
banning users with modded Xboxes from

99
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:39,209
xbox live now with the response from the
Xbox hackers where was to use make you

100
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,040
survive newark's play which just
completely bypasses the secondary check

101
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,149
that they had showing that if you just
add on additional chats to the devices

102
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:58,839
they actually want really do you much
good so this is pretty much what we have

103
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:06,319
explained very very linear and made sure
just because of how by all the nice

104
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:12,559
things I would get from the Xbox itself
so this is really because of the post

105
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:22,759
signals that we get which allows us to
have a much more narrow explains so from

106
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:30,339
here we try to develop a general
methodology to develop attacks on other

107
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:37,369
devices so this is not really any real
steps by generally helps out if you have

108
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:43,879
actual access to the disassembly of the
code that you're targeting then you also

109
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,739
need to review the data sheet to make
sure that you actually can to form a

110
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:53,299
coalition attack on the device then you
are tat

111
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:59,459
if possible you should try to test out
the target manually then you try to find

112
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,919
points of it to attack on the target
device depending on if you wanna do a

113
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,709
voltage glitching attack or clock
wishing attack you want to search for

114
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,099
signals on the device which ok

115
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,920
more into that but later and you need to
prepare the target for clinching and

116
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:29,209
finally the you need to set up the FPGA
for performing these attacks so when

117
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,580
you're choosing target code you want to
choose instructions that have typically

118
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:42,140
a branching type of instruction or
security chat target code thats nearby

119
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,390
computationally intensive code you might
be able to make use of power traces to

120
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,030
indicate when you're nearby that code
and you want to make sure that you have

121
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:59,870
you want to target code that can be
easily reached or reset when it fails

122
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,500
and if you don't if not it's much better
that's hard code that's not on top of an

123
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,360
operating system of any sort so if you
can reduce the noise that is between any

124
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:21,110
sort of signals you're you're trying to
read that's much better when reviewing

125
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,940
the data sheets if you're doing a
voltage switching attacking a check but

126
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:32,010
the referee to tolerances are for
voltages and you need to listen to me

127
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,670
especially if you're doing a spanking
attackers you could accidentally Friday

128
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:43,790
Target Chip that you're trying to attack
and ran out the texting you can often

129
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:51,520
times D manufacturers great one but the
minimum pulse width is for the brand new

130
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,990
generation and this helps out helps
determine what the maximum duration is

131
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,240
for one year

132
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,650
doing actual attack of course you also
want to check to see if it buys has any

133
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:16,329
sort of security features and it claims
to have any and yeah this when you're

134
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:24,370
testing the targets tolerances manually
you just use simple code like this

135
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,670
and this is really just to verify it
what if what the manufacturer is

136
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:38,839
claiming about their brownout properties
to be true and some time in practice

137
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,690
when I tried to do this to the Arduino
chip it claimed to microseconds but I

138
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,520
actually ended up with two hundred
nanoseconds so actually better than they

139
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:59,150
claimed so when you're trying to find
points to attack on the Xbox the on a

140
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,709
sort of devices depending on what you're
trying to target your gonna be able to

141
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:10,680
certain things on the board so as an
example if you're trying to do a clock

142
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,979
watching as happy you should try to look
for external crystals on the device and

143
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:23,700
see if you can just rip those out that
supplement Iran clock signals it another

144
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,310
thing is as good as decoupling capacitor
so if you're doing a clock watching

145
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,439
attack you're gonna have to also remove
the the pair of decoupling capacitors

146
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:41,990
nearby the clock also with decoupling
capacitors it's easier just saw her on a

147
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:48,230
wire directly to the high side of the
power else if you're doing about

148
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,440
displaying attack and if you're doing a
brown on attack you're gonna wanna be

149
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,550
careful about removing the coupling
capacitors for the smooth out the

150
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,390
connection to our other things you could
look for voltage regulators and voltage

151
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:14,000
dividers and power supply lines if
you're really feeling adventurous so now

152
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,480
with signals so many buy signal or its
information emitted by the device that

153
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,480
gives you a hint about the internal
executing state and these signals can

154
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,040
vary in terms of value greatly because
of noise introduced during execution or

155
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,740
just the general quality of the signal
that your choosing

156
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:46,640
primary that we're guessing here really
is the maximum delay range so I'm gonna

157
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,929
get more into the clinching parameters a
bit later but we want to make sure that

158
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:58,220
the little a range is about as small as
possible so the signals oftentimes are

159
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,870
used to when are used to start the delay
state or closer and closer to when we

160
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:11,159
are trying to find one we want to start
the counter for our lynchings when they

161
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,700
made out our coaching signal and he
signals can be any one of these can be a

162
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,540
GPO are going to be status LEDs serial
messages any of these things right here

163
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:31,790
so I'm gonna go talk about this equation
a bit more later but it's just a

164
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:43,360
question what is the one that worked out
for me at the end of the day so this is

165
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,780
what I used to calculate from the timing
from disassembly and pretty much at the

166
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,940
low end I took the total amount of
instructions I had and at the high end I

167
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:02,150
took the amount of cycles and this was
just added on like i subtracted the

168
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,950
pipeline size on the low end and added
the pipeline size on the high end just

169
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,700
just because it's the first equation is
not really much rhyme or reason with it

170
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:25,500
is this what works for me and yeah so we
are preparing the device

171
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,120
depending on what we're trying to do it

172
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:38,770
saw her daughter at the type of
clinching on it so with clock regime we

173
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,910
remove it and ice crystal and its nearby
coupling capacitors with the voltage

174
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:50,410
spiking we just can find the decoupling
capacitor and saw her on the high side

175
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:50,860
of the

176
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:57,199
if you think sample for the baltics
taking intact you can look on the ship

177
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,860
was a lie its tutorial which does
exactly this goes on the highest has you

178
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:13,530
solder wire to the high side of the the
cap our cap and lets you do voltage

179
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,139
coaching like that you're doing a brown
on attack on a device it's best if you

180
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:25,809
either just remove the device altogether
or if you find the voltage regulator

181
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:31,720
directly connecting to it and just move
out of any sort of decoupling capacitors

182
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:45,559
so this is so pretty much like this is
what I ended up trying to create my

183
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:55,740
gigantic state machine for the device I
can't really read it that well from here

184
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,679
but starting at the top we wait for some
sort of initializing soon know when the

185
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,679
sent out our test case if we have any
and then from there we either way for

186
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,840
some signal or just go through timing
window after this test signals sent out

187
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:24,659
and when we pledge and from after their
after their then we try to win either

188
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:34,280
wait for a sample or we start to the
bias and try again so the the parameters

189
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,790
that were trying to get up are the
duration which is the amount of time

190
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:48,918
that we send a signal out two and signal
could be anything from our our clock

191
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:55,910
glitch signal or the amount of time we
drown out the bias of the power supply

192
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:03,070
to the device the delay is the widest
like that we have and this is

193
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,519
when we visit the period from

194
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:15,720
way to send out are losing signal now
another thing you also have to consider

195
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,580
as I these types of attacks don't always
work the first time when he tried it so

196
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,389
you oftentimes at the end up just trying
trying it over and over again or tight

197
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:38,269
range and so generally is the FPGA
components that are used on the the

198
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,450
device and the consists of three
different components one is the

199
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,200
glittering device which is something
that generally did not change too much

200
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,929
and this was the actual device that sent
out the glitching signal and took in the

201
00:22:52,929 --> 00:23:01,830
signals from the test case and the
sampling device so the the test case

202
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:08,090
that I S is the one that actually sends
out a test case to the target device and

203
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,178
this could also just be four is also
just monitor for one to start the delay

204
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:21,919
phase the one we put it down our to send
out the glitch signal out and the

205
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,070
sampling devices the one that checks for
Fr clinches actually successful or not

206
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:34,350
this is this is a piece of code that
should be at the highest presidents

207
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:50,580
because just the nature of the tools I
use whereas the easier on nano devices

208
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,330
and this Fu J journal did its job fairly
well considering that didn't actually

209
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:08,580
having sort of 5 all else and it's
something to consider is what the output

210
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,530
voltages of the

211
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:20,670
the device as well as what the maximum
clock speed is for it so on the 18th

212
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:32,820
only thing I tested I tested both clock
ran out and the code I tested was very

213
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:40,510
simple code which would talk and led on
and off for a small duration of time and

214
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,100
extremely long you so they used two
different test cases one would blink and

215
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,330
led on and off 41 milliseconds and the
other one with putting it off for one

216
00:24:51,330 --> 00:25:00,820
second and these is that would go on
forever and when it exited out it would

217
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:09,010
turn on another led and indicate when we
were successful with our coaching attack

218
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:19,830
those are really rudimentary example
that I use so far in the clinching

219
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,169
attacks I supply direct I directly
supplied what I was attacking to the

220
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:34,480
device and I only reset the device when
it actually didn't respond back helping

221
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:47,080
get more consistent results so signal
used for both of them was that are going

222
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:53,649
to be led on and off so that was the
main cause I mean test case that I

223
00:25:53,650 --> 00:26:03,780
observed to send out my doorway ranges
to so something then I went on to go

224
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:09,799
test the threshold which I mentioned

225
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:16,119
so this is the instruction cannon from
before and this is the the range is when

226
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:27,039
I got tight and tighten the range use
for the delay on the device and this

227
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,070
terrorist equations and one that just
works for me

228
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:38,239
examples there's not really a science to
it was just what I initially tried to

229
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:46,350
count the cycles to the between the
disassembly you referring between that

230
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:54,529
and the data sheet and that thing quite
work for somebody is on a smaller value

231
00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:03,980
for the delay went to send out the
signal and as an example of my clock

232
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:12,639
which set up which isn't quite complete
because rate here this is the logic

233
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:19,600
converter there was an additional wire
connecting out from here to here which

234
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:33,730
is led that blinks on when the alleged
successful so I use a duration of 60 to

235
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:42,269
90 seconds for the false and I use both
directing store and a three-phase X-ers

236
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:47,509
successfully against the device the
delays for it however we're fairly

237
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:56,359
consistent whenever I perform the actual
attack on a device versus the two

238
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,830
examples

239
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:03,109
actually came out to be pretty much same
value in terms of the delay value found

240
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:13,309
and the value was actually smaller than
expected so this is a non connected on

241
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,790
fully connected

242
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,899
voltage coaching set-up and the thing
that's nice about they 328 psi you just

243
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:28,390
powered off 3.3 both Wales that's really
helped me save a lot of time when I

244
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:36,280
needed to perform this experiment so
with this performed ran out lynching and

245
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,500
the delays were fairly similar but
durations always very whenever I got a

246
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:49,970
successful lage out and took more tries
it took a longer time to work then the

247
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,230
clock wishing which would work within a
matter of seconds this one might take a

248
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:03,630
few cycles and certainly sets in order
for it to work so this is just me going

249
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:12,860
over what I use for any FPGA parts
sections watching the draft picks or in

250
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,169
a three-phase

251
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:23,420
and not much else to say about this so
problems encountered are issues with the

252
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,330
EU standard issues with your PC at ease
your logic translate the logic

253
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,649
translation between eighty mega and the
FPGA standard analog problems and when I

254
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:39,450
tried to do the transistor switch for
the brown out type of fishing on a boat

255
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,390
example I encountered problems with
having to delay introduced from the

256
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:55,020
transistor switch so this is another
example this is the LBC 1343

257
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:04,190
development board from a programmable
logic training class and this is meant

258
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,260
to be used as a timing attack example
which communicates out over serial

259
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,580
asking for a password and I decided the
use this probably very poor judgment as

260
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,889
a sheer black box attempts to see if it
were really plausible the try to the

261
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,630
black box

262
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:34,360
so simply would monitor 44 I would send
out a test case to the device with 17

263
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:43,300
A's 17 A's and then I would monitor back
for incorrect example message for the

264
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:50,250
message sent back this required me to
build additional logic or take

265
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:58,190
additional logic to do some cereal to do
some cereal parsing and that stuff in

266
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:05,180
practice this year the signal self had
very large ranges so this turned out

267
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,250
they also be a very poor quality signal
that use to gain insight to what was

268
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:20,730
being executed within the device so
moving on like 18 prepared the board I

269
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,980
ended up removing the troops pressed on
the board with a bit of heat and

270
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,820
mechanical for us and also remove the
decoupling capacitors as you can see

271
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:42,899
right kind of yeah so once again is what
I use mister actually buy

272
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:49,440
yes so inclusion with this one actually
was not successfully attacking this and

273
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,140
I suspect the reason why is because it
was constructed as timing attack type of

274
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,610
exercise so there may have been like
multiple comparisons being done against

275
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:08,209
the each character within the cascode
which would then have a delay introduced

276
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:14,780
per comparison and with us basically
amounted to was having multiple checks

277
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:26,340
on every single character being done so
the story here as you don't have a dump

278
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:34,929
sort of this assembly of what you're
targeting we're gonna have a bad time

279
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:42,120
alright so this is not talk about the
things I wanted the trial but didn't

280
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:50,610
have enough time to so this is door lock
example so right here at the top is an

281
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:55,449
emergency power jack and i thought maybe
just be kind of neat if I could get a

282
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,540
clinching exploit working on it

283
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:03,500
fortunately there is no capacity ratio
which actually quite a stop me from

284
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,580
really being successful with it

285
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,439
given if I pried off the doorknob like I
had done so if I want to try to do

286
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,210
things happen it will really have much
point because this thing right here is

287
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,020
that connector to the motor drives a
doorknob so there wasn't really much of

288
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,850
a point to do this example and even if I
did get successful attack off on it

289
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:33,659
would be fairly difficult to build a
drink in order to perform an attack on

290
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:44,430
the doorknob and this is this is the
until Galal I wanted to do and a test on

291
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,940
this one the sea would be like to try to
clinch out assists architecture device

292
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:57,310
this one will probably be done using a
voltage switching attack but I want to

293
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,240
point out the crystal right here which I
believe this is like 250 megahertz

294
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,700
crystal and the moral story here as I
you are pretty much gonna be limited by

295
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,710
what your heart your hard work and do
when you're trying to do these types of

296
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:21,070
attacks so and finally we have the
set-top box which I was way more than a

297
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,130
little ambitious when I tried to really
broke out this thing so just as an

298
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:31,590
example numeration we have our external
crystal right here on this unknown diet

299
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:38,010
which would definitely complicated
things and over 80 here we have a

300
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,090
voltage regulator which

301
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:45,000
may or may not be wise to tack on this
thing is seen as it draws about two

302
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,370
hundred millions from from what I
measured

303
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,819
now look at the underside and learn a
bit about where these decoupling

304
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:02,960
capacitors will be located and in
practice most home from people with

305
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,780
diabetes decoupling capacitors are
typically directly underneath the device

306
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:13,610
that you're trying to help shield to you
know the help of waiting sort of extra

307
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,290
jitter which is effectively what you're
trying to reduce to the targeted by ass

308
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:27,930
if you're looking for any sort of like
decoupling capacitors on a beach a

309
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:37,890
package type forum such as this unknown
device usually just look directly under

310
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:43,609
it and you'll find the decoupling
capacitors right there so experiments

311
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:48,230
for the future really wanted to do a
clinching attack on a device that had a

312
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,810
frequency multiplier I just wanted to
see how that would end up working out

313
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:59,290
attacking devices which claimed to have
some sort of medications against it also

314
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:05,380
combining multiple types of attacks
Musharraf I put this paper inside the

315
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,390
citations but somebody actually tried to
use of clinching attacked by road use

316
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:18,290
sorry so I tried to implement their
clock watching attack on by having it on

317
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,850
having a device on a hot plate which
actually help them out when they're

318
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:29,339
trying to do their their clock which was
pretty interesting I know what it's like

319
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:34,740
that's had memory devices and how
possible it would be attacked them some

320
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:41,879
code that's running on top of an
operating system so if you're on the

321
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,990
defense side the you should try to look
for devices which have these things

322
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:53,279
which are quick to tell us very good
run-out detection

323
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,370
blocks of course performing checks on
another asynchronous internal clocks

324
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:04,180
with dummy cycles devices whether
internal oscillator is because they have

325
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,759
an internal oscillator and can't really
clock legit invalid instruction

326
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,600
execution which actually but mitigate
against

327
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,600
maker of make life pretty difficult to
successfully get a clinching attack off

328
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,680
and and finally you should also just not
have any unnecessary diagnostic signals

329
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,569
on your device which give attackers
hints to what code is being executed

330
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:38,460
within the bus so if you're a bender you
want to search for these eye sees and

331
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:46,010
you also should definitely try to test
against that if you write code to defend

332
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,200
against these types of attacks at the
end of the day you're really just gonna

333
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:59,080
be buying time if your devices are
vulnerable to attacks so the conclusions

334
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,480
pushing attacks are cheap but they vary
greatly and implementation one

335
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,140
performing of Legends hack multiple
trials are often required and if your

336
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,810
offender should try before you buy

337
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:20,660
so this is what I have a problem I have
enough piece of the materials I suggest

338
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:31,399
the rear right so many questions

339
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:43,180
solely by time I wanted the user's
device actually but I was so used to

340
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:52,299
using the 1901 I don't my PJs stuff you
can use it I I'd imagine there's

341
00:38:52,299 --> 00:39:04,759
definitely have one like I try to use it
a little bit yeah so like my torturers

342
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:25,059
are a like my fam I got it yeah yeah but
I want to use it more tho famous last

343
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:31,520
words many people

344
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:53,960
I mean I really wanted to move on the
glitching like a full blown system

345
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,630
ultimately ended up at getting enough
time to try to do so and besides I would

346
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:06,890
have to deal with the whole responsible
disclosure process to do so yeah I

347
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:17,790
really wanted to do that any other
questions

348
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,150
yes pretty dangerous are you wanna take
it around the thing you're targeting

349
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:30,130
general idea don't want to take it you
don't take the decoupling taps out your

350
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,860
crystal if you're just doing a burnout
is happy but like any of the power went

351
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,210
out so you think you're targeting you
should try to take those out but yet

352
00:40:39,210 --> 00:41:05,359
that you want to do that slowly because
it's

353
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:19,078
I tried doing some experiments like that
on a device and it was quite successful

354
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,779
in terms of doing that now is required
in the honest with you

355
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:29,289
terms of like doing a lot of it happen
as we're trying to say write short the

356
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:39,890
power caps out I just think that I just
started was made like that it's a lot

357
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,499
easier to target voltage regulator
supplying the juice to it because there

358
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:49,069
might be like multiple might be like the
multiple lines depending on the device
