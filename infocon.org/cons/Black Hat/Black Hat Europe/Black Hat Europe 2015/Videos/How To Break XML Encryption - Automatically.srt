1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,130
so this story is about how America's
immigration article and it is a joint

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,130
work with my colleagues described so you
don't mind sharing myself it was

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,720
actually submitted for presentation at
the conference which is also an author

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,590
2015

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:34,620
in summer and we extend our collection
and make america automatically so that

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,390
everybody can verify the nation is
correct so should inquire about me so I

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:54,600
am secretary social structure when
should we are doing some stuff online

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,559
services systems

9
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:06,700
currencies assault here we are doing a
text and provable security our cherished

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:16,900
part of security which is this ok we
also provide some imagination and

11
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:30,810
security analysis in this case let's
talk a tax on its not sure what services

12
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,290
and so forth

13
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:46,570
security the president is not necessary
to understand the complications of the

14
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:57,408
general idea behind its not authorized
on a tricky and reaction scheme and then

15
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,750
I will discuss the contract

16
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:17,329
ok so let's start with some basics what
is up to us and declined was executive

17
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:30,100
function and urinary function on the
website we use a prime and their clients

18
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:42,320
and get a prime function and perhaps it
into the server generates this one and

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,650
after us it's perhaps it's a message and
resources ok so this is a very simple

20
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,340
example but we have more complicated for
example the client can talk a lot of

21
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,670
broke the bank insurance company
sometime along this is also possible he

22
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:11,730
is using some and so on and we can ask
so how much security areas so how could

23
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:21,209
apply security people who are trying to
say okay so what's the problem

24
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:29,209
pls the messages are secure during the
transport so the crisis message or

25
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:40,140
security system and send it to the bank
or insurance company so problems and

26
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,440
messages during the transport what we
need to have some kind of message rules

27
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:55,630
apply some look on the message service
providers and the broader

28
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:07,010
modified because security directly about
their cryptic message so this is

29
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,489
achieved using its not security

30
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:16,970
its securities standard and describes
how to apply cryptographic algorithms to

31
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:23,870
analyze it causes basically two
standouts it's it's not national which

32
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:38,900
allows you to protect our meeting held
at this time so you can and you can read

33
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:47,789
and sign only part of the command guns
or you can understand it was it is used

34
00:04:47,790 --> 00:05:01,810
for example buddy icon from various
European cities like banking Stonehouse

35
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:13,600
you to use external security ok who give
you some idea behind the problems and

36
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:36,090
some of its operation is location and
what we do is create something I want to

37
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:47,359
secure is so weak central oppression and
then we think I see not sure and include

38
00:05:47,360 --> 00:06:11,050
and timestamp afterwards to compute the
problem the problem is it's not so what

39
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:20,600
he can do for example take place it
somewhere

40
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:42,420
the origin and since the idea of it is
now and now you're actually or the

41
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,580
singer asha

42
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,550
snatch operations and create a new
function invocation

43
00:06:50,550 --> 00:07:05,150
researchers also so let's take a look at
the message processing so typically the

44
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:20,060
summer of 2006 and operational security
message location and what is it goes to

45
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:31,100
the security office takes your hand and
verifies it

46
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:40,420
messages indicated the application and
involves the body so there is a problem

47
00:07:40,420 --> 00:08:02,170
if you use the same message ok so this
should only be used for control of the

48
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:14,850
russian she's so messages and so he
acquired the car control arafat's

49
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,980
signature and could somehow she knows
what we could do

50
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:32,770
and centralized control and it's the
incidences of the victim more recently

51
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:52,760
last year I could use some scenarios and
it's actually on applications and so you

52
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:03,670
know it's not the time of the 32 nations
are not easy and so they also it's not

53
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:18,160
working and found out that one half of
the country's military use some clouds

54
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:35,250
about our problems now we are going to
decide who should get a typical in its

55
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:45,440
not interviews expand the use encryption
so what we do is we want to encrypt we

56
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:59,710
can start and completely and retirement
and incredibly we encrypt and the

57
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:16,320
session later and tell us as much
recognition is 30 and 40 we create some

58
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:28,580
binding treaty and using a Torrance CA
April 2012 some addicts encryption

59
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,870
scheme used black

60
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:48,120
and the show how to extract symmetric
keys should also from the plan as usual

61
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:56,490
ok what you need to know now is that
these are chosen ciphertext

62
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:11,010
what they do is have a client and server
and the client wants to send today and

63
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:33,610
and regulator so it's and they heard us
he uses a sense of responsibility so

64
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:46,310
long time until the end of the message
this is just a general and how they work

65
00:11:46,310 --> 00:12:09,640
and we recruit for his 43rd and we lost
400,000

66
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,819
similarities

67
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:24,488
and in the next like I would like to
present a symmetric encryption schemes

68
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:36,209
of the basic ideas a bit deeper into the
details but don't worry if you know how

69
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:50,449
your fire is not a complete ok so much
and Christian holy work so we are

70
00:12:50,449 --> 00:13:16,319
assured her or not and lies what is why
we can use my hands on it and how to use

71
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:31,039
it to record so it's not a test case
they have every right to be parsed and

72
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:38,699
the characters which are contained in
the same how are you asking for ASCII

73
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:50,689
ASCII format which last year to 928
characters and symbols and you can see

74
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:57,849
here on the left

75
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:07,549
character or symbol there are some
simple recipe escapes left you have some

76
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:24,319
specific character they are not possible
then we have found or transparency for

77
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:34,960
smile these are also a bigger and then
we have your honor right now and so on

78
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:47,140
and so on and other characters like that
I'd be carter's we have only type B

79
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,180
carter's so the company is only
characters from the other side and the

80
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,849
only these characters

81
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:09,140
why we can use integration so what we do
is if you send service service

82
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:22,270
attempts to your first message the
message and then there are some of it is

83
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:35,300
logical progression of our history arson
and if this is something so if we send

84
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,170
plain text and get some party from
sponsors for the message should be

85
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:57,069
problematic because described used
racial best we could somehow make direct

86
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:15,650
service we have to ask him again so we
have your characters and we say that we

87
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:24,860
have hundreds if the first person on
earth first but it is always you know

88
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:33,970
it's fun and to the pastry to define the
concrete

89
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:48,980
role as he is recognized by a bee and
some nice and now suppose we can inflict

90
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:56,420
arbitrary basically playing this weekend
we can do

91
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,099
Texas

92
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:12,860
imagine we have power and respect the
first one and two of this heart I'll be

93
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:25,299
so what's there and he wants to record
his character be and what happens now

94
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:41,950
base to slip it through which we are
still on the counter now build one jump

95
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:49,789
to the left and again we will jump to
the left and there is an invalid

96
00:17:49,789 --> 00:18:02,879
character and recent was this answer the
phone message and we knew that we were

97
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:17,289
in this because we wanted to let you
know that we are just a basic idea was

98
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:29,870
sleeping because of CBC mode of
operation initialization and if you want

99
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,299
to record it goes to bas operation

100
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:42,110
the 2004 Indian general

101
00:18:42,110 --> 00:19:03,389
and it was so this way because it's like
14 carries about which were encouraged

102
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:17,500
to decide okay so now

103
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:28,040
the basic idea behind the tolerance
messages so the messages are not

104
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:37,360
modified because it's really hard to
enforce the property is important

105
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:51,270
messages and now leaving so soon as I
already mentioned so imagine we have to

106
00:19:51,270 --> 00:20:05,440
show which protects the body which is
encrypted or the other hand do so

107
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:15,050
body through security and this thing out
reparation our bodies and he can define

108
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:24,850
all intrepid mines in Mali and force the
grocery store system through israel is

109
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:45,120
always on it and it's recruited and also
came to his son Christian wrapping up so

110
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,800
that I can leave everything as it is
what we find some new entity and Andhra

111
00:20:50,800 --> 00:21:08,879
Pradesh for us to process them so they
came from and business you are used for

112
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:20,170
encryption and will produce some old
messages ok so the question is how we

113
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:27,670
stole some critical attacks

114
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:41,420
from national problems and so on and so
on and so on and so on

115
00:21:41,420 --> 00:22:02,080
services get up and it supports abortion
and so on and so on and so the argument

116
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,860
that apply to Verisign what is the basic
approach behind his song planning

117
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:20,459
processes in three steps first domestic
security so what what what protections

118
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:31,340
remove something controversial
afterwards it excuse to get three steps

119
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:40,780
on the first phase we have a direction
face to face to face the inputs and

120
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:47,620
critics and all that goes into place and
try to identify the security of this

121
00:22:47,620 --> 00:23:02,129
message has announced its ok which which
regulate there are two different things

122
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:12,070
and protects the body and mind that I
this is the first place in the analysis

123
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:28,580
is none of this information knowledge to
go to the place and time stamp or not so

124
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:55,269
and if we have to add the Oracle so we
are meeting up with frozen cyber attacks

125
00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:14,380
are responsible ok I get it through to
this true or false for two months

126
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,070
messages so we need to construct an
orchestra of its ok so this

127
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:30,269
implementation reprimands some
limitations or maybe ok and at the end

128
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:44,620
we applied yet and so our paper we
analyze servers and applications but she

129
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:57,739
has to step up our Axway gateway and
Microsoft conflagrations estimate could

130
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:07,210
attack and a symmetry Creek we could
have had access to the city's 78 and 80

131
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:15,870
power window frame iraq was not able to
get a controversial topic in general if

132
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:22,879
you play with the controversial some
situations you can also a cheap boots

133
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:54,919
validation on

134
00:25:54,919 --> 00:27:59,660
I described

135
00:27:59,660 --> 00:29:48,060
ok ok I want to

136
00:29:48,060 --> 00:30:55,190
so

137
00:30:55,190 --> 00:32:32,470
to

138
00:32:32,470 --> 00:35:32,690
secure

139
00:35:32,690 --> 00:36:33,220
yeah yeah

140
00:36:33,220 --> 00:40:10,609
security before

141
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:41,460
and then the crib the crib only if the
matter was so so but but the problems

142
00:40:41,460 --> 00:42:00,740
would not recommend storm's

143
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:17,040
messages maybe the messages always the
same what can I do it so maybe I can use

144
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,660
maybe some other side like this title
did not analyze it for the symmetric

145
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:36,089
case but you know 2012 paper part so I
particularly athletic site protects the

146
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:42,360
cryptic message to Sarah 46 further with
