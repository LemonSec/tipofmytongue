1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,350
so it's my pleasure to introduce her in
a long time

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,029
security contributor and thinking on the
trends in direction of the security

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:24,510
industry I really look forward to your
speech ok so quickly thanks I've done

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,859
lots of black hats but made it too
precious few keynotes I'm really glad

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,899
that you guys actually took the time to
come down so I'm going to blitz through

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,850
them a little bit

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,850
try to make up for some time but
hopefully it should be fine

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,489
really quickly I'm going to skip the bio
but jeff's already covered most of it

9
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,530
though the one thing that I did want to
say is i've got a bit of a background we

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,750
spent a long time breaking stuff
breaking applications breaking networks

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,539
then spent a fair amount of time trying
to actually defend them and more do

12
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,500
simply putting all products that people
can use to help secure themselves and I

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,479
think this is interesting just because
lots of what I'm going to say today

14
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,689
comes from this kind of mixed
perspective and it's something that I'm

15
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,899
hoping we can take away so I guess the
first question that most of you should

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:25,680
have is what's with the cheesy title and
answer is fairly simple earlier this

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,479
year at troopers I gave a talk called
the hard thing about hard things are

18
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,420
meant for those of you who haven't
recognized it that was based on a book

19
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,729
by Ben Horowitz and that talks seem to
go down pretty well people seemed to

20
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:46,820
like it so being a man of science I
figured number of talks have given where

21
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,408
the table was based on a book one number
of talks people actually liked one

22
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:58,310
seemed like a good idea to to try for a
second one before before we actually go

23
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,280
on though one of the questions you
probably have to ask is how much of a

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,050
problem we actually talking about so
lots of what I'm going to talk about is

25
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,170
the problem we currently face and the
question that you should be asking is is

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,700
this even a problem Dan Gill was
recently quoted a paper that went out by

27
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,049
Chatham House which officially holds
that the level of security in cyberspace

28
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,650
is far better than most of us know ok
and the people actually isn't that bad

29
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,460
if you go through it

30
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,620
the main crux of what they saying is
that people keep depicting cyber crime

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,210
in absolute terms sold fifty a taxpayer
funded by taxpayer hundred-thousand text

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,240
via when they should be taking it as a
percentage of internet says okay and as

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,960
a percentage of internet says cyber
crime doesn't look as bad so I think

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,880
it's a valid argument but I personally
agree most would Brian snow ok and Brian

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,400
snow shit on recognized him was X
director for information assurance for

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,770
the NSA

37
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,530
who gave a talk titled cyber security
status is grim and the way ahead will be

38
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,370
hot at a conference in Malta

39
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,550
end brands point essentially was that
your cyber systems continue to function

40
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:26,410
and so not due to the expertise of your
security stuff chiefly just due to the

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,290
sufferance off your opponents and that's
uncomfortable going to hear ok no matter

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,579
how many times you say the matter how
many times you shared it always feels

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,200
slightly uncomfortable in 2011 the peace
that we put out called

44
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,380
upcoming security apocalypse ok which
sounds all dramatic but essentially what

45
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,450
we were saying is that we will be
building a less tax on the house of cots

46
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,000
and we spoke in the paper about an
impending crisis that faced information

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,870
security and essentially we were talking
about a crisis of confidence

48
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,110
ok we said that we don't reliable and we
can use the same excuses we've been

49
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,820
using and at some point this house of
cards is gonna come tumbling down and

50
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,149
we're the ones who are going to look it
in the individual post ahead a simple

51
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,200
litmus test which i think we'll try here
so what I want

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,450
you guys to do a show of hands how many
of you as network defenders just out of

53
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:35,150
interest if you can just raise your
hands about half so what I want you guys

54
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,640
to figure is I want you to imagine the
highest value individual that you've

55
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,310
gotten your cooperation

56
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,630
ok I'm talking about the guy whose
computer and all of the assets that that

57
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,890
guy touches you absolutely do anything
to protect and the question then is how

58
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,550
willing are you to say that you could
stop a determined attacker from

59
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:06,360
compromising him with a show of hands ok
this time the numbers easier to count so

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,630
as bad as it sounds

61
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,469
this is pretty commonplace and one of
the harsh truths that this kicks up is

62
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,960
how ineffectual can we be right

63
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,250
your organization these days spends
hundreds of thousands millions of

64
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,140
dollars on security and the one guy who
matters most

65
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,200
you can't protect and in most cases you
don't even know when he's popped ok

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,479
that's a pretty dodgy place to be and
it's got all the shades of the global

67
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,730
financial crisis and lots of money
changing hands lots of people getting

68
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:46,520
rich on the surface lots of checks and
balances but ultimately nobody's really

69
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,060
speaking the truth to paula nobody is
admitting how brutal the whole thing is

70
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,960
and what we were saying is that the
problem gets slightly worse because

71
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,180
bloods are now increasingly involved ok
for long time we used to say the boards

72
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,970
are not involved the balls don't buy in
but now they are and they're making the

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,440
logical assumption that the people they
paid have this under control right

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,230
because they've now given us budgets and
they do stuff and they think that we

75
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,280
doing stuff and they just don't know how
little of it we've got under control

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,719
they don't know that we've got very few
ounces and for the most part all of us

77
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,420
are just hoping that the attack doesn't
come on I'll watch and if we talk about

78
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:38,280
a crisis of confidence we already did
okay to steal the famous quote it's just

79
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,289
not evenly distributed yet if you talk
to the people at Target for the people

80
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,810
at OPM or any one of the other major
breaches they gonna turn it on until you

81
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,620
yeah we paid hundreds of millions yes
we've got hundreds of people on our

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,910
security team but holy smokes those guys
just couldn't stop anything when it

83
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:01,270
mattered and I think the stuffs
absolutely gonna get worse

84
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,159
ok and if you ask why it's gonna get
worse there's a bunch of reasons but I'm

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,560
gonna give to be really quickly

86
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,600
the first one Assange and WikiLeaks ok
Assange is is fond of quoting actually

87
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,260
what's a good example when he talks
about cutting edge being contagious ok

88
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,030
and his premise was as a few people
stand up to Palo few people leaked more

89
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,469
and more people get brave and more
people will do it I don't know if that's

90
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,070
true if that goes all the way but what I
do know is that Assange and WikiLeaks

91
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,219
have taught people the value of data so
suddenly more and more people a

92
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,120
secretary working at a small corporation
cook junior members of staff have

93
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,350
started figuring out that actually
access to email Matusz actually access

94
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,210
to the database methods and we have not
figured out how to lock any of that

95
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,530
stuff done yet all of that stuff stalled
ripe for the taking the Metro big one is

96
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,969
snowden ok and I'm not going to question
whether what he did was right to what he

97
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,670
did was wrong but one of the things he's
done is brought hacking clearly into the

98
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,450
mainstream

99
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:18,039
a whole bunch of people had no idea what
could be done with attacks are suddenly

100
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,700
going on with oh well that's cool we can
totally use that to look at stock prices

101
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,219
before the stop before get a jump on the
stock market can you stopping to see you

102
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,979
he searches do stuff like Tennessee
place at which is let's duplicate tools

103
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,740
that were in the NFC catalog but if
researchers are doing this you can bet

104
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,169
that the stuff's happening in the
underground also and that's gonna stop

105
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:42,929
bubbling up

106
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,859
and we're gonna have to a ball game
seriously and the next one touch on his

107
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,360
complexity ok like I said the troopers
talk was almost completely dedicated to

108
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,180
complexity and the problems it causes so
I'm going to skim through it really

109
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,399
quickly for one thing it's totally not a
new realization right way back in 99

110
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,430
Shiota post that said the networks of
the future going to be more complex and

111
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,529
therefore less secure and he basically
says look this the complexity of runs

112
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,279
away from us we've got no way to manage
this we've got two options either we get

113
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,990
used to being insecure we find some way
to put to hit pause and once we hit

114
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,360
pause we can secure stuff and I guess
all of you know we haven't hit pause the

115
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,480
Linux kernel back in ninety one had
about 10,000 lines of code today it's

116
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,140
sitting at about twenty million lines of
code Google Chrome like chromium is

117
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,430
almost twenty million lines of code ok
if you talking about

118
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,099
auditing just the stuff that using to
browse the internet the task is getting

119
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,660
ridiculous and everywhere you look
there's more and more complexity

120
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,770
examples up really quickly

121
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,420
the DVI adapter some Mac developers a
little while back cut open the DVI

122
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,329
adapter that ships with the max and
finds its got a system on a chip and two

123
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,240
gigs of them home from sprites mod
essentially of land Linux on a hard

124
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,150
drive controller ok so not installing it
in the hard drive on the hard drive

125
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:30,959
controller onions olives at at 303
essentially showed that these tiny

126
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,699
microSD cards have on-board controllers
ok these things cost like between 15 and

127
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,320
30 cents and then got on board
controllers that they were able to

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,980
deflation hijack the stuffs the
particular see out of control

129
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,880
aleksandr school from crowds like last
year or earlier this year figured out

130
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,180
that most modern

131
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,790
monitors actually have a hundred and
fifty megahertz processor x86 processor

132
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,360
running in the house yet another threat
model if you try to stop stuff in your

133
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,649
organization what does this stuff even
feature for you

134
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,200
microSD cards monitors hard drives the
stuffs ridiculously out of control

135
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,160
something that popped up just the other
day and I figured I had a dream that you

136
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,459
are just cause it was interesting how if
you saw this Java serialization bug that

137
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,739
just showed up okay it's it's
particularly interesting one because it

138
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,950
gives you a remote code execution almost
trivially but what's interesting is the

139
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,970
bug was announced in January in almost
nobody saw it like everyone just ignored

140
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,500
this month until this paper came out and
said hey you guys probably want to check

141
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,940
these guys presentation because it's
going to be dangerous

142
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,250
the cost it though without going into
the serialization bug is a bug in a

143
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:00,370
third-party lively and Apache loudly
that ships often would job so if you've

144
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,850
got a job insulation chances are you
getting this label of the and chances

145
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:11,200
are this label these vulnerable how does
that fit into that model ok and if what

146
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,380
you doing if you're one of the few
people who are magically somehow putting

147
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,120
labels movies and automatically patching
them daily

148
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,430
you bump bump into what I'm calling the
Bob Ippolito problem

149
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,790
ok and that's totally made up words so
made up problems so you're not going to

150
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,449
see it anywhere else but it's stolen
from presentation that Rohde McCune give

151
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,800
Saudi McCune give this presentation at
all where he basically looked at a whole

152
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,150
bunch off software repositories and all
access to them was controlled and right

153
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:50,160
at the top what you should see his pipe
pipe pipe ok so the pipes and software

154
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,350
repository is based the access to it is
based on the username and password and

155
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,760
so if you look at popular repositories
like simple Jason for example you'll

156
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,590
find that it's been downloaded

157
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:13,780
close to eighty million times ok because
simple Jason's in everything and whoever

158
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,339
he is

159
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:20,930
has a username and password that he uses
to update simple Jason and if any of you

160
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,750
are running Django pylons or whiskey
flask chances are you doing work with

161
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,240
simple Jason and chances are the
security of your product depends on how

162
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,110
safe Bobby Pulido keeps his username and
possible would for simple Jason ok

163
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,720
complexity why is it's off the charts
most people don't see it coming and

164
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,710
effects in people that they released
called back to basics cut to the to the

165
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,930
meat of it reaches security is a
composite of a whole bunch of things and

166
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,319
in any composite system there's no
critical gate everything's agate ok and

167
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,510
it kind of killed any hope we had off
gate styled security so essentially what

168
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:14,819
I'm saying is we in bad shape it's going
to get much worse and again most people

169
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,680
don't know this when when I put all this
the stalk title a few people contacted

170
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,930
me some of them being place and what was
interesting is most of the requests from

171
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,599
the press were guys going hold on you
say this is bad but it can't be that bad

172
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,630
right

173
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,740
like Usain companies don't have this
under control but most of them do

174
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,370
tonight and it's kind of strange to tell
them no actually read this massive

175
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,570
industry in no we don't have the stuff
under control so Alex Thomas gave a talk

176
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,580
that are referred to a few times he
noted a tab sick and he kind of split

177
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,080
the world or his split the fortune 500
and from them he said look you've got a

178
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,200
hundred are sorry for the quality of the
slide that's that's how it comes off

179
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,290
YouTube in the snow sleds release

180
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,469
essentially said you take the secure one
hundred and in there you've got people

181
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,400
who have a shot at defense not
invulnerable they've got a shot at

182
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,439
defense they've got guys who can do
incident response

183
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,870
they not just playing everything they
get and he said if you look at the

184
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,290
fortune 500

185
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:27,349
there's about a hundred of them in his
words who can play the game and he said

186
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,040
as soon as you drop past that first one
hundred you looking at what he's called

187
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,540
the toasted 400 ok and he's saying those
guys even though the mega companies

188
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,380
multi billion dollar a multinational see
some of them have like three security

189
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,670
guys on stuff okay and what's
interesting to me is I'm willing to bet

190
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:56,329
that those guys don't know that they are
the toasted 400 ok because of the same

191
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,580
problem that I said earlier which is
nobody is saying this out loud nobody

192
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,170
saying yes actually we don't have a shot
if we are multinational and all teams

193
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,270
the small if we're not giving it the
attention it deserves and it sucks and

194
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,949
it sucks particularly because we've been
telling people to care about security

195
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,760
for thirty years and suddenly people
care and we don't have a lot of answers

196
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,590
for them we don't have a lot of to it
this way and you'll be fine so before

197
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,760
coming through I treated the other day
asking this question and the questions a

198
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,270
little awkwardly fleas but essentially I
was saying how many organizations do you

199
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:44,470
guys know where if we broke into them it
wouldn't be 2003 ok and almost everyone

200
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,810
I know and lots of them are guys who've
been in the business for a long time

201
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:54,640
managed to come back with ya we know a
company like that ok and by definition

202
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,250
that means there's a lot of companies
not like that and then you've got to ask

203
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,400
yourself what the hell of we've been
doing for the past fifteen twenty years

204
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:13,030
if attacks that we could do in 2002 and
2003 still work the same way what's

205
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,889
going on and most of us got into this
industry because we wanted to make a

206
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,360
difference we want to actually wanted to
actually move the needle and

207
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,020
Jess based on the results we clearly not
I spoke to one of my friends before

208
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,110
coming here who's a big shot at NCC and
he started telling me look that's true

209
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,850
but you forgetting the reason why and
right now I'm not interested in the

210
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,110
reasons why we sucking I just think we
need the honesty to see we sucking so

211
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,469
that we can at least look at a reset or
reboot of some sort and so one of the

212
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,130
arguments have come through is but at
least we doing something and doing

213
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,200
something is better than nothing and I
don't think so I think pedaling hard in

214
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,450
the wrong direction

215
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,870
doesn't help and unless we actually
honest about where we are

216
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,199
there's a good chance that we set off in
the wrong direction and just pedal like

217
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,130
hell so this brings me to about 20
minutes into the talk how we got to the

218
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,900
title sold is a well-known management
consultant called Peter Drucker and he's

219
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,679
full of quotable quotes he should have
been on Twitter he says if you want

220
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,850
something new you have to stop doing
something old ok and his one of his

221
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,100
quotes kind of inspires the book by
Marshall Goldsmith where he says look we

222
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,500
spend a lot of time telling people what
to do but not a lot of time telling

223
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,049
people what not to do and in the
management since they say that all these

224
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,679
things that people shouldn't be doing
actually stops them from the things they

225
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,559
should be doing so the goldsmiths book
essentially goes through like 20

226
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:56,010
characteristics that they think people
should stop doing I'm not gonna go

227
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,460
through them now except to say some of
them still matched us perfectly telling

228
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,380
the world how smart we r negativity or
let me explain why that won't work

229
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,590
making excuses passing the buck but I'm
not going to use their book at all

230
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:17,659
essentially does just what I want to
talk about security and Tibetans ok so

231
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,530
anti patents pretty straightforward
stuff that you doing because you think

232
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,470
it's helping but it's actually not
helping that much and is probably

233
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,100
harmful so I've kind of got them into
three buckets where we've taken some

234
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,870
long tons develop some bad habits and
I'm missing some opportunities

235
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,020
and al-qaida skim through them the first
1 I'm gonna hit that is penetration

236
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,820
testing and that's because I've done
penetration testing for long time in

237
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:53,540
2011 we gave a talk at 44 con
essentially titled penetration testing

238
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,899
considered harmful ok and considering at
the time I just stopped about thirteen

239
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,940
years of being a Pinterest all my
friends or pin testers it explains why

240
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,410
I've got fewer friends but one of the
funnest things that has to be said about

241
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:15,830
10 testing is we pitched it as a
solution to a problem we now do it

242
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:22,040
routinely but it doesn't seem to be
helping ok and there's a few easy things

243
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,309
that you can use to figure this out so
by far

244
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,350
web browsers have been the easiest part
of attack against people on the internet

245
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,500
how many people actually use browser
based attacks in their Pinterest

246
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,700
exercises ok you'll find the number of
vanishingly small they don't get used on

247
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,470
Pinterest because that's not help in
tests are done and the original thinking

248
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,150
with Pinterest with red teaming was
supposed to be that you had a group of

249
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,309
guys who perfectly emulated a Texas but
increasingly what you'll find is you

250
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,530
have ways that detectives attack in ways
that Pinterest as a tech because all the

251
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,399
pen testers are doing is emulating the
pen testers and pimp testing starts to

252
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,880
become almost a classic version of the
draining the swamp problem

253
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,740
ok and if you haven't heard of the
dating this one problem essentially what

254
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,100
it is you have a mission which requires
you to drain the swamp you go to drain

255
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,219
the swamp and find that it's full of
alligators so you change your mission to

256
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,050
fighting alligators and after a while
you get really good at it to start

257
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:34,110
building tools you've got alligator
fight emetic 20 2010 at some point you

258
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,199
forget that you did to drain the swamp
ok you get so busy fighting the

259
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,770
alligators that that's what you do and
I'm saying largely that's what pin

260
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,430
testing has become the talk obviously
goes through a lot

261
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,440
more but my warning there for my pen
testing flynn's was that interesting was

262
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,470
on the direct cost to become the new AV
ok and if you think about it it's

263
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,570
something they should be considering and
main leads because you can have a

264
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:07,110
Pinterest you can be perfectly pleased
with it on the Pinterest you can be

265
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,189
completely owned and after that whole
exercise you can still be completely

266
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:18,640
honorable ok because pin testing doesn't
address that problem so why are people

267
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,780
doing Pinterest so much there's a bunch
of reasons these days it's easy to sell

268
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,000
people know what it is there's a
checkbox that says have you had a pen

269
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,430
test it feels like we actually doing
something ok we're just kind of all if

270
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:37,220
you started it delivers a result ok so
at the end of the Pinterest people feel

271
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,840
happy because they've got something
tangible but I'm not sure that helps end

272
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,439
just based on the results it doesn't
look like it is in terms of going the

273
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,540
wrong way one of the other things that
consistently surprised me is people who

274
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,930
was so comfortable calculating the risk
in an organization I'm so you talked to

275
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,710
traditionally the guys who I am
compliance or the guys who spend a lot

276
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,040
of their time with spreadsheets and
they'll give you calculations that are

277
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,250
solid like reuse ale and you take
expected loss and you take place of the

278
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:18,990
asset and you get a calculation and
completely boggles my mind because a

279
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,620
whole bunch of reasons she simply
delightful lost a whole bunch of their

280
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,229
docs so much of you guys saw this do you
see how they lost their docs someone who

281
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,570
worked with Deloitte to a doctor when he
left and then happened to be working for

282
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:40,159
Sony and when Sony got hacked those docs
leaked out and all of Sony's self-abuse

283
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,100
way in the wild how do you figure that
will consult on Deloitte's calculation

284
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,820
of the organizational risk I'm with you
think that featured and and there's a

285
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,629
bunch of other places where the stuff
breaks down and I think some of it is

286
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,570
really important for you guys who are
defending networks

287
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,629
I'm willing to bet and it's it's kind of
surprising but I'm willing to bet that

288
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:12,360
your company board has no idea how easy
it is for someone to feed corporate

289
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,699
email I'm willing to bet that the Board
has no idea that the lowly paid help

290
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,210
desk I can reset exchange Edmonds
password reset their password and read

291
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,680
the mail and there's a ton of things
like the site there's a ton of places we

292
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,520
have asked is hidden in the organization
that the people at the top

293
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,090
know about because they don't even know
that that can be done and the guys at

294
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:45,169
the bottom of done too strange things
one is we kind of have become blase

295
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,180
about it so we go yeah of course that's
all mail works you talk to a text that

296
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,410
should be encrypting it and you know
that's not happening in your

297
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,440
organization and so there's a great
disconnect between the people who

298
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,000
actually know how the stuff can go along
and the people who tell you this

299
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,090
organization will go down if someone
reads this person's email and unless we

300
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,980
maybe those to whom we just pretty much
flying blind and if we talk about things

301
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,350
we shouldn't do although really quickly

302
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,399
one of the things we've gotta stop its
not major but it's just irritating as

303
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,000
hell we've gotta stop putting two
breaches in terms of number of records

304
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,530
lost ok for some reason it happens
consistently and it just makes no sense

305
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,770
ok because if you start calculating
breaches based in number of lost records

306
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,370
you got to have a whole bunch of
questions does the anthem breach which

307
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:46,780
lost eighty million records count more
than a defense contractor who just lost

308
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,260
one thing when the one thing happened to
be the plans to strike fighter it

309
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:58,720
muddies the water and it's it's gonna
talk about silly things it's probably

310
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,230
the perfect segue

311
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,420
foster talk about big data because big
data has dominated the floor at the

312
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,389
conference's for the last while

313
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:14,228
and the answer is simple we don't know
what's going on more data will fix it

314
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:21,019
ok we not sure where the bad guys are
more data will fix it and like someone

315
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:26,029
else was saying that for a really long
time it was a pretty common refrain for

316
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:30,349
the collected all mentality which was
let's just get as much as we can and

317
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:36,149
surely will be able to connect the dots
and other than the ethics of it all one

318
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:40,458
of the things that became very clear
from the Snowdon leaks was not all that

319
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:46,309
data wasn't helping connect that many
dots all the data was just becoming more

320
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,918
data ok and if you talking about

321
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,389
city plans to back away from all going
to to really quickly here

322
00:26:54,389 --> 00:27:00,289
threat intelligence and information
sharing so obvious see this year

323
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:06,269
immediate on the seal I think gave an
interesting talk as the keynote

324
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:10,690
really polished talk and he started off
with how difficult but he started off

325
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,379
with like fancy audio and fancy video
but he basically said look things are

326
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:21,908
not working as they stand ok and he went
on to quote Stuxnet and he went on to

327
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:27,139
quote the Christian group and said these
things by posh oil traditional security

328
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:33,178
mechanisms and I thought well right on
and he then followed it up stayed away

329
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:39,070
with and if all we need pervasive true
visibility into all enterprises it's not

330
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,499
a nice to have its absolutely what you
have to have and if you don't have true

331
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:47,919
pervasive visibility and all of this
deep inside you not even playing the

332
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,329
security game right ok and again that
should just have you thinking we've seen

333
00:27:53,329 --> 00:28:00,099
this before so he also speaks about that
intelligence ok and everyone speaks

334
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:04,769
about that intelligence says look this
is a quote requirement because we can

335
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:09,289
tell you what sort of attacks and we can
tell you the other groups that are

336
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:13,250
probably gonna be targeting your
organization and

337
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,390
only tell you I didn't just these things
because the easy targets I picked them

338
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,790
because they perfectly to be cool off
how we make bad decisions buying

339
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:28,629
security stuff because on the phone
these technologies are not horrible ok

340
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:33,820
you can make a perfectly good argument
for threat intelligence you can make a

341
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:39,540
perfectly good in argument for having
full pcap visibility on your network and

342
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,360
their organizations where it would make
sense for them to get it but I'm willing

343
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,830
to bet that that doesn't apply to about
95% of everyone ok because about 95% of

344
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,629
everyone involved any kind of asset and
still has two thousand and threes

345
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,750
problems

346
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,350
ok they still haven't gotten past that
point this is not really need to go if

347
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,659
you take examples up you take opium take
target takes Sony you think those guys

348
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:14,270
needed threat intelligence what they
needed was someone to tell them segment

349
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,000
your network so the first time you get
owned ownage doesn't translate

350
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,420
everything getting on a few OPM you
needed to be told

351
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,920
don't outsource management of your
databases and service to follow

352
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:33,900
Nationals ok that wasn't about threat
intelligence that won the Big Data it

353
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,460
was basic housekeeping ok and we kind of
distract ourselves because we couldn't

354
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,750
sleep the two things consistently and so
the argument that should come back is

355
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,310
but what's wrong with real-time learning
I mean we can learn in real time what

356
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,220
detectives are doing on other networks
and we can use that intelligence and my

357
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,070
question is well how about six years
learning instead of real-time learning

358
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,679
ok because I'm willing to bet I can take
any big network breach from six years

359
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,960
ago and movie do you like to play book
called it a text when done and then I

360
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,440
asked you how would your network hold up
against the city tech and most of the

361
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,590
time there's gonna be a lot of shrugging
and looking at treat ok because large

362
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,649
the we haven't cracked those things ok
how to target happen

363
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,680
external party fished access to the
internal

364
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,880
network lateral movement inside till
they take what they want on EMCOR how

365
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,760
did how did that happen there's not a
lot of details but essentially there was

366
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,090
one point of ownage from that point they
used internal credentials displayed in

367
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:45,000
the network from a show of hands home
you view our networks would survive once

368
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,810
I had domain admin we've been doing this
for 15 20 years like we still did that's

369
00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:00,350
a ridiculous place to be and producer
from from Google probably said the

370
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,340
smartest thing about to say when she
said listen take the money you are going

371
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,470
to spend on kit and use it to pay for
good engineers and then get them what

372
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,490
they want

373
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,650
ok you'll start to see more and more
people saying this if we go to the bed

374
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,520
looking slide again when Alex
distinguished between the top 100 and

375
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,820
the bottom four hundred he put down
three conditions three things that

376
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,770
stopped the bottom four hundred from
climbing up those three are secure

377
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:37,210
software engineering engineering focused
incident response and the ability to

378
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:43,680
create not by solutions that one needed
and one of the questions that come up

379
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,400
really quickly

380
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,840
country use consultants and four while
we tried it ok but one of the things you

381
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,209
have to be honest about again just based
on the results it's not working and you

382
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,610
figure out that you can't outsource your
thinking ok and one of the problems with

383
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,300
consultants other than the fact that
most of them don't have skin in the game

384
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:11,500
is they lack the understanding of your
company's prize jewels ok they don't

385
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,050
understand how your organization works
it into a single necessities ok which is

386
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:24,980
all important if you going to crack this
one of the big things look so you take

387
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,790
much as keynote which he gave in late
1999 ok and one of the things he comes

388
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:36,030
out and says he says listen you need to
understand your prize jewels you need to

389
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,720
know

390
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,559
it matters most for your organization
because if you don't what are you doing

391
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,299
and I've spoken to bunches of
organizations will you look at what they

392
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,650
doing and they tell you they
understaffed and you look at what they

393
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,760
doing and a patching servers and that's
the sticking up almost all of their time

394
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,360
and then you say to them will what
matters most to you and they say the

395
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,408
production line and you say ok what are
you doing on the production line and

396
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:04,710
they say no we're not allowed to touch
the production line

397
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:11,240
ok again what are you doing that's just
busy what we've taken a bunch of things

398
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,010
and we've made it our business to do it
but the stuff doesn't tangibly affect

399
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,210
what really matters

400
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,330
ok and every good presentation should
quote fineman

401
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:27,299
and and find a long time ago spoke about
cargo cult science ok and in his example

402
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:32,470
he said look South China Seas there's
these people who during the war saw

403
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:38,080
planes landing and once the war was over
and the plane stopped lending those guys

404
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,418
essentially tried to recreate what they
saw

405
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,530
so they had guys with coconuts over the
years for flight controllers and they

406
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,970
lit fires four runways and they
dutifully did all the stuff waiting for

407
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:56,480
the planes to lend ok except the plane's
didn't because they were matching the

408
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,400
form of it but essentially didn't do
what matted and I was saying that a lot

409
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,429
of what we are doing is just cargo cult
security we going through the motions we

410
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:10,918
doing the stuff because it kind of looks
at night but it doesn't matter on the

411
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:11,868
ground

412
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:18,230
ok and the results are just about the
same it's kind of a bad habit which is

413
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,199
our next topic

414
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,428
bad habits so one of the bad habits that
on a hit

415
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:31,080
really quickly is this one it's not
perfect let's throw it out ok and all of

416
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,799
you should recognize it again it's not a
new problem in that same keynote that

417
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,119
much gave he actually talks about an
interaction with bulges Rick steve bell

418
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,629
of him and Matt blaze and he basically
says these guys didn't like something

419
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:54,379
the lib GMP liability and so they were
deciding to not use as a sage and

420
00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:00,400
instead go back to using Telnet and much
goes like don't be like that ok he says

421
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,079
you can let those guys be like that
because they academics and they spend

422
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,359
their life looking for the silver bullet
but if you in industry what you should

423
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,420
be doing is taking the best of what you
can all the time but I still see this

424
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:20,140
popup consistently shot hands home near
future are running emmitt in your

425
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:31,920
organization five maybe which is said ok
because I met some really good it's

426
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,720
really useful and it stopped lots of
people who would have been owned from

427
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,759
getting owned and recently I spoke to
one of our clients and I said to him

428
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:45,579
listen why aren't you guys running
Emmett and crew they've got their own

429
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:50,740
diverse engineers and their local device
engineer came to school meet on How I

430
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:57,149
Met can be bypassed ok and it's true and
that can be bypassed but the text that I

431
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,440
hitting those guys every day I'm not
limited by passing attacks if they had

432
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,170
emmitt it would cut the whole swath of
the attack tree don't ok the solution

433
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,589
doesn't have to be perfect just has to
be acceptable for them and we spoke

434
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:18,410
about the Vegas talk this year bring
back the honey pots with you find lots

435
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:24,609
of companies have the strange network
utopia ok so all the talk in Vegas was

436
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:28,598
about bringing honey pots back into the
organization and we've been doing a lot

437
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,579
of work with the sort of stuff and when
you talk two companies you'll find one

438
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,319
of the first questions network security
guys we'll ask you is doesn't that

439
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:40,700
introduces us to my organization what
happens then

440
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,700
and like you can give them good on says
like how it's not going to how you've

441
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,430
got an interpreted language how it's
blah blah blah but the honest answer is

442
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:55,519
just come on who you feeling like you've
got a box we both know you've got boxes

443
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,140
on your network that haven't been
patched since 2008 you've got into full

444
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,950
boxes sitting somewhere on your network
and what you wanted about is will

445
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:09,330
introduce laws on to your network those
two worlds don't match ok there's a

446
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:14,450
utopia that you live in the just doesn't
match the reality and you'll find for

447
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,040
the same reason that we often require
complex solutions when someone's will do

448
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,200
we sell a product called canary and when
people see it one of the first things

449
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,700
they go to is so now you gonna Big Data
the hell out of it like now you've got

450
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,220
census if you win you can stop looking
for and people are surprised when we

451
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,930
tell them no like that's really not be
going with this

452
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,830
like this is not simple it does what it
says on the tin and then it does it

453
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:47,340
because it doesn't need to be that
complex and what we wanted something

454
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:54,140
simple that works and if you talk about
the network is raising questions you

455
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,720
find we've kind of gotten into the habit
of being super contrarian about

456
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,799
everything ok we've really become the No
but guys and Peter Thiel was up there

457
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,780
had an interview recently and someone
asked him about being a contrarian and

458
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,930
he said well look anyone can be a
contrarian it's being a contrarian and

459
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,810
being right that's difficult ok and in
our case I think beyond being right one

460
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,049
of the things that being the contrarian
no gays is doing is it's effectively

461
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:31,590
making organizations reuter loaned us
rich Smith from Etsy cables really nice

462
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:38,040
talked a few times this year on holiday
do security at Etsy and some of his

463
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,430
stuff was genuinely eye-opening ok
because you'll notice right to the top

464
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:48,299
he says what they have to do one of the
big tasks is assisting people to do

465
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,310
their crazy ideas ok and he goes into
civil slides races what we do is hear

466
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,810
people's crazy ideas and then tried to
enable it and what you should be seeing

467
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,529
is that this requires a different set of
skills right because lots of guys came

468
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,950
up as being the firewall guy is being
the network days what you need to be

469
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:13,609
engineers and solution providers because
that's what you need to be doing

470
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:19,328
Alex Thomas takes it further he says
listen you can't be saying to people

471
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:24,049
oh my god what are you thinking this is
what you need to be saying is like yes I

472
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:28,980
hear why you would want that he is how I
think you can do that security and

473
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,989
here's another way we think you can
improve your revenue ok because that's

474
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:38,930
what it's got to and lots of us have
kind of come from this history where

475
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:44,308
security what the guys in the corner ok
we could scream at FM two people and

476
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:50,309
would lead to infection I'll spit I'm OK
and you see even from how many of us

477
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:56,400
choose to self-identify as researchers
ok which is more of us sit in a corner

478
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,890
do stuff and security is rapidly
becoming social ok because like rich

479
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:10,019
says if you introduce blocking to the
organization you'll be ignored and

480
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:17,419
essentially he goes on to say that
blocking is lazy ok and if you lazy and

481
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,519
blocking people will just not passed you
ok essentially he's saying knows a

482
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,499
finite resource and it's a very nice way
to put it as security guys there's only

483
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:33,339
so many knows uganda shelter year and
the rest of them better be let me help

484
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:39,900
you make that happen or else we just
gonna be passed which brings up another

485
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,140
thing which is really interesting for
those of us who enterprise sec you'll

486
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,029
often find guys saying you don't
understand this is the problem or in

487
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:52,279
this organization this precludes that
and we keep talking about these

488
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:59,400
obstacles as if they just happened to be
there that's the job like the reason the

489
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,289
obstacles are day is the reason you have
a job

490
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:07,420
your job is to make it secured despite
those obstacles we can't keep waiting

491
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,329
for the day those obstacles are gone and
then will magically secure stuff we have

492
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:17,660
to find ways to secure stuff despite all
of those obstacles and the use of

493
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:23,670
excuses becomes dangerous because right
now we heading for the perfect storm

494
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,970
things are getting more complex and
we've kind of bought ourselves a get out

495
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:33,180
of jail free card either the board
doesn't listen this is complex or you

496
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,890
don't understand the organization blah
blah blah and one of the things I can

497
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,879
understand is for people who pride
themselves on social engineering how we

498
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,430
can still go saying the management don't
get it on the board don't get it that's

499
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:56,788
a long-term social engineering exercise
ok your job is to make them get it and

500
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:00,859
if you can't make them get it and and
this is going to sound slightly harsh

501
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:06,249
but if if you a cecil if you wake up in
the oil change and you can't make your

502
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:12,049
board get it you should change jobs
because either dead bodies never gonna

503
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:16,210
get it for you never gonna get through
but either way staying there when you

504
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,180
can convince them like this it's kind of
do your stuff or get off the pot give

505
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,690
someone else a shot

506
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:29,230
ok because it needs to happen and in
truth most of the time we just end up

507
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:34,109
being distracted by shiny things ok we
start doing stuff and shiny stuff

508
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:39,489
distracts us I'm going to blitz through
some of these really quickly

509
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:44,259
some of these were just distractions
that I think we give into way too often

510
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:50,960
disclosure debates resurfaced almost
every six months like clockwork kind of

511
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,009
brings up the xkcd someone's wrong on
the internet and we all gonna tell them

512
00:42:55,009 --> 00:43:00,119
why what's interesting about the latest
round of disclosure debates is it all

513
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,539
seemed almost perfectly reversed if
you've been watching it over a few years

514
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:09,099
suddenly everyone hates Google project
zero and one of the reasons that come

515
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:14,230
down when you dig into it is man those
guys are arrogant ok and if you go away

516
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:21,480
back you'll find a loved one go to an
article in security focus like in 99 or

517
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,480
2000 and he was talking about the fact
that everyone disliked full disclosure

518
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,539
because I were doing it and I had purple
here

519
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:35,770
okay we've kind of gone the same way in
15 years and not made much progress

520
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:43,310
what I do want to touch on is unhealthy
obsession 10 day and exploits ok because

521
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:48,250
there's a lot of it like as an industry
we ship to show is it real ionized it

522
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,690
and most people will tell you for those
of you are doing pin testing you owning

523
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:57,320
networks with out using zero day ok
networks are getting compromised without

524
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:03,250
it but we're so focused on it for so
long and we shouldn't be surprised when

525
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,390
that's the first thing to get regulated

526
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:13,310
one of the things that are interesting
in terms of zero day is a question that

527
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,200
I asked once before and again it's just
a reminder of how little we've

528
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,430
accomplished so I sent a message out to
a whole bunch of my friends are guys

529
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,870
have been pinned testing for a long time
guys who are consulting and I said take

530
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:33,220
your top customers assume I've got a 90
day how many 0 day would it take me to

531
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:39,689
give you the worst day of your life and
almost perfectly routinely the answer is

532
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,490
one less than 10 K

533
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,149
we're not even forcing days to go to two
or three and this is what network

534
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:53,460
segmentation this is stuff that forget
we should have learned twenty years ago

535
00:44:53,460 --> 00:45:01,880
this is Sultan shoulder stuff which is
ancient and one of the downsides of zero

536
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,180
day and I'll obsession with it is it's
given us a modern version off in the

537
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:12,850
West they used to have the golden rule
has the gold makes the rules these days

538
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:17,920
we've got a version of that that's like
20 deal like as long as you reduce your

539
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,630
day your case it doesn't matter if you
doing filed stuff it doesn't matter if

540
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,890
you doing stuff that endangers people 0
day makes it all ok and it's something

541
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,629
we need to consider

542
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:35,490
so really quickly security conferences
once again this whole thing was just a

543
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:41,259
plot for me to get you to watch some of
all the talks we talk about this

544
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,490
called a talk about talks because
there's a security conference going on

545
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,368
now for almost every day of the year

546
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:54,190
ok and we picked on a lot of things in
that talk a lot of things that we think

547
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,960
should be done differently and almost
everyone thinks that we gonna hold in on

548
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,759
stun takin' ok but surprisingly I don't
have that much of a problem with some

549
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:09,130
taking I think it's reasonably okay for
the most part I have a problem with the

550
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,999
fact that we've made it a passive
exercise for the audience ok you see

551
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:19,279
entire crowds now go to conferences go
through the motions may be at lunch time

552
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:25,499
take a lot beginning exercise or taking
exercise on how to be a deejay for some

553
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:32,618
reason that's closely tied to security
conferences but ultimately come out of

554
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,140
it with nothing

555
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,328
okay and you can still check the site
you can track it for talks that was

556
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:43,569
super high P I've used the example
before but there was a lot of hype few

557
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:48,019
years back when John outcall scar said
that she would make an undetectable

558
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:55,529
hypervisor via a show of hands off you
remember that incident ok a lot of fans

559
00:46:55,529 --> 00:47:05,079
who can tell me what was the outcome
from that could she like this is pretty

560
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,299
by anady all that hype went into that
talk we don't know whether the takeaway

561
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:15,109
was yes you can both an invisible
hypervisor view more no you can't what

562
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:17,720
did we take from that whole exercise

563
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,730
give a talk on exploding Mac batteries

564
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:27,859
well that's what the slides it who can
tell me what was the end result ok and

565
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:31,489
again we've got to ask ourselves like
what are we doing it's cool to go to

566
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:34,980
those places it's cool that those guys
are doing the research what are we

567
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,950
taking away from it

568
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:44,339
Jacob study had a really good post on
conferences and essentially he said he

569
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:48,499
broke stuff down into two types of
problems he said you have chess problems

570
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:54,098
and polka problems and he said that us
as researchers like the chess problems

571
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:58,359
it's the one where you start with a
hypothetical situation and then you do

572
00:47:58,359 --> 00:47:59,890
some technical coolness

573
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,618
to get a result it's mentally
challenging it's what we all want to do

574
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,609
I says actually people are getting
burned in the real world by poker

575
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:14,799
problems with people are not playing the
game they playing the men so there's

576
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:19,529
really simple problems that we consider
solved that are really hurting a whole

577
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:25,490
bunch of people and essentially what he
said is this gap is gonna keep growing

578
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:31,220
ok and what it set to do is make us as
researchers is relevant and it's

579
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,950
something it said because we are the
ones in a position

580
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,129
most to help people and we don't just do
it with conferences like we do it with a

581
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:45,059
lot of stuff social friends again how
many of you have seen the mock download

582
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:51,539
it drop stuff now you guys are just why
is to this whole show of hands thing so

583
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:58,299
recently mocked announced a bug in iOS
ok which allowed you to attack the phone

584
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:05,730
using big news for Forbes article all of
that show of hands how many of you know

585
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:18,210
what beyond Corp is anyone ok one person
do you want to Google yes ok so beyond

586
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:23,490
Corp is a Google initiative and it's
actually kind of cool for those of you

587
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:28,288
who've been awhile it's what the general
Kofi Annan wanted to be but they

588
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:32,190
actually doing it which is they've
completely deeper into that is the

589
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,970
network ok and they've got some
technical ways on how it can be done and

590
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,879
obviously the Google but they should be
using the salt this is not a kind of

591
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,349
idea Google would run the entire
internal network like it's an external

592
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:52,500
network okay and you can see the
possibilities for it right because right

593
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,460
now we can trust lots of stuff on our
network anyway but what I'm more

594
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,579
interested in is the fact that none of
us have focused on that even though that

595
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:06,799
came out in 2014 ok that's something
that is real and tangible you could help

596
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:10,860
organizations but that's the stuff that
just disappears

597
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,750
so I'm not gonna ask you to raise your
hands

598
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:19,870
question how many of us in this room
identify as security researchers just to

599
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:24,490
add insult to injury I'm gonna throw in
a talk from allen key I wish you guys

600
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:30,109
ever get a chance to watch and LMK talk
on YouTube do it on the one hand it

601
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,250
makes you smarter just by having it
plays in the background on the other

602
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,450
hand it's really embarrasses you about
how little we've accomplished so he gave

603
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:43,490
a talk called the power of simplicity
and he was talking about what they

604
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:49,100
accomplished at Xerox PARC and he went
through it and essentially said the

605
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:55,920
personal computer the goal we will see
wig laser printer PostScript Ethernet

606
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,220
networking and about half of the
internet ok and what's surprising is he

607
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:08,330
says they did that with 25 researchers
and he says it was what the today cost

608
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,529
of twelve million dollars per year

609
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:16,510
ok and like I said this is literally
just to make us feel bad we've gotten

610
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,360
more than 25 security researchers in
this room we haven't figured out how to

611
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:27,560
secure PHP web applications yet okay and
yeah we need to figure out what's going

612
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:33,090
wrong there so the last section really
quickly I think we missing some key

613
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,440
opportunities

614
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:42,020
one of them is we had such a bad
position that we can view look at almost

615
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,700
everything like right now we saw bed we
should be able to try lots of stuff

616
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,390
because we can't make it much worse like
we should be able to go completely blue

617
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:56,890
sky like maybe patching servers doesn't
matter anymore like maybe we never have

618
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,620
to petrol internal servers we're not
going to be much worse off than we

619
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:06,549
currently maybe we don't need passwords
maybe we need a new way to calculate

620
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:11,200
risk maybe we do what beyond co-op is
doing an open your internet or your

621
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,970
instant your internal network to the
whole world it's actually an opportunity

622
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:21,750
the low bar gives us gives us room the
other thing that's interesting is cheap

623
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:28,920
packs in defense still win a few here
have done a Pinterest will you got

624
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,500
domain admin on the network

625
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:38,920
ok I'm guessing whole bunch of you on
your company network would know if a new

626
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:48,050
user was added to the domain admin group
ok we've got fuel own hands

627
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,700
this is a super simple thing like this
doesn't need anything massive its two

628
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,379
lines of PowerShell that you don't even
need domain admin to run and it will

629
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:03,220
tell you when a new user became the main
admin it would have uncovered

630
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,939
hack it might have helped with Sony

631
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,020
the stuff is super simple and there's
lots of little things like this that can

632
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,780
be done

633
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,100
you go through your phone logs and you
can see pretty quickly when bad this is

634
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,660
happening you can see you can write a
Python script that will tell you bob is

635
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,250
logging in from two locations at the
same time

636
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:30,050
ok you know you've got a problem wolves
logging in from multiple countries in

637
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,790
the same day and you know you've got a
problem but it's stuff that we just

638
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:41,790
doing so dearly quickly Alex Thomas says
what we need to be doing is building

639
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:46,290
tools he makes it very clear he's well
this was when he was at yahoo has since

640
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,180
moved he says that most box software
that they can get doesn't work for them

641
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:58,440
and I'm saying this isn't just the table
he thought it was because of Yahoo's

642
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,770
scale and I'm saying the music is more
than that it's because genetics software

643
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:08,960
security solutions almost never work and
what you need to be doing is customizing

644
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,970
or building tools for your own
organization and the good thing is

645
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:19,640
nobody currently owns this thing this
base in Hillah to do coolness this space

646
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:26,850
to build stuff but in terms of boosting
stuff building stuff is hot it's hard to

647
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,930
go from the tiny script that you've
gotten to an actual product

648
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:35,980
but I think there's a hot a problem that
we as security consultants face and

649
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:41,230
that's the fact that it's hard to go
from being always invite consultants to

650
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:46,280
building stuff that then gets judged ok
because when you'll consultant you walk

651
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,680
in and you just about always a tight
anything that the guy says you've got a

652
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,919
good ensemble and when you've got a
product the guy gets to tell you that

653
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,589
the button is blue any really prefers it
read but we can't do any worse than it

654
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:04,509
currently is and we can keep complaining
that vendors and this we willing to

655
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:10,380
throw a hat in the ring and give it a
try ourselves so really quickly in

656
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:20,970
somebody that's really important
inflection point ok this big trouble on

657
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:26,089
the horizon and increasingly people
don't trust us we simultaneously face a

658
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,700
crisis of relevance and a crisis of
confidence

659
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:35,089
ok not sure how we manage to pull that
off all coming trajectory leads us

660
00:55:35,089 --> 00:55:41,549
straight to disaster if we do nothing to
change this it's gonna end up in fail

661
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:46,980
step one is just to acknowledge this ok
I think at some point we've just got to

662
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:52,880
say okay but right now we know horrible
position and we need to do stuff to fix

663
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:59,790
it if you are defending my advice for my
one takeaway would be make sure that the

664
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,829
stuff that you aiming at matters if
there's one thing that I've seen from

665
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:08,460
most organizations doing defense wrong
it's that a lot of them are spending

666
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,130
lots of time with busy work that doesn't
matter

667
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:16,549
damn guess is it really nicely when he
says you should be asking yourself if

668
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:17,809
what you doing

669
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:22,599
makes the disputed different to the
patience to the patient ok and a lot of

670
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:28,880
what we doing I think isn't if UN attack
you should realize that there's a bunch

671
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,260
of interesting stuff to do on the
defensive side attacked his old joined

672
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,589
other side this coolness there if you
would be such a DVD clear I'm not

673
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:42,130
sleeping offensive research

674
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:47,359
it's totally important but one of the
things we need to figure out is what we

675
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,640
do has repercussions ok an increasingly
these days you're starting to see some

676
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,210
of the geopolitical repercussions of the
stuff we work on a Marcus Ranum has a

677
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,630
nice life he says

678
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:03,309
friends don't let friends vote prison ok
and it's it's something for us to

679
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:08,480
consider if you are researcher we need
you to show up and choose a site

680
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,529
essentially to throw your hat in the
ring because right now we need it

681
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:16,500
desperately

682
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:28,010
that's all I've got

683
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:38,020
questions but I'll be out on afterwards
and you can spare me @ hotmail.com or

684
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:43,740
treat at me to tell me why I'm stupid
and I'll try to respond to thank you

685
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:43,939
guess
