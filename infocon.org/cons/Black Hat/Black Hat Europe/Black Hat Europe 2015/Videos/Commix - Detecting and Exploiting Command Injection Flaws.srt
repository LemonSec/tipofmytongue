1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,779
thank you all for being here today let's
talk about 25 minutes I'm gonna show you

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,290
how you can easily find and exploit
combined action close on web

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:21,789
applications using comics how many of
you know what is that ok let's get that

4
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:30,390
is where my embrace currently maybe the
candidate at the University of pillows

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,000
Department of Health Systems emotion
member of system security laboratory at

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the same department and then another I'm
a builder and breaking of stuff I

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,379
suppose that most of you know what does
a combined action on the dock for those

8
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,239
who don't I would like to mention that
according to the over command actions

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,879
and attack in which the goal is the
execution no comment on the bidding

10
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,430
system through a valuable application
and commands action is notified that

11
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,659
they need to make sure no a suggestion
that disposable one application for

12
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,380
example a web based application biases
unsafe you just upload data such as for

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,369
me because there's missus themselves and
I would like to note here that the

14
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,240
attack a couple a debating system
command executed with the same

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:31,649
permission of the available application
I know that many of you may be wondering

16
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,390
if combined actions are still alive and
the answer is yes

17
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,280
injections are able to work for example
on web application a dissenter heart out

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,600
there's cameras network printers IP PBX
applications and asked me to buy based

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,130
web applications so I don't know are
doing a bail applications everywhere but

20
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,920
why why are still alive

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,780
tax debate exhibit independent come to
cure in multiple operating systems such

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,780
as Windows Linux UNIX etc as well as
program

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,709
independent mayor cute and application
written in violent programming languages

24
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:23,610
such as C C++ Java whatever or web based
applications in web application

25
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:33,060
frameworks such as by John go to do
whatever ok but what causes combined

26
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,750
action follows the main reason that an
obligation to command section of tax is

27
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,600
you don't correct or complete like a
violation for example the following

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:55,000
piece of code get an IP address so they
get a Dr parameter another that actually

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,190
killed a man and echoes the result of
execution I think it's a there's no one

30
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,329
here which means that if someone shoots
somebody took for example the same ago

31
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:16,720
and now they're operating system command
such as less both of them will be

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,500
executed the one after the other and
usually with the same privileges exactly

33
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:31,090
like like himself again during our
research we analyzed and categorized

34
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,290
commands action attacks in two
categories

35
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,250
the main to our base commander actions
in a way to the publication output there

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,799
is a direct command

37
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,190
undertaking further if the application
is if the combined action to succeed or

38
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:56,239
not and of course they did results are
visible the second category includes

39
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,769
blank among directions in which the
vulnerable obligation does not outweigh

40
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,690
the result of the inject command even if
they aren't I can inject an arbitrary

41
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,750
comment on the host operating system the
results will not be shown in the screen

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,560
and of course they dictionary results
are not let sit exams

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:25,680
the first one is the same as previously
if someone puts an IP address here or if

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,520
someone shoots and IP address another
and another buddy system come on they

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:42,240
diction results are visible but what is
the case off the black community actions

46
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:51,490
as you can see there is no any echo at
the start which means that if someone

47
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:58,300
wants to sort of someone who is this
enough to that end another operating

48
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:07,650
system command the execution result is
not visible so in order to see we have

49
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,280
to be blamed

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,150
case and I would like to introduce you
the time based blind mechanic this

51
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,130
technique is based on time delays we are
back at the conference room they there

52
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:27,860
is out the finding command firstly it
decide if the application is vulnerable

53
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:35,640
to time-based command actions for
example by using the following a load it

54
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,890
echoes randomly selected six correct
history and if the length of that swing

55
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,870
is found to be six then it slips for one
second after that it determines the

56
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:55,950
length of the output of inject command
exactly the same way as previously and

57
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,760
not sure that it exports terabytes the
output of indirect command using its

58
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,840
operating system commands for example in
the IRA but the logic is the same

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:19,219
amazing time delays another technique
that I would like to introduce you say

60
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,480
me blind

61
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,320
is based on a very basic idea if we are
not able to see that is out the

62
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,890
execution of convicted come on we're
gonna ride them to file which is

63
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:42,390
accessible by us by example but what if
webservice root directory for example

64
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:53,250
virus / ewww / HTML is not writable are
accessible by then we can use temporary

65
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:00,860
directories the MB or MB to start a
fight we we've been with the output of a

66
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,730
direct command

67
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,430
condition here is that usually we got to
read fives located in to this tomorrow

68
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,800
today directories through the web
application show in order to bypass that

69
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,330
limitation would apply the time being in
order to read the contents of that file

70
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:31,080
and the combination of file-based and
time-based is a different technique for

71
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,950
those who don't know what it is

72
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:39,070
comics is a short for command injection
exploder and is a software tool that

73
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,849
helps us in order to find and exploit
combined action flash on web application

74
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:55,110
is available when get up this is coexist
with a highly entertaining python is a

75
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,020
cross-platform application supports
Linux Mac OS and Windows operating

76
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,950
systems and of course are free and open
source software installation is very

77
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:13,190
easy you can download cloning they get
him or if you are using one of the

78
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,090
following

79
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,530
Linux distributions you can use the
official market manager and I would like

80
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:26,559
to note here that since yesterday go mix
is available in Linux

81
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,309
and comic so shocked to plug in on the
following penetration testing frameworks

82
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:46,540
for patients like a supports management
techniques combined sections it supports

83
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,069
ok the classic adult basic commands
action technique their dynamical

84
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,110
evaluation technique aka eval based
technique which is based on evidence

85
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:05,720
executioners out output but also
supports regulations actions you started

86
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,400
directions patient injection is the
ideal place in sections and fragments

87
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:19,360
injections actions and support of course
the time based technique which is the

88
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,580
blank Nick the file based technique the
semi blind and the combination of two

89
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,370
that empire based technique but referred
to this technique in detail previously

90
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:37,640
usual we have to move on the other girl
picture comics is divided into three

91
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,689
main modules the first one is that a
collector generator which generates a

92
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:49,520
set of commands action attacked by
collectors using a separate release that

93
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,220
list includes mention by a semicolon
ampersand pipe newline at end of the

94
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,310
second module performance combined
action to the target host using the

95
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:11,430
dedicated to 20 of those from the
previous more June and that they had 16

96
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,500
vacation mode it does them say they
shown procedure if it determines that

97
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:30,030
the application or the host is
vulnerable to come and diction it is I

98
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:37,040
was based on my injection should come
experience free time generating strength

99
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,760
combined with a result of calculation of
two randomly selected numbers for

100
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,790
example for example something like lot
and that my steak house in response the

101
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,430
union of the strings with a result of
the month calculation like I inside the

102
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:03,199
premises and regarding blank among
sections yet is a high probability of

103
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,250
phones pose it did you do random or
accidental response delays or federal

104
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,210
get Coast that's why comics com comics
calculate the other at this point the

105
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:21,260
name of the target host like that but I
think that you can t the average

106
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,000
response time is up to the default delay
time which is used to perform time based

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,370
tax according to wait there is comics
allow us to provide our own it to be

108
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,780
there for example

109
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:47,910
raisin cookies her extra appeared there
so whatever and not to support command

110
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:56,750
actions through all of these never
described technique this figure shows us

111
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,320
and diction

112
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:08,030
the user agent and Malaysia no chance
that can be used in under in order to

113
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,439
enumerate the target host and retrieve
information charges current username

114
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,260
current host name to take a village or
not

115
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,460
to retrieve system information such as
operating system and hardware platform

116
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:29,280
system users least system user's
privilege this end system user password

117
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,280
crisis likely only be stationed here is
that they discuss how to file must be my

118
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:43,270
current user and if someone gets
together that is out would be like that

119
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:54,270
figure in order to bypass target host
bus limitations it could be restriction

120
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,699
of Commons for example gotta go ahead I
don't know all the IRA whatever

121
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:12,380
supports excels at this moment only by
whenever he described technique but my

122
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:21,380
future is to create more alternative
sales for example PHP or Ruby if you

123
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:29,650
want to take that you can download the
persistence and exploded using but

124
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:40,449
option as you can see the payload is
owned by home so that's why it bypasses

125
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:50,090
the distinctions based on bus will have
said that's why comics reports net cut

126
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:55,710
reversals network without negative
ourselves if you want to share how you

127
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,810
can use them to lose weight which
includes several test cases and

128
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:11,099
scenarios but if you want to write or
upload your own website for example the

129
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,850
reversal or we believe it's been a
website or i don't know exists yours for

130
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,880
can commit

131
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,050
you can use file access options and if
you want to see how you can reuse them

132
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:33,500
so we upload century debates here are
jewish else in action

133
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:47,390
the first and the second line and then
it got support two main modules the

134
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:53,360
first line is the ESN pigmentation and
designed to provide a set of component

135
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,050
to receive and store files actually
traded actually traded over ICMP echo

136
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:05,859
request packets if you want to take that
modern go and check again

137
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:19,190
position 2 p.m. and of course they sent
up more June affect my ability and if

138
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,910
you want to increase the capability of
comics and are adapted to your needs you

139
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:31,380
can develop an easy import your own
scripts it's very easy if you want to

140
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,820
see how you can do it

141
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:44,230
technology development which paints and
you're ok during the evaluation we used

142
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:53,350
mainly by the number of applications in
order to see

143
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:05,030
which includes many vulnerable web
applications in many scenarios so if you

144
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:14,770
want to take it downloaded from github
is free and available and moreover

145
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:27,610
during our research we discovered 20
days in both of them there's no end

146
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,170
there is not any input data validation

147
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:42,410
the first one was not worth what plugin
apply again that helps us to manage our

148
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:54,160
own project using ground the violence of
the ability is here

149
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:08,869
opposed by the second day is made known
semis technology application to

150
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:18,239
application which contains the same cell
but as you can

151
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,720
may not see their multiple viewpoints on
that go and I would like to note here

152
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:38,450
that vendors have already been important
by always except for all your requests

153
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,640
for stars on developing its gonna be an
issue I would really appreciate

154
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,730
reports do with logs and changements you
know how I can improve for you or

155
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:00,520
description of how you can use it and I
think we have time to share one or two

156
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:20,730
them was ok

157
00:18:20,730 --> 00:19:04,559
to get all requests and to use them

158
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:37,990
have to put the URL

159
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,320
yeah

160
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,679
based here

161
00:19:49,680 --> 00:20:10,470
I don't know how

162
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:25,940
in order to connect to the admin panel
this is

163
00:20:25,940 --> 00:21:32,290
yes yeah it should the terminal cell but
it works

164
00:21:32,290 --> 00:22:21,350
exactly

165
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:41,559
we would like to take four injections ok
with you

166
00:22:41,559 --> 00:23:28,250
weekend is here flags for information
such as current users hostname shameful

167
00:23:28,250 --> 00:25:48,639
you name it

168
00:25:48,640 --> 00:26:40,970
I would like to tomorrow I will be there

169
00:26:40,970 --> 00:27:00,340
of the output ok but if you want to move
on you can use an alternative not a love

170
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:29,830
story and that cuts lol another cell
which is much more is based on 22

171
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,030
capping the first one is results based
in the second one is blind

172
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:50,389
this is a completely blind

173
00:27:50,390 --> 00:28:13,050
but you can see you can predict the
result by scanning terabytes are for

174
00:28:13,050 --> 00:29:11,820
example I would love an example but and
to add this injection

175
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:55,490
because many times because not only one
another
