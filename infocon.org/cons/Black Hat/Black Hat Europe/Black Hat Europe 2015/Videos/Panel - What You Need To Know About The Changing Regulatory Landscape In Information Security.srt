1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:08,510
good morning everyone thanks for being
here the panel will soon start is going

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,170
to be around two main topics the first
one is a quick recap of where we are at

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,920
with dual use regulation but the main
topic dad would like to come over here

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,310
is what have we learned from this
experience both with the European Union

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:30,359
and partially with the bus nor agreement
journal and how can we work together

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,649
better with the government's and also
under civil societies my bird like

there just to go through the Bayou first

10
00:00:52,569 --> 00:01:00,479
and then we'll show a brief video from
its shocking and then we'll start with

11

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,590
the world including you and University
of North colourings

40
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:13,850
then we dr. Richard Beynon richard is a
technologist our Privacy International

41
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,108
with a specific focus in on the area of
surveillance technology focuses on wired

42
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,070
and wireless surveillance mechanism and
destroyed two just employed by

43
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,560
cybercriminals to harvest belt verbal
private information for a wide range of

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,290
ubiquitous devices such as such as cell
phones and personal computers

45
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,790
reach our goals are first-class owner or
BSc degree and a PHD new industries and

46
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,510
are to be artificial intelligence for
embedded sensor network from the

47
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,900
University College of doubling and was
also completed upgrade your mind low

48
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,429
then the last person we have on the
panel is thomas de un horario flake

49
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,780
depending on what are you attending
black cat for more than five years of

50
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:05,750
not so used to run a company called
dynamics the company used to build the

51
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,270
reverse engineering tools company got
acquired by Google opted to go down and

52
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,130
cups period thomas' on a year-long
sabbatical trying to learn to assert

53
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:24,169
myself I am on the Review Board of
bucket which I guess is the main reason

54
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,960
why I'm here and I'm going to moderate a
panel for the most part so the first

55
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,580
thing I want to do is to show my PJs she
was really kind

56
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,400
member of the European Parliament with
the Dutch Democratic Party

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,690
we're part of the alliance of liberals
and Democrats for Europe and as you're

58
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,710
watching this all be in Brazil to attend
the Internet Governance Forum and that's

59
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,349
why I could not participate in the black
hat sessions in person this year but I'm

60
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,370
happy I can share some of my faults with
you through this video in the European

61
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,840
Parliament's I serve on the committees
for Foreign Affairs international trade

62
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,219
and human rights and I've been actively
working on the reform of the EU dual use

63
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,680
regulation but also on the EU export
control regimes it is often said that

64
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,740
politicians don't know much about
technology and that's probably true and

65
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,850
general some don't know the difference
between a server in a waiter but I would

66
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,140
also ask the question to you how much do
security researchers know about politics

67
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,909
and law making I welcome the opportunity
to exchange ideas between the world of

68
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,230
technology and politics so let me begin
by clarifying some misunderstandings on

69
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,960
what the EU plans to do and what the
intention is behind the rear view of the

70
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,450
dual use regulation and how all of this
affect the work of information security

71
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:15,070
researchers at the whole community
firstly in none of my efforts would I

72
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,790
want to stifle the work of independent
security researchers have consistently

73
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,930
said this throughout the years that I've
been working on Jul using other export

74
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,000
controls have also made it clear in the
reports that have been adopted by

75
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,990
Parliament secondly I do not want to bet
the trade in 20 days by using the review

76
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,400
of the use Export Control Policy this
has never been the intention of the

77
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,020
review process of the dual use
regulation nor our export controls the

78
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,010
ideal way to regulate the sales of 0
days this was very clear and an event

79
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,890
that I organized last month in the
European Parliament's enrichment gentle

80
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,099
and also other security experts spoke
representatives from the European

81
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,060
Commission from NGOs and the European
Parliament I thought it was a good and

82
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,020
lively debate

83
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,530
but to be clear it doesn't mean that I
think we should leave the regulation of

84
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,280
this market entirely up to industry
states and governments have the duty to

85
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
secure citizens and their rights

86
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,239
online and offline and certain aspects
of the trade in 20 days cannot be left

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,419
on regulated in the future the EU could
look for instance into coordinated

88
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,628
disclosure initiatives as a remedy
against the abuse of software

89
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:34,209
vulnerabilities and data breaches this
is now a discussion but there are no

90
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,619
specific policy proposals on the table
what is being discussed is that UN

91
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,170
Rights considerations should be playing
a larger role in the decision process of

92
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:51,569
Export Control authorities on whether or
not to grant licenses until now you need

93
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,060
a license if you want to export goods
outside the EU that could be used to the

94
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,750
detriment of the EU security for example
groups that could be used to make a

95
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,640
nuclear bomb

96
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,079
survey and is hacking intrusion an
actual tration systems are relatively

97
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,589
new addition here that use policy needs
to be reformed in order to ensure that

98
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:17,290
certain dual-use items including
ready-made surveillance systems are not

99
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,240
marketed designed and sold to
authoritarianism regimes this you can

100
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,399
use them to spy on journalists human
rights defenders are opposition figures

101
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,370
and you're right should be added in the
EU regulation as an extra control

102
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:38,980
criteria but in the absence of the right
regulations that use credibility as a

103
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,440
foreign policy actor is severely damaged
we cannot criticize human rights

104
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,060
violations in which make a strong russia
or soda while we continue to allow

105
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,260
European companies to sell the same
technologies that enable these very

106
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,610
human rights violations in the first
place

107
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,800
another important element of this review
process for me is to get more

108
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,510
transparency effectiveness and coherence
in are you export control system

109
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,530
currently it is not very clear which you
country stops what type of good and

110
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,760
there's no uniform interpretation of the
EU rules and this needs to change we

111
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,460
also need to make sure that the rules
are uniformly applied and that we have a

112
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,900
level playing field and effective
controls to make sure that we target

113
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,030
wrongdoing and not legitimate activities
I focus on the trade transactions and

114
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,689
the context within which systems will be
used not only on the technological

115
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,720
specifications on my website you can
find twelve concrete actions to remedy

116
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,190
human rights shortcomings in de use dual
use regulation but for the purpose of

117
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,700
today's event I will only focus on for a
first I suggest that the Commission

118
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,090
should set up and provide so-called know
your customer guidelines that give

119
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,940
instructions to companies to assess
whether their dual use items including

120
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,210
intrusion software may be used for
internal repression or human rights

121
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,420
abuses these guidelines can consist of a
checklist of flagging criteria that

122
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,560
could indicate potentially suspicious
transactions and on this basis companies

123
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,349
can assess the possibility that their
products may be used to violate human

124
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,100
rights before the sale is actually
completed and commissioned in turn

125
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,620
should monitor enforcement of these know
your customer rules of whistleblower

126
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,170
protection should be offered to
employees of exporters that report

127
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,349
noncompliance second I suggest that the
Commission should be able to swiftly

128
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,800
provide companies that are in doubt as
to whether to apply for a license or not

129
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,319
with accurate and up-to-date information
on the legality or the potentially

130
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,620
harmful effects of their future
transactions to this end the company

131
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,930
helped us should be shut up we should
closely age with EU member state export

132
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,189
control authorities to provide companies
with the necessary information with

133
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,120
third issue focuses on modifying the
definition of intrusion software as a

134
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,100
controlled good in the EU export control
regulation I'm very much aware that

135
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,200
there have been a lot of concerns about
this specific definition especially

136
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,900
because there exists a varying degree of
interpretation of which definitions

137
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,230
cover what technologies in national
implementation machines all of the

138
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,680
Boston arrangements in order to remove
the unintended chilling effects that

139
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,150
this conclusion could have on the work
of security researchers the Commission

140
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,520
should clarify that the scope of control
of the development of intrusion software

141
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,780
applies only to end jews cases and end
users facilitating or conducting

142
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,449
surveillance and other human rights
violating activities my last proposed

143
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,390
action that all mentioned today is that
I called the Commission and the relevant

144
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,920
export control authorities in the EU
member states to engage in a permanent

145
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,459
dialogue with security researchers and
appropriate framework for this is the

146
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,210
surveillance technology working group
within betrayed the dual-use working

147
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,990
group while controlling the export of
technology to prevent human rights

148
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,030
abuses is essential

149
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,189
export controls should never hindered
the legitimate transfer of technology

150
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:33,160
which can be used to protect human
rights or that are used for research now

151
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,209
since I know that you appreciate clear
language here at black hat I will add

152
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,060
one more thing to my list of
recommendations and that is that the

153
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,880
information security community needs to
get its act together right now in

154
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,120
Brussels so-called cyber security
community consists of large companies

155
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,260
whose interests aren't always aligned
with what a number of you may want to

156
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,250
individually and I know that there is
not one uniform opinion in the research

157
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,820
community either but if you want to
prevent unintended effects of

158
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,410
legislation it helps to be a part of
shaping it in a constructive and active

159
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,060
and your technical expertise is needed
even if it is impossible for everyone to

160
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,279
agree at the end I hope this
introduction and

161
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,370
some of my points will be to a lively
discussion and I really look forward to

162
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,639
learning more about what came out of
your conference today thank you hope to

163
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:42,259
see you in person ok so as I mentioned
at the beginning of the panel we have to

164
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:46,920
go see are the first one is to a brief
preview of what we've learned so far and

165
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,459
sort of like understand where we are in
terms of regulation but then the main

166
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:57,099
the main goal here is to stay to figure
out what to do in the future and send

167
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,309
out to work better with the institutions
and civil society so I'll give you a

168
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:08,550
very very brief recap of where we are
with this meaningful use regulation so

169
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,089
there was a consultation period with the
European Commission that ended on

170
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:21,019
October 15 the commission is supposed to
come up with a proposal by the end of

171
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,459
2012 2016 for Parliament

172
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:30,199
the proposal will be discussed within
the parliament by the European

173
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,529
Commission the real be command
amendments actually

174
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:43,230
and after that there will be a boat then
it will go through a discussion in the

175
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,589
council discussion between the
Parliament and the council and then

176
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:55,399
assuming all of this works out the dual
use regulation will be replaced now 11 I

177
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,279
think there is important to understand
about dual use regulations that it's not

178
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,959
about is not just about intrusions after
the main goal here is to sort of like

179
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:12,209
shipped or at least the main goal of
some of the actors involved in the

180
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:18,768
regulation is to think and shipped
potentially get yelled at

181
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:25,589
told you should just be about national
security and include the concept that

182
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,220
drove you should also be about human
rights

183
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,089
your thing I want to say really briefly
is that there's been a lot of confusion

184
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:38,360
between what's going on in Europe and
what's going on with us and our Boston R

185
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,179
and dysregulation are not related
European Union has no bearing in

186
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:51,269
blockbuster decides bison are is a group
forty-one countries where you have

187
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:58,600
members of each individual country
country usually equivalent of the DoD or

188
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,999
ministry of defence and discuss topics
are sensitive in terms of national

189
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,149
security

190
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:10,178
what happened here is that the timing
was not great and so does bus and I was

191
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,909
being implemented also the door user
review happened and that and that's why

192
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:20,230
there has been a mix-up in terms of
their role of the european union with

193
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:28,960
the summer so I'd like to pick up the
panel with one I think the main the main

194
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,740
topic dad miss truck which is do we do
we think that human rights should play a

195
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,419
role in the regulation of cybersecurity
or should it just be about national

196
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:53,740
security and commercial interests with
rich in this so one of the things in

197
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,010
addition to the Human Rights analysis
seems to come a little bit after many of

198
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,919
the controversial measures so at least
in the UK and many of the other EU

199
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:13,580
states a technology that meets a certain
definition would then it was to be

200
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,260
exported and exported along the lines of
either an actual transfer of code or the

201
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,110
transfer of knowledge so for example
teaching somebody about intrusion

202
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,918
software things like that they'll be
calling deemed exporter and Thunderbolt

203
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,960
technology transfer and its I think the
question that we're asking here is not

204
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:39,419
whether I dot should inform the election
in form after somebody has applied for a

205
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:45,570
an export license and I guess a lot of
the the the main push back as being from

206
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:52,200
the fact that many of the technologies
need to circulate freely to improve

207
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,990
security may now be caught which would
potentially require individuals to even

208
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,529
as marriages even if if if breached
problem was correct even pick up the

209
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:11,270
phone and call their government and I'm
not sure that that is the right process

210
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,470
where an individual who's who's playing
around with stuff and find something and

211
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,399
once to disclose that would need to in
effect get permission from the

212
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:27,110
government ID I guess just another
clarification are we talking about human

213
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:33,270
rights in respect of informing goes into
a cenar and the usual use or as a human

214
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,270
rights respected the decision of the
Export Control authorities that whether

215
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,580
to grant the license in the first place
so I was thinking about it more in broad

216
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,699
terms meaning in general we eventually
and it's something already cybersecurity

217
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,049
will be a little more and more and a lot
of us we do in this field

218
00:19:54,049 --> 00:20:00,679
top potentially be used for human rights
by should when it comes to regulation

219
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,919
should that play a role in your opinion
or not and i think absolutely should

220
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,120
play a role however I don't think
firstly I don't think 0 days and I'd

221
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,949
like to understand from reaching what
she means by regulating part of the zero

222
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,760
day market

223
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,970
and what that actually means because I'm
not sure any regulation and the

224
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:29,670
respective example proof of concepts
vulnerability disclosure I'm not sure

225
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:36,620
how that would encourage or facilitate
the free flow of one bit and he's to the

226
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,379
people who need to actually know them if
there is this barrier to apply for a

227
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,660
license for its export it comes what's
what's your take on this

228
00:20:45,660 --> 00:21:16,470
hadn't been used to sell something that
is going to be technology very quickly

229
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,710
and up with everything being somewhat at
least almost definitional being able to

230
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:29,640
be used today and so we go up everybody
knows Oracle was you say so

231
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:39,610
is an SQL database inherently something
will be generalized to try to use

232
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:46,530
regulation order to encourage but very
very difficult 10 little bit too

233
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:54,200
responsible for industry companies
commonly called the government is caused

234
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,120
these all political stage

235
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:06,459
well dominant disorder in voting by
something really complicated questions

236
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:16,860
in this paper cards regulation happens
when you see a very slow and then into

237
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:24,409
the consultation with people whom you
speak for regulating $100

238
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,090
attention and only trying to limit the
fall

239
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:37,920
yeah I mean what especially from again
to talk about this shocking proposal

240
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,990
because my struggles don't you know but
one thing that I've seen repeated over

241
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,450
and over again is this idea of trying to
AB controls like know your customers and

242
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:56,530
and a problem like it seems to me that
one of those being done in terms of

243
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:03,080
regulating the sector in general is to
have very similar regulation to do in

244
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,220
cyber security that we see in finance
and a problem is that we will have the

245
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,330
same album set me up there so we will
see a lot of HSBC laundering money for

246
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,689
some Mexican cartel you'll see a lot of
some persecutor thinking that one thing

247
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,660
is insider trading what it's actually
not on sports so I think that that is

248
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,830
just shifting the problem and I think
the one thing that we as an industry and

249
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,850
doesn't apply just the cyber security is
a place to place to general what we have

250
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,889
is the ability to potentially to codify
some of this in a way that leaves little

251
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,740
room for interpretation and I think
we're not we're not there yet and in a

252
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,920
problem one problem that we have is
probably to lock a proper interaction

253
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,920
between between the parties involved

254
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,880
implication of know your customer I mean
it also sounds very plausible with

255
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,160
surface again with implication of know
your customer is if you're giving it

256
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,020
raining buckets you would have to know a
little background about everybody that

257
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,340
in 10

258
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,840
that's impossible but all of a sudden
there's a lot of bureaucratic

259
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,970
involvement with just something very
simple like training somebody to as much

260
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,870
as possible something like this so and I
run I used to run a small company but

261
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,750
was something reverse engineering
software and we had a lot of business in

262
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,870
the US and at some point somebody from
the S told us that we can tell you who

263
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,139
to sell 2012 not so too but you're
selling decisions affect all buying

264
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,550
decisions so we tried to help something
like know your customer which then the

265
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,600
two things where a particular government
that we thought we didn't want to sell

266
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,540
to order the launch software license
somewhere like we can't sell to you a

267
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,470
week later long been in an expert in
Canada sends the same order in and then

268
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,220
we like oh no we can't do that either

269
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,120
than three months later like a an
architecture student in Australia was

270
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,439
born in the country that wouldn't want
to sell to sense the same order again

271
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,550
and this just escalated over time which
means that know your customer has limits

272
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:10,090
in the sense that you can turn your
company into a private detective agency

273
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:19,139
that tries to track down everything just
followed by two things one is that while

274
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,470
database software image recognition
could be used for various things in the

275
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,640
majority all export control laws that
I've seen taking the EU level there is a

276
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,140
clause which I'm not your ads any
particular clarity to it but that the

277
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,770
system must be specially designed or
adapted for whatever axes

278
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:47,380
secondly the training issue is very very
important in terms of educating somebody

279
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,860
and I'm not even sure know your customer
the end customer is necessarily

280
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,919
determined in terms of what that will be
used for so for example a piece of

281
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,600
software that one might actually I mean
this all started with a team like honest

282
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,810
is it even a government was trying to
get its hands on this for defensive

283
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,690
purposes so that I could see the modern
othello back so they could see various

284
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:22,990
put in place various farwell measures
have been infected that adds an

285
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,390
additional I think blare of problem on
top of the actual knowing who the final

286
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:34,900
go somewhere in the responsibility on
companies you know I'd like to broaden

287
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,380
the scope here so shocking asked a
retired a rhetorical but very

288
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,850
interesting question in the message she
sent us which is how much to security

289
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,949
researchers know about politics lol
meeting and I think it's a very

290
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:58,300
important and it's a very important
question to ask ourselves and also to

291
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,159
get somebody else take on its side like
to start with Paul Wilson down pull on

292
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,650
on this one so I can safely say that I
learned more about war-making in the

293
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:13,780
last six months that I wanted to learn
but it is it is a problem right because

294
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,410
Hamas keynote was very very eloquent
telling us how deep of a hole being

295
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,940
technically so everybody's really busy
trying to get the technical worked on

296
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,560
which means nobody engages with what is
happening on the lawmaking site which

297
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,730
means it's the defense contractor
lobbyists and a few obvious from the

298
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,370
companies that get to influence
lawmaking and they have different

299
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,889
priorities from from the security
community and also securities very

300
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,100
fragments its meaning we have a lot of
relatively small companies and compared

301
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,219
to many other industries which doesn't
help when you try to make your voice

302
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,770
heard so all in all I think it's a
problem and we need to somehow fix it

303
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:00,230
but I am NOT the only one that would say
I can't be the one that fixes it it's

304
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,580
it's it's but the Tragedy of the Commons
nobody has time to engage with it and

305
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,580
then everybody gets hurt by nobody
engaging with it

306
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:14,529
whole what's your take on this being on
the other so that I think it's certainly

307
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,440
a challenge and it's not a good sign
that a reason to close interaction

308
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,880
between the security research community
and the policy makers perhaps a little

309
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,799
bit my own field I having a team which
is doing policy-making in the field of

310
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,970
cyber security and it's mostly oriented
towards resilience to economic and

311
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,730
societal you should come to a deal that
has more on economic engine for less

312
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,379
actually issues around export controls
and organizational so much important

313
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:48,850
that then we've got a group that is
doing support for technology development

314
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:57,090
that they also do a lot of scanning and
they tried to stay involved in what are

315
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,279
the current developments and the
interaction between these two groups

316
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,090
alone was already and this was in sight

317
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,799
commission was already not good so rude
reorganized in 2012 said we produce two

318
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,220
groups together so that is very
interesting but it was really the

319
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,820
challenge I think like you point a
little bit you have to have people that

320
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,110
understand technology that we've already
learned about what it means and legal or

321
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,658
policy terms and the other way around

322
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,179
and let's be honest not everybody will
be able to do that we also need to

323
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:33,720
organize for discussion and dialogue and
while we are trying to do that at least

324
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,850
in part of the Commission and redo it
also actively with our colleagues that

325
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:43,449
are responsible for example for the G
trade more into the heart or actual

326
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,960
service I think we should really get a
better organized also between two

327
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,490
communities and I think it can really
deliver a lot i mean although we are

328
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,440
often perhaps on relatively long time
skills like with regulation I mean the

329
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,509
example that you take all so they take
quite a while before us to discuss them

330
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,180
cause of parliament and although

331
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,080
when we support financial investment in
research and innovation are also a time

332
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,370
skills are relatively long because its
bureaucratic procedures you know it's

333
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:20,169
public money has been spent so as to be
all properly accountable so for sure we

334
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:26,580
are good in red tape around that takes
law did actuality or do what is actually

335
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,510
happening into cyber security field is
very very kind of punctual know I have

336
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:36,040
to answer every other few days something
for the politicians about what is

337
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,070
happening in the field so we need to
also have that knowledge on our

338
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,540
fingertips and be able to talk to people
that have it right away available and

339
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,560
that you cannot you have to organize
with it yet so what one interesting

340
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,740
thing about this is that so

341
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,750
another field I'm sort of interested in
is between related things and one I was

342
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,650
talking to a lawyer turned to look at
for Bitcoin and discussion we were

343
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:10,460
having is is it more likely that we that
we can have lawyers understand tack or

344
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,720
is it more likely that we can have take
people down to send low and we couldn't

345
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:24,410
really but I think like I guess the
interesting problem here is do we need

346
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,390
those figures or do we think it's just a
matter of having sort of like

347
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,350
translators and interpreters can isolate
technical concept to policy people and

348
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,709
vice versa

349
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:41,290
I just pick up on a couple of things
there that we're seeing an increasing

350
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:49,620
trend to the politicization of I T
security and grown up and we're now

351
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,030
seeing for global governance engaging in
hacking and whether the kicking the UK

352
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,560
just passed a bill that UK government I
pretty much anything anywhere anytime

353
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:06,070
and this pushing I T security or cyber
security into the into the political

354
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:15,520
domain while maybe ok in one respect I'm
not sure that the overall benefits to

355
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,889
the actual security and privacy of
systems

356
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,740
and again i'm happy to be wrong on this
but the other point as well as that I

357
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:31,780
think security work is any sharia is
hard enough without having to also be

358
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,790
familiar with a significant amount of
legislation and not just the legislation

359
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:42,450
as written because for anyone who's been
following the debate arrangement has

360
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,560
been clarified whatever that means in
the UK and the us- and while we were

361
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,830
told that this would include 0 days in
the USA include 0 days in terms of

362
00:32:52,830 --> 00:33:00,189
disclosing them so if I i think at the
very outset the legal framework needs to

363
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:07,230
be it is to be regulation is to be
introduced in this area it must be clear

364
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,780
than any previous piece of legislation
I've ever read in terms of having

365
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,340
somebody who doesn't

366
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,290
for example even understand the notion
is a separation of powers rule of law

367
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,340
and the constitution would regulate
things various different rights freedom

368
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,139
of expression things like that so that
they don't have to go digging for cases

369
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:31,430
on how an individual lawyers transposed
and then interpreted because i think

370
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:36,750
thats it is a different skill set right
how you deal with the computer system is

371
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,600
very very different to have you need to
familiarize yourself with the

372
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,010
implications of a law and how it
ultimately gets gets interpreted by

373
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,160
judges and then very stiff increases and
how they interrelate together

374
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:55,750
touching on an important points which is
particularly relevant in Europe due to

375
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,720
the fact that every nation implements
their own version of the guideline

376
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,520
the European markets is much more
fragmented legally what happens a lot of

377
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,739
times when we're done with reverse
engineered we try to get legal advice on

378
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:13,819
whether particular reverse engineering
act for security legal and usually the

379
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,010
lawyers told as well

380
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,290
the law for this has never been tested
in your jurisdiction so we can tell you

381
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:25,139
this makes the situation worse in Europe
because any law that is implemented most

382
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,469
likely you happen to be in a country in
Europe with hasn't been tested yet so

383
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:28,819
the

384
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,380
the interpretation of that law is even
not clear 22 domain experts say exactly

385
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,300
if it's not clear to people who are
experts in export control laws they've

386
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,450
lived in Britain for many many years how
can we expect people who don't have a

387
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:49,409
legal background and don't have these
kind of this train died for these

388
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,429
racing's to understand and this brings
in the notion of chilling effect well I

389
00:34:54,429 --> 00:35:01,569
just won't do it and I guess that's one
of the major concerns around a lot just

390
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,950
briefly reacting what one is that you
absolutely have to be close to this

391
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,770
process because they going to happen
anyway you know what we want to do not

392
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,620
whether it leads to something less so
that was a separate question you know

393
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,040
policymakers will anyway

394
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,220
politicians will anyway have a view on
it but I was actually making sense in

395
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,640
terms of lore technology at all so
politics plays an important role in this

396
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,770
but then I think it's absolutely
essential that once people are starting

397
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:35,670
to design lets say guidelines are
legislation around it that is that

398
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:41,470
really really well informed test against
what does it mean in technological terms

399
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,720
and vice versa because I agree with you
it's easy to write down so I mean it's

400
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,220
easy to ride on let's do security by
design privacy by design so what

401
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,299
actually and and shootouts at the
political level let alone date you ridin

402
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,190
law ok make it happen and what i doin
intended consequence of that so

403
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,140
unfortunately perhaps we have to be very
close to it from a technological point

404
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,350
of view and it is interesting that I've
never read a lot of never heard

405
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,730
lawmakers in any choice of law and order
and then in the UK

406
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:18,730
ever mention this term unintended
consequences I'm struggling to

407
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:23,840
understand who you see these
consequences unintended

408
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,810
you know you need to be able to the
moment we foreseeable it must have the

409
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:34,700
necessary precision and if a consequence
actually occurs because for example

410
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:44,109
is it is an unintended there doesn't
seem to be the level of debate to tease

411
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,530
out what these unintended consequences
are so that lawmakers policymakers can

412
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,600
be fully informed so that in reality the
amount of unintended consequences very

413
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:01,589
very small and I think a lot of people
online have demonstrated consequences

414
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,510
that while they may not be alone may not
be intended by the individuals in terms

415
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,920
of what they're doing their
interpretation of the law which is

416
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,460
equally valid because they're going to
be doing it intentionally not doing the

417
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,840
security research that notion of
unintended consequences doesn't seem to

418
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,010
be unable to kind of get my head around
that as a as a concept going forward

419
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,220
can interject on this so I think one of
the core we're discussing really is

420
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:37,189
about again communication and sort of
like making sure that everyone is as

421
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:44,640
much a picture as possible now the paint
so in the us- and us like an interesting

422
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,400
interesting debate whether it's actually
working or not but one of the concept is

423
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:57,220
to try and nap small programs are funded
by agencies like darpa that both fun

424
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,089
universities and also small companies
and individuals with it yet at besides

425
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,780
reducing sort of like a rock received
within the government concerns fourth

426
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,550
one of the potential positive side
effects is to be able to have like a

427
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:18,070
funnel of talents from the technical
side of things that can be used whenever

428
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:23,880
something on a policy level needs to be
discussed so I guess me questions here

429
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:32,590
are one do you think that having some
kind of structure like that you would

430
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:38,520
make sense and if so we think that it's
possible what sort of exactly

431
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:47,099
their past like cyber fast track title
problems so my my personal take on this

432
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:54,710
is that how it works in the sense that
it does like you do so

433
00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:01,109
a connection with certain parts of the
government's that then they can say

434
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:12,990
we're discussing and I can tell there
was no such link and you would like to

435
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:23,348
get some jumping in sorry but my worry
would be obscene more than one company

436
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:30,300
in Europe whose main products of writing
grant applications for more European

437
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,540
Union Money

438
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:37,589
lunches which is so sorry but that's one
of the problems right so application for

439
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:42,940
something like this cyber strike takes
you about today right location for like

440
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:48,810
a grant both in the USA and Europe takes
you months so that I guess what I'm

441
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:54,890
saying is that it may not be necessarily
the right avenue to use the funding of

442
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,049
research the policy aldrich

443
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:02,069
those may need to be separate things but
I don't know and I don't agree with that

444
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:07,670
but I also think in addition to so
fasten are in general is implemented in

445
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:13,690
DUI regulation becomes effective across
all the countries and then they can have

446
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,440
some implementing clarifications of
measures in their own national law and

447
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,170
to the best of my knowledge there was no
or little of that kind of outreach in

448
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,050
relation to the arrangement an intrusion
software on indie culture is on

449
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:39,410
monitoring tools so I think maybe you
would be in a better place both you and

450
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:45,569
i couldnt tus would have some sort of
process by which concerns could be

451
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:52,570
raised could be raised publicly so that
I don't know how how how you could

452
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,080
figure out which concerns get taken
seriously in which don't was probably

453
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:03,319
the politicians but I can make to
concrete proposals on us we are working

454
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,730
on what is called a contractual
private-public partnership in the field

455
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:12,480
of cyber security the intention is
actually to be stronger as Europe in an

456
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,230
hour and just talk about this is really
about that so it's not covering the

457
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,170
world and everything and all the topics
that you can do there it's it's about

458
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,060
that but related to what you can do

459
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,050
companies and also a system security
researchers perhaps for more and US Open

460
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:33,110
if you are all kind of other issues that
have to do with the development cycles

461
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,360
innovation systems whose working
together with whom standard

462
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,460
certification we are going to launch at
the end of this month

463
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,830
public consultation that so that's an
immediate possibility to quite feedback

464
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:52,870
and input to that bureaucratic process
but that goes relatively fast so and

465
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:57,830
it's the second is we will have quite a
lot of discussions around forming this

466
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,900
partnership I dot my invitation would be
that also to cybersecurity

467
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,370
security research community is part of
that and so coming back to your

468
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,089
suggestion can you have something done
before

469
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,290
fast-track shoulder as I understand it
and that's all we need to look at it

470
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,060
also how did it function and why would
it be possible to redefine

471
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,970
the research agenda in Europe and some
of the tools probably yes so is it going

472
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:31,359
to be very rapid scheme like the one day
I'm convinced that's a bit but spot

473
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,980
someone else sees an opportunity in
depth discussion as well I can I'm

474
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,070
interested in supporting that so it
doesn't need to be old your funding that

475
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,490
moves into that perhaps the Finnish
government is interested in it and takes

476
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:48,470
it up to do that much more rapidly so
important is I think that we have a

477
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:54,810
fairly concrete policy development going
on it's not legislate if it's about this

478
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,080
strong of research and innovation and it
should deliver or ultimately by the

479
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,680
middle of next year now and our thing I
want to touch home my question spitball

480
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,690
potential solutions to the problem so
one of the things that shocked aside in

481
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:17,080
video was that the permissions to
community needs to get its act together

482
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:26,360
so the question here is what was a 111
optioned areas let's try to have fun all

483
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,010
summer to like cyber cyber
infrastructure same or better question

484
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:37,010
is do we need potentially a trade
association for small and medium

485
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:42,440
enterprises and potential Europe or
worldwide that deals specifically with

486
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,140
cybersecurity and if we think we need
that I'll do we make sure that doesn't

487
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:57,560
turn shoe Issa or similar to mine
question would be why is the focus on

488
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,259
enterprise mobile enterprise I mean like
small businesses and also plays an

489
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,780
individual certainly that the way it the
way I see it is that the current

490
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:13,550
landscape is you have vendors and their
lobbyists and they have their own set of

491
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:18,220
interests then you have certain trade
associations like Issa think there are a

492
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:24,020
couple of others which supposedly
represent the entire industry but what I

493
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:29,210
what I can gather is that they represent
a part of the industry to does not

494
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:36,340
you'd sort of like the researchers and
people that another way of exposing this

495
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,330
is their pretend to part of the industry
today actually supply complements

496
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,040
today's security policies and so on so
forth but they don't represent the part

497
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,460
of the industry that actually creates
new products that does research and so

498
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:54,080
on sports in my personal take animals
discussing this with full before is that

499
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,950
if when it comes

500
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,620
especially when it comes to policy and
regulation you want to talk to the

501
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:05,130
researchers and again to people to do in
the future because they have a

502
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:12,170
longer-term view on things versus the
guide of bright spot in so and so that's

503
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:17,260
what I mean by trade association I mean
like in neutral in that sort of research

504
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,510
is done by small groups whether they are
separate companies group group groups of

505
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:28,740
friends or small departments within
organizations do we need sort of like a

506
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,629
trade association for those type of
people and you see if so how can we

507
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:41,710
prevent that from going bad and turn you
to say so I think it would be terribly

508
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,650
useful to have some sort of organization
that helps us have a voice in policy

509
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,230
discussions was gonna be hard to put it
off in the sense that we're very

510
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:55,040
heterogeneous group right with
insecurity there is security vendors the

511
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,810
people that implement security and
corporations which are all feeling like

512
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,009
we we have a friendly but adversarial
relationship with security product

513
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:07,090
Bendis than their security researchers
which may or may not have any corporate

514
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:13,040
banking at all so any trade associations
you mentioned it is going to be a

515
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,490
difficult thing to pull all these
different interests in there and also a

516
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,100
lot of people that are capable of
bringing money to the table may not

517
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:28,850
actually be healthy for the organisation
right because even within the security

518
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,930
community there's a lot of disagreement
about what percentage of security

519
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:36,200
products I show you how one set
something in his speech something

520
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,470
something was turning into the next AVG
Antivirus right so he's using antivirus

521
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,779
as an example something horrible point
being getting these things on the one

522
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,990
hand and making sure that the money
doesn't distort things is going to be

523
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,549
tricky but at least the policymakers
would have somebody to talk to

524
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,860
which at the moment I think of a policy
makers also hey can you like US policy

525
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,280
proposal call your favorite cyber
experts to to comment on its most of

526
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,410
them wouldn't know whom to call ya I
think that you're right I think it will

527
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,790
be very difficult to get one for us so
why don't you forget about getting to

528
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:16,120
one horse so just give a set of opinions
that's already a tremendous value I

529
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,740
understand that many of these trade
associations to try to get to the

530
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,100
consensus approach because they want to
be really powerful under you can office

531
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,670
but okay that's perhaps for another
stage of our dedicated to topics but

532
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:33,580
there is at the moment not even a
possibility to get the diversity of

533
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,340
views which already would be very good
and then you'll see that as an immediate

534
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,590
dialogue with policymakers are quite
positive if you avoid the bureaucracy

535
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:45,610
around trade associations because they
all many of them become also

536
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,920
bureaucratic organizations cell and I
think this community can be very good at

537
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,760
doing that because that's the way I
think also year many of these events are

538
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,810
happening so does well saying you're
saying is you will be an overdue amount

539
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:04,250
so there will be a tremendous amount for
this reason I say that is that refocus

540
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:11,900
your props on general legislation which
is for all kind of I T technologies and

541
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:17,590
all kind of sectors in principle but I
happened to see my portfolio also do

542
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:23,500
things around for example automated
driving energy system creates or digital

543
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,940
health and all these people are in
tremendous need to get advice really you

544
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,900
know automated driving his surroundings
forward very quickly and we i think are

545
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,400
really interested need to know that
these out of a motive companies who need

546
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,180
to know where they're going to be in the
field all security I T security else is

547
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,410
almost unexplored and it's one of our
risk environment so there I think that

548
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:56,910
will be needed a lot of interest to
interact so before we open to questions

549
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:03,950
I want to close with one question or
region poll which is so personally I

550
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,450
think this applies to trauma center
everyone else from the industry that is

551
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,580
being involved in this process we
learned a lot in terms of what it means

552
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:16,340
to deal with policymakers work means to
deal with private organizations human

553
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:24,090
rights organizations and transports the
passion for the two of you is what else

554
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:27,090
can we learn like walked every messed up
cuz

555
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,850
international example is a good one cuz
if I recall correctly and that doesn't

556
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:40,170
apply to international flights a bunch
of different organizations for instance

557
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:46,940
your stance on tourism sector change
anything during like the past few months

558
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:53,710
I think part of it was our problem since
that we could not find a proper way to

559
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:59,860
communicate what we were trying to say
about inclusion so maybe maybe was not

560
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,810
entirely your fault but I guess my
question is do you guys have a slightly

561
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:09,960
different background what do you think
we should do better in terms of dealing

562
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,570
with your organization your capital
gains you think that's a that's a very

563
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:22,040
fair characterization our starting point
was to limit the country or to limit the

564
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,870
spread of things like in Fisher I can
team to repressive regimes that was a

565
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:33,210
starting point to abdicate for what
essentially is a very attractive and

566
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:39,110
very effective mechanism in Boston are
you actually get almost forty states for

567
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,590
free you can convince a number of them
to propose something and vote on it

568
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,400
before she led the the text I was
proposed as many people pointed out from

569
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,980
day one that it was going to catch many
things that would essentially undermine

570
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,940
the privacy and security of the very
activist stuff we were we were trying to

571
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:07,850
protect I think it took us time to
assimilate the information that was

572
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:12,020
coming out of us but I don't think
that's necessarily the fault of the

573
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:18,330
security community this is there was
there was many many people emailed me

574
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:24,540
out of the blue to offer their take
their opinions and I engage with every

575
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:32,840
single one of them and it took time to
to understand what exactly what's been

576
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:39,360
said and from our understanding of both
export control and the technology itself

577
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:48,250
so I think now that we're in this better
position where we appreciate the nuances

578
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:55,060
of I T security and the the nuances of
export controls and how potentially

579
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:01,470
damaging to be I think I prefer to
characterize it as more full day on our

580
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:07,230
side than anyone else aside because it
was a really kind of hardening and

581
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:12,280
almost medicare's invite my next Sunday
when I saw so many people online with

582
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,900
very very

583
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,970
meticulously thought-out arguments that
unfortunate just took us time to two

584
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:27,649
parts and go through so I think drives
to suggestions well as that of course we

585
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:35,829
Bulldog security privacy to existing
technologies as an office also now with

586
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:40,109
5g Internet of Things coming at least
you should do that a little bit better

587
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:44,509
and I think that's these are things that
are important developments right and

588
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:51,950
you're curious cause you're saying that
a lot of the EU legislation gets into

589
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,279
place in at the national level so you
may have 28 different violations of that

590
00:52:56,279 --> 00:53:02,950
is around to data retention and you were
referring to the case goes to the UK so

591
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,980
it's quite important now because else
today to retention directive has

592
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,839
actually been rejected by the Court of
Justice in Seoul National loss are

593
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:16,078
coming up now to follow that as a
process very closely so that we are

594
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,470
certainly also avoiding that we got the
kind of the wrong balance here between

595
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,990
for example security and economic
interests to mention one of the

596
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:28,890
consequence that and come out that so
that's that we get a whole patchwork

597
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:34,279
offer solutions as i think is an
important current development so any

598
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:37,279
questions from the audience

599
00:53:49,450 --> 00:54:04,078
in other words the products fill the gap
to very very good but that's why a lot

600
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:10,220
of potential because it included a lot
of the state's China wasn't included in

601
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,250
that a lot of the states who would
eventually be seen to be economic

602
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:20,109
competitors and that any timing of the
hands through through a regulator regime

603
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:24,130
us a UK company and then you had a
French company which could fill that gap

604
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:30,930
by going through our mechanism it would
kind of neutralize none not completely

605
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:36,160
neutralized what remedy that argument
you're living as well we see is that a

606
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,660
lot of countries when they're buying
their surveillance operator US I'm not

607
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,460
sure it's necessarily purity along
technical lines it often falls along

608
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:52,359
political lines so if country was was
looking to China to fill the gap of

609
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:58,480
European companies that were coming
along as we follow the surroundings

610
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:06,180
injury but I'm not sure countries would
necessarily trusts that kinda technology

611
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,470
is embedded into US national security
operatives I could be wrong but there

612
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,680
does seem to be a little bit of
reluctance even in the UK for example

613
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:20,190
one of the big telcos was looking to buy
Reuters for its backbone and there was

614
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,210
big outcry from the members of
parliament which no should be using

615
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:31,770
Chinese technology in this hallway was
the company so i think im not quite as

616
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:35,170
simple as if we can't get it from this
place will go somewhere else we did see

617
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:42,780
him he captures been rejected for sale
to Pakistan from Switzerland but as you

618
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:47,010
say I'm fairly certain they could find
them somewhere else and maybe as a as a

619
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:52,589
stick to prevent that kind of
circumventing of the regulations made me

620
00:55:52,589 --> 00:56:00,349
it will prevent the company from selling
and marketing director just want to

621
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:05,759
Russian I think that the right question
there is there are certain things that

622
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:11,839
would require the cooperation of all the
missions or i dont thats or the other

623
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:18,690
option is to say that we take dir moral
ground we being Europe poor thing we

624
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:26,479
accept the cost of not doing certain
type of businesses if former approach so

625
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:32,339
everyone agrees worked then the UN would
be an effective organization but we know

626
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:40,089
it's not answer the question is do we
believe that the wounds to take the IR

627
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:44,890
moral ground to tackle tact and human
rights

628
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:48,589
at least that's a question I would ask
myself

629
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:31,620
question in terms of the both not only
the actual example red tape but also in

630
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,180
the chilling effect on people not
engaging in the work in the first place

631
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,339
and that's why I think much of the
language inside of us on our or any of

632
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,700
the proposed language in the EU and
national law needs to make it extremely

633
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:50,290
clear what is and is not regulated to
the point that an ordinary individual

634
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:55,130
can read the piece of legislation and no
it cannot amend legislation like a power

635
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,990
of which as you're doing this and it's
not even an exception so one of the

636
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:03,589
things that are tends to do a lot of
actual control it and to do is this

637
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:07,940
generic statement of the following is
control in a prima facie statement and

638
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,010
then later on you have to go in and find
out if if the work you're doing is

639
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,210
subject to an exemption and so for
things like vulnerabilities and things

640
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:23,220
like that would like to see the language
so that there is no there is no prospect

641
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,850
of many of the the security tools

642
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:33,110
bilities even coming within the language
at all we have time for a question that

643
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,270
should last no longer than 30 seconds
and 11

644
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:42,700
that thanks a lot of our panelists

645
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,020
a round of applause
