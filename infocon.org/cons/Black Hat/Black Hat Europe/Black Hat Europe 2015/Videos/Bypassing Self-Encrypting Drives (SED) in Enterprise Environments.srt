1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,159
now will thank you everybody for coming
what a privilege to be the first talk

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:11,309
after the keynote just a show of hands
who here knows what said are excellent

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,518
for those of you that don't don't worry
about it we're going to go into what

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,430
those are

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,000
and the best part is we have demos and
we have duct tape involving into the

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,230
most so you know that there was going to
be good so before we get into the

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,750
details and the interesting part for
what everybody's here for just a very

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,600
brief introduction and Daniel both
counsel for those who don't know me I

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,290
work in the forensic technology
e-discovery group with KPMG Canada and

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,870
my background actually has been starting
in ninety securities so deploying System

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,899
securely operating system security
that's where I start it and once I gotta

12
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,020
feel that I mastered that to a certain
level I said ok it's all fun trying to

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,600
deploy and operate system securely now
that I know how to do that reasonably

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,910
well let me try to see if I can break
into stuff so if I know how people

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,740
deploy and operate things and I know the
shortcuts did they will take because

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,149
everybody has a short cuts in everybody
has to have a capital idea for the

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,869
spending the money that is spent

18
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,420
I know what the holes are things that
are left open so why would I moved to

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,700
penetration testing and red teaming and
breaking into stuff and then after I did

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,869
that for a couple of years and I said
yeah I know I know how to break into

21
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,810
stuff and I know how hackers breaking
stuff and I hope industries breaking

22
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,610
through stuff and you heard the keynote
earlier this morning saying that there's

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,909
two different ways in which hackers
hacking

24
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:42,610
sisters hawk but I said yeah I pretty
much know how we go about it it's feels

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,579
interesting now we'd probably a time to
move over once again so then I moved to

26
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,839
the forensic investigations with the
knowledge of how hikers go around I'm

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,990
now looking at winter's been hacking
incident when people do bad things using

28
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,060
computers looking into that and finding
that out then catching those bad people

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,680
and I have a couple of professional
certifications to cover these three

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,310
areas and then doing my advancement
through this these various stages I was

31
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,280
always passionate about security
research

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,740
which is one of the reasons why I'm
presenting here in presenting the result

33
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,430
of some security research worth
mentioning I'm an organizer for the

34
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,910
North security conference and hacking
marathon in Montreal if you've never

35
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,700
been to Montreal its Europe and North
America so highly encouraged to go there

36
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,829
attend the conference is awesome hacking
competition only gotten one mic so bear

37
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:47,140
with us please thank you Mike to
prisoners should be an interesting day

38
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,160
so I'm a partner at KPMG in their cyber
practice at least two teams the first

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,310
one cybersecurity helping organizations
identify the critical assets and sure

40
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,310
they got the right safeguards in place
to actually protect those assets the

41
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,630
other team as a cyber forensic teams in
the event of a suspected intrusion we

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,780
will go and investigate confirm or deny
if something happened if something did

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,410
happen we determine what the what the
scope of the compromise is and help

44
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,780
organizations recover from that
compromise I'm author of single-serve

45
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,769
forensic analysis data breach
preparation and response as well as

46
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,560
contributing author meeting up written
chapters for about six other security

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,269
and forensic books I speak a lot of
conferences I did the Black Eyed biggest

48
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,760
conference in 07 before us with a
professional services company now with

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,959
KPMG so I thought I'd be smart to put a
suit on and again as I mentioned before

50
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't see too many other suits out
there but either way it's the same

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,739
person just just in the suit also
developer of quite a few database

52
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,130
forensic tools regarding interrogating
caches and actually collecting artifacts

53
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,049
and analyzing artifacts from within the
database management systems and these

54
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,160
tools used from law enforcement agencies
across North America and actually went

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,530
to the one of the leading banks here in
Europe and also a sans lethal forensic

56
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,370
area which is a long convoluted term
meaning I hold a coin that there's a

57
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,160
bunch of rules that if someone
challenges me I have to I have to follow

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,420
protocol her ass after by rounds

59
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,130
at a barber for individuals have been
challenged yet but if anyone has a coin

60
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,430
that I might be might be very games are
easy pickings so what are we gonna talk

61
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,230
about today we're gonna start off with
on whether stds based on the discussion

62
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,090
of the question Daniel throughout their
earlier it seems like a lot of people in

63
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,859
this room today are all already familiar
with what self-encrypting drives are but

64
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,250
we're going to take a back to basics for
some of you may not be as as intimate

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,419
with them we're gonna look at typical
sed enterprise deployment so how

66
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,599
organizations actually using a CDS
within their enterprise environments

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,690
where they gonna get to the to the meat
and potatoes which is the actual tax

68
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,570
mario's we're gonna look at what how
attacks actually occur and we actually

69
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,979
have some live demos and its Daniel
mentioned docked able to the demos well

70
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:11,550
for any queries you may have in the
audience so be forewarned we're also

71
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,919
gonna look at some of the mitigation
strategies so once you see the

72
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,630
vulnerability with think it's important
that you understand the ways you can

73
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,610
actually protect your organization your
personal assets against some of the

74
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,560
attacks will be will be stepping through
then we'll be looking at detection of

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
past exploitation so it's great to know
about ability exists equally as

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,669
important to go back and try and figure
out if you pop your own before the rain

77
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:42,150
cover some of that then look at some
real-world implications looking at the

78
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,539
session we do have about five or 10
minutes carved out at the end for

79
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,800
questions and answers any questions
please make sure to get that into the

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,640
session just a start things off and we
talked about the state of data

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,210
encryption out there so we have had a
question by someone saying is this

82
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,370
regarding another vulnerability that
just came out last week and this talk is

83
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,030
actually separate than that but I think
it's a great segue into a new look at

84
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,909
data encryption as a gee there's been a
number of vulnerabilities for both

85
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,930
encryption products in flight as well as
encryption products protecting data at

86
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:24,700
rest a few examples are a logjam free
pool harpley 44 data flight data at rest

87
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,539
will come down to TrueCrypt

88
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,830
would be one example as well so a lot of
these open source tools and some

89
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,469
commercial tools not to mention here
that commercial vendors definitely have

90
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,920
a lot of all abilities associate with
their products so technology people have

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,070
been using including software people
have been using to protect information

92
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,240
definitely on people are starting to
poke holes in them and a lot of

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,320
researchers are deathly spending a lot
of time focusing on organizations also

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,300
are having an increasing concerns
regarding the access that some

95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,220
governments have reportedly gained
within some of these encryption products

96
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,560
so those talks in their stories they're
not going to debate whether the fact or

97
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,220
fiction but there's a lot of talks
regarding some government agencies who

98
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,250
have funded security programs to
actually introduced laws are introduced

99
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,010
bugs into a lot of these encryption
products to grant them access to

100
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,960
information that supposed to be
protected so it's a lot of organizations

101
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
concerned about that as well

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,100
something else will see in the end the
data breach of the Data Encryption

103
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,890
landscape comes down to a lot of
breaches have involved encrypted

104
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,909
information but the organization's
number one are still disclosing that the

105
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,170
breach has occurred in for instance at
the bridge happens including encrypted

106
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,820
passwords people still recommending that
you actually reset their passwords the

107
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,060
reason for that is they just don't trust
the way the developers have implemented

108
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,490
data encryption within a lot of the
products so a lot of organizations are

109
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,860
taking a step back and saying well this
sed thing is pretty interesting it's

110
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,430
good encryption and there's little to no
overhead caused all of the encryption

111
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,880
all the processing etc is done to
hardware level so a lot of people ICC in

112
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,950
the in the advertisement down here a lot
of people are referring to as CDs as the

113
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,250
best thing since sliced bread from a
data protection standpoint when we

114
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,240
finish the taco let you draw your own
conclusions but to some pretty

115
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,590
interesting research we're gonna step
through at this point I think we're

116
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,679
headed to Daniel to get into some of the
some of the meat potatoes sure thing

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:32,020
right so before we get into that
interesting part of what are the

118
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,929
problems we're seeing with this season
specifically in an enterprise

119
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:35,709
environment

120
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,469
let's take a step back and see where
we're coming from so before there were a

121
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,700
CDs or sets the way I'm going to call
them from the presentation cause it's

122
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,860
just easier there was the standard
software-based encryption so the

123
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,570
classical full disk encryption where
it's actually something that's working

124
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,390
on the computer on the processor that
encrypts and decrypts there on the fly

125
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,500
and that library or later usually sit
somewhere in the operating system this

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,580
type of encryption has a couple of
advantages it works regardless of the

127
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,540
hardware that you have meaning that
doesn't matter what model of hard drive

128
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,420
you have what model of laptop you have
it's gonna work on all standard hardware

129
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,260
the application doesn't see that its
encryption is in place the operating

130
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,520
system automatically handles that in
heights that for anything that

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,610
application layer there's a couple
disadvantages with the classical full

132
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,850
disk encryption that is the
software-based one of them is the slow

133
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,930
in place encryption so let's say you
have a laptop with one terabyte of data

134
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,370
I need to say that yes now I want in
crippled their you actually have to go

135
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,790
through reading all of that data
encrypting it and writing it included on

136
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,510
the hard drive so that takes a lot of
time reading that they are and also

137
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,670
because this is done in the secure their
to encrypt and decrypt the data one

138
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,469
every week read and write there is a
slight performance overhead now with

139
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,010
more modern processors that's less of a
problem and also we have dedicated

140
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,520
hardware in the processors that can help
that in some of the encryption products

141
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,439
actually take advantage of that so if we
look at this diagram just to illustrate

142
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,380
how software-based encryption would work
what we have here at the left this is

143
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,800
the drive and this can be hard drive
awareness is d where can be a thumb

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,109
drive for this particular example let's
assume this is the hard drive that's

145
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,750
used to boot the machine so well you'll
spend on that driver typically two areas

146
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,430
that will be an area which is the
pre-bid software which is unencrypted

147
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,910
that

148
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,709
and there will be an area which is the
user data this is the part that's

149
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,940
encrypted so when the machine is powered
on its the preview Trafford that's being

150
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,350
loaded whether that's true crypt
BitLocker or any other full disk

151
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,450
encryption software that was being
loaded and then on the computer you will

152
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,870
have this opera description a year there
will be able to read the rest of the day

153
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,970
and make sure the operating system loads
and boots properly and then once the

154
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,590
operating system is loaded the encrypted
data which is the actual operating

155
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,060
system files and the user files and
everything you would store on the drive

156
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,640
will be transmitted over the seitan
interface encrypted and then the

157
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,900
computer the CPU or will decrypt that
they're out once it gets there and

158
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,949
presented to the application into the
operating system in an unencrypted which

159
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,390
now this was software-based encryption
now we're moving to hardware-based

160
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,370
encryption and when that encryption is
done on the hard drive that's what we

161
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,580
call a self-encrypting drive or a said
so it's an actual component on the

162
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,930
controller of the drive that's handling
the crippled it's not happening in the

163
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,780
processor anymore not taking CPU cycles
it's done on the dry now a couple of

164
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,069
advantages year because the CPU and you
always doesn't have anything to do with

165
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,560
it obviously doesn't have the
performance overhead of software-based

166
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,680
encryption so that's a great thing there
is instant in place encryption issue

167
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,870
have a hard drive that said compatible
and you might have one and not realize

168
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,020
that in your laptop and you want to
activate encryption it's a matter of

169
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,300
turning the switch and put your hard
drive will be encrypted right away and

170
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,329
we're gonna get into the details of how
that exactly works and how that's

171
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,950
possible but that's a big advantage
you'll have to wait for a couple of

172
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,820
hours or less depending on the speed of
your drive but surely increase the bid

173
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,340
on the drive so just as for the
software-based encryption for the

174
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,830
applications this is transparent but
also for the operating system this is

175
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,400
transparent once the unlocking part has
been done and will see that in second

176
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,120
the operating system doesn't even know
where doesn't even care that the drive

177
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,800
is encrypted now there's a couple of
requirements obviously you have to have

178
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,649
a drive that said compatible

179
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,730
but also in some cases the motherboard
has to support certain features and

180
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,959
there's also a management component just
like with software-based encryption

181
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,739
there's the previous indication and the
layer that sits there and always that

182
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,339
manages how drivers encrypt their
usernames and passwords recovery keys

183
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:10,249
said also have a management component to
them and the disadvantages four sets

184
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:16,429
anybody know of any disadvantages here
in the room you're not allowed to dock

185
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:21,279
with the way these products are being
promoted the sales are like if you

186
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,089
mention the have only advantages when
compared to software-based full disk

187
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,019
encryption and no apparent disadvantages
so we should all be using that and we'll

188
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,879
see a couple of potential issues that we
might have there in the stock so we're

189
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:43,829
looking at the same diagram but now
we're having gone said to drive drive so

190
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:49,429
here at the left the set also has an
area which will call a system area and

191
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:54,339
depending on in what way the drive works
there would be different things stored

192
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,300
in the system area will get better in
the second and then there's the user

193
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,479
data section as well which is encrypted
now the difference here is like I

194
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,879
mentioned there's a crippled processor
on the drive itself that has the job of

195
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,189
encrypting and decrypting data and then
they don't travels through the SATA

196
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:18,009
interface unencrypted so on the data
cable and we have a couple of them will

197
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:22,559
probably be some demos with them the
data travels unencrypted and then the

198
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,029
operating system just sees that they
don't uses that as if it was a standard

199
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,529
drive it as if the driver is not
encrypted and they're still management

200
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:35,929
commands are sent over the the the state
on channel to manage active in

201
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:43,399
encryption change encryption keys and so
on so in which ways can you manage your

202
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,179
self encrypting drives you remember I
mentioned there is the management

203
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:53,149
component around the south including
dries legacy way of doing this it's

204
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:59,160
what's called a TA or other security so
this is basically managing the

205
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,850
self-encrypting drive encryption part

206
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,540
using standard commands that we were
using before

207
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,329
to lock and unlock drives so this is the
drive before that was encryption there

208
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:15,449
was a future in in some drives in the
command subset 44 up where you could say

209
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,949
I want to lock the drive and only
allowed to drive if you have a certain

210
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:22,229
password if I send the right password so
one way to bypass that was you can just

211
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,250
remove the board the controller from the
Dr putting on your board and then you

212
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,810
will have access to the data would be
unencrypted or just connect directly

213
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,859
with the proper controller to the drive
itself by pastel controller all together

214
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,639
now for said it's the exact same
principle the same commands to lock and

215
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,690
unlock a drive just that now there does
encrypted on the drive and the data will

216
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,240
be encrypted based on the password that
we sent to unlock the drive this is

217
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,720
typically managed by the BIOS or the
UEFI or if you're using some low-level

218
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,769
talks like a cheap arm you can check the
status of a drive to seafood if you

219
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,550
choose this option and and and activate
or deactivate encryption the downside

220
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,769
about this one of the big downside is
that the encryption is not standardized

221
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,410
yes

222
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,800
substitute for commands define how the
lock and unlock or authenticate commands

223
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,258
will be sent but after that how to drive
will decide where the vendor will decide

224
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,600
to implement encryption in the in the
drive itself really depends on what the

225
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,250
vendor things might be the best option
to do that and not all of them use the

226
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,399
same thing but in general if we look at
it that they don't the drive is always

227
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,259
encrypted with what's called data
encryption key or media encryption key

228
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:43,920
so when you have a drive that in other
security mode usually from the factory

229
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,290
there will be a mega media encryption
key and data will be encrypted with this

230
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,990
key and then the make itself will be
encrypted with a check or key encryption

231
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,839
key and this key encryption key is very
very from the password so when I'm home

232
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,179
locking the drive with a password that
passwords used to generate a key and

233
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,520
that key unlocks the cuban encrypt the
data on the drive and by default it's

234
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,849
just that this cake is not for Georgia 0
so that's why when the drives

235
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,859
is not activated your data is actually
encrypted on the drive is just that the

236
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:26,349
key to decrypt the encryption key is
just euros this was the legacy Mon to

237
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,590
the security mode what we're seeing now
and the more modern way of doing things

238
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,570
is using the open standard which is a
standard from the Trusted Computing

239
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,149
Group the story security subclass system
subclass

240
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,690
hope all is a new set of commands
different than the other Security

241
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,140
Command that has been designed with the
purpose of having encryption in place so

242
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,130
whereas the other we were just pouring
all command commands this is something

243
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,570
completely new and one of the big
advantages between opal and other

244
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,590
security that opens are meant to be
managed by software so we're not gonna

245
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,928
have the BIOS when we put on the machine
ask for a hard reset password to type in

246
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:11,659
eastern we're gonna have software that's
managing the encryption on the drive and

247
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:15,710
this is the big advantage for enterprise
deployments because we can more easily

248
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,730
manage software and decide define
recovery keys decide what are the uses

249
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,710
that have access to synchronize and and
and and all that good stuff there is a

250
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,030
pretty good indication that happening
and it is not in the BIOS is some

251
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,299
software and this is being loaded when
the computer boots up through what's

252
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:40,080
called an MDR shadowing mechanism so
once again similar to the other security

253
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,439
there's always encrypted issues that
this time the key question key is

254
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,110
generated by the management software
microsoft said that this looks all

255
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,639
interesting but we'd like to add a
couple of requirements on top of the

256
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,909
Opel standard so they created what
they're calling the Microsoft encrypted

257
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:03,320
drive standard or driving short which is
opal plus a couple of requirements and

258
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,178
the management software for this one is
a bit longer so you can use BitLocker To

259
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,590
Do standard software encryption but you
can also use BitLocker out of the box

260
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,149
from a Windows machine to manage result
fingerprint rice and this was when I

261
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,010
first discovered this is it well this is
amazing I didn't know it was that easy

262
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,190
to use and you're not aware of it or if
you're not careful you might actually

263
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,380
trigger

264
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,270
BitLocker in the south including Dr Mohd
drive without even noticing and the

265
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,230
operation is very similar to open and
then another category is for all of the

266
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,640
drives that we see customer
implementations

267
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,800
what's typical it's the USB hard drives
or the thumb drives that don't following

268
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,050
your standards and there is usually
either some software on the device

269
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,190
itself that can manage encryption so a
great example of that is the Western

270
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,470
Digital drives where you plug in the
drive you're going to see a CD pop-up

271
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,450
you're gonna run the application there
and that application gonna send the

272
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,940
command that will lock or unlock the
driver encrypt or decrypt the drive but

273
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,160
in some cases there is a hardware
component there is drives for example

274
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,320
that have a PIN pad on them and you
actually have to type the password on

275
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,020
the PIN pad on the hard-working pad and
that will send up into the drive

276
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,290
controller which then will decrypt
include the drive we've seen four

277
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,159
different ways in which said can be
managed will focus on the open

278
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,430
technology right here why because this
is what we were seeing as a typical

279
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,680
deployment in enterprise scenarios
because it's easier to manage like I

280
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,490
mention from what we've seen as typical
deployments also BIOS is sometimes

281
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,640
locked sometimes not lock down users can
sometimes go in and make changes and

282
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,240
there's usually not a lot of restriction
on the power states of the machine

283
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,960
meaning obviously machine can be on or
off but it's up to the user to decide

284
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,890
whether they want to put a machine to
sleep or they want to put a hibernation

285
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,090
mode there's not a lot of enforcement
around that so the last thing before we

286
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,959
go into actual actual attacks that we we
we found out we talked briefly about the

287
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,240
previous work in the software encryption

288
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,170
there's been the tax recovery and
encryption keys from the computer itself

289
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,790
so cold blood attacks or side channel
attacks other techniques has been

290
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,899
device to bypass the Windows
authentication so the DMA attacks for

291
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,140
example the inception told that you
connect over the firewire bus and you're

292
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,720
just overriding memory and then you're
bypassing the login screen so if you

293
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,240
have access to a machine with the login
screen even if the disk is full disk

294
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,990
encrypt it if you can have access to the
window session and as be have a user

295
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,530
access you can probably elevate yourself
to admin privileges or any we read the

296
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,910
data that the user can read and there's
actually a part that's going to happen

297
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:54,650
tomorrow that that guy over there is
doing which I don't know I just read the

298
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,810
abstract but it seems really fun so you
should probably go with that as well

299
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,909
those are from my understanding under
that's another technique to bypass the

300
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,630
Windows authentication so that will
allow you to bypass the full disk

301
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,180
encryption such as BitLocker that might
be in place and then there's the evil

302
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,090
made a tax we're just switch the laptop
worth the drive by something else for

303
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,679
you have a piece of software that's
loaded the first that captures the keys

304
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,760
and then there's just triggers the
standard method then feed the key data

305
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,740
just captured then at the same time
recovering ducky either another visit or

306
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,820
through other mechanisms sold at work
that has been done for the software full

307
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,909
disk encryption mode for self-encrypting
drives there's two things that are worth

308
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,690
mentioning one is research for the other
security mode where Mueller discovered

309
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,630
the way that's called the hotline attack
attack and we're gonna explored in the

310
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,860
context of all parts when I'm gonna see
me a lot about it right now but we're

311
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,659
gonna see it in action and then there's
been research for the customer

312
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,240
implementations Western Digital the
paper that

313
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,809
has been published a month or two ago by
Alan doll and tenders

314
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,990
CISS company that there are a bunch of
research on proprietary encryption on

315
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,030
USB thumb drives what are we gonna
presence here we're gonna present

316
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,178
vulnerabilities that relate to said swim
managed in an enterprise environment so

317
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,090
that means open mode and also we drive
from bit longer because that's readily

318
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,290
available and it's very similar to opal
and we're gonna focus on laptop

319
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,520
scenarios you've noticed we have a
couple of laptops here for the demos but

320
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,150
this is in Curia pluggable to other
scenarios as well you could say these

321
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,870
attacks may be slightly extend them and
use them in the context of said that are

322
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,689
used in a data center for servers so now
that we've established that we're going

323
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,390
to talk about said in open if we see the
details a bit of how those are parade

324
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:57,050
you know I mentioned there was a system
error in the system area of a drive what

325
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,200
we usually have are the TCG tables so
this is where you have the media

326
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,040
encryption key that its itself encrypted
in your gonna have some configuration

327
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,559
tables in settings and so on then
there's the area which is the shot OMB

328
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,610
are so this is where your software your
pre-booked application software will

329
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,919
reside and this is what's loaded when
you pull on your computer and blue

330
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,429
signifies that it's clear Texas not
encrypted and then again you're gonna

331
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,420
have the user encrypted user data which
is encrypted and always encrypted as I

332
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,160
mentioned in this data is encrypted with
the make the meeting

333
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,929
Frankie now this diagram is just a
simplification of the actual details but

334
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:41,870
it turns out you can have multiple areas
and each of this area to be equipped

335
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,590
with a different key so you might have a
scenario where you have to users can log

336
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,459
into a machine in the indication and
depending on the credentials that they

337
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,380
log on with they could see it completely
different tribes and completely

338
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,950
different day time the other parts could
be encrypted so even though didn't user

339
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:05,870
would not to the data from the other
user the way the drives work opal drives

340
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,739
work and it applies to someone

341
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,640
the security or customs traditions as
well is that the drives can typically be

342
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,800
in three states the first date is when
the drive is office powered off so you

343
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,980
have the drive sitting on the table the
drive is one in a state that's called

344
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,309
locked so that means the media
encryption key is encrypted sit on the

345
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:34,600
drive encrypted but nowhere in the live
memory of the controller then when you

346
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,590
power on the drive the drives gonna
switch to one on moment but also locked

347
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,280
so the directors receive spyware but at
this state it's only the MBR shadowing

348
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,350
the previous software that is visible
the drive exploded this in the read only

349
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,209
mode so if you power on the drive you're
not going to be able to alter the

350
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,950
contents of the pre boot you just gonna
be able to read that and then the user

351
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,110
will authenticating this previewed
software and based on the management

352
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,899
software the software will either the
right to use based on the username and

353
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,670
password or use the 2 p.m. or whatever
other mechanism is in place to obtain

354
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,960
the key encryption key decrypt media
encryption key and then unlock the drive

355
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,070
so was the drive is unlocked

356
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,960
this is the state we want to be in at
that stage the previous indication part

357
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,760
becomes invisible so the only thing that
you will see is the user data and over

358
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,700
the SATA interface design an encrypted
so even if you were to image the

359
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,800
driver's seat with some forensic tools
you will only see the user data and you

360
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,230
would that they don't appear to be
unencrypted now the one thing that's

361
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,540
very interesting is once you move the
drive to the on unlock state and you

362
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,530
have access to the data on the drive
will remain in that state until either

363
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,700
one of the following conditions happened
either you power off for power cycle the

364
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,890
drive so you removed the power or you
explicitly said the Dr yet indication

365
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,910
comment to the dr so unless there is a
Dr commands into the drive if you're

366
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,250
maintaining power to drive the drive
will remain unlocked and the operating

367
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,430
system or another operating system or

368
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,670
the system will see the date on that
drive and this is what will be will be

369
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,460
exploiting and at first it seemed weird
that the drive operate that way but in

370
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,060
fact it turns out that if we go back to
the global standard

371
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,700
SSC use cases and threat the standard
mentions that eight

372
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,600
the use cases to protect the
confidentiality of stored data against

373
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,000
unauthorized access once it leaves the
owner's control and they describe that

374
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,620
as involving a power cycle and
subsequent to that means pretty much if

375
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,750
you remove the drive from the laptop or
you should trigger at the office hard

376
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,640
power off the laptop that's when the old
policies meant to protect the drive if

377
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,180
you have your computer on the no police
not meant to protect the drive against

378
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,240
that state and as we'll see in a second
if you have your computer in sleep mode

379
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,500
even though the drive is powered ask
opal is not going to protect against at

380
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:21,640
state so what we're seeing what we're
gonna attacks are things that apply to

381
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,130
our knowledge to all of the Opel
deployments with a couple of vendors for

382
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:34,120
drives Samsung seagate hard drives SSDs
different laptop models different brands

383
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,919
different management software with the
laptop was on or in sleep mode and found

384
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,720
that it this applies in all of those
cases with a couple of exceptions so

385
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,440
it's not a problem with the way the
vendors implemented the standard there's

386
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,910
not a flaw in the implementation or
they're missing parts of the standard

387
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,270
that they haven't implemented is just
that the standard is not meant to

388
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:02,800
protect against will be showing here in
this presentation so we've seen a bit

389
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,120
about house its work I talked about the
previous work that's being done well it

390
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,610
turns out that some of the previous work
that has been done for the software

391
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,629
encryption also apply for the states are
specifically for the city no promote so

392
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,690
bypassing Windows authentication issue
have a laptop with the stated that you

393
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,570
sleep mode or powered on if the screen
is locked and you're going to show us

394
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,220
how we can bypass when the competition
tomorrow regardless of whether that

395
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,200
software encrypted or or hardware
encrypted you're gonna be able to have

396
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,559
access to your liking it

397
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,470
that the user and you're reading that
they even made a tax once again can be

398
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,749
can can be made to work for something
dresses well and then the word from

399
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:45,350
Mueller for the security mode the
hotplug attack it turns out that it also

400
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,029
works for opal Dr

401
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:52,090
that type of attack in particular before
we show you the three other attacks that

402
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,330
we devised there are new to our
knowledge so how the hot dog attack

403
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:01,928
works is if the laptop is on first thing
that you just put it to sleep in sleep

404
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:07,210
mode and at this this state when you
change the drive from on to sleep mode

405
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,860
the drive going to get powered off some
components of the laptop will remain

406
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,019
power you on memory will be refreshed
but the drive is powered off so dry the

407
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:20,399
drive will switch to one and locked
state so then what you do is remove the

408
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,508
drive from the laptop so now the laptop
is killing off and lock state you

409
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:28,009
install a bunch of saddam extension
cables as you want to play with the

410
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:32,570
connectors on the drive interest not
enough room in space and the laptop and

411
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,610
then you wake up the machine from sleep
so when you wake up from sleep first

412
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,869
thing the dress gonna receive power so
we switched on and locked and then the

413
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:47,860
software that's being in memory when you
wake up the machine will automatically

414
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,479
unlock the drive and once again
depending on the management software

415
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,240
that you're using you can either be a
password that stored somewhere in memory

416
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,679
allocated or not it can be a combination
of using 2 p.m. to gain access to the

417
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,269
keys it could initially even use some
network communication although we

418
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:09,460
haven't really seen that doesn't matter
how it happens in all the cases that

419
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,639
we've seen the software automatically
unlocks the drive when you wake up from

420
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:19,279
sleep mode cuz you're gonna have to log
into Windows anyway so there is a login

421
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,509
screen theater the sector's going to
decrypt the driver on like to drive

422
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:28,039
automatically though so now we have the
driving the blue on luck state at this

423
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,600
stage we have the laptop drive out with
extension cables we're gonna keep power

424
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,919
to it we're going to switch the SATA
connection

425
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,510
and the when you switch the connection
you're gonna have access to the machine

426
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:48,080
at the Dr actually so I'm gonna go and
then today I have been said that there

427
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,610
was a black had our main to fail but
have also said that people expect them

428
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,969
more than they expect them to fail so
let's see this is probably gonna be fun

429
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,070
to have a set up here with the camera
and I'm gonna show you all the work that

430
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:15,210
I'm going to do on the laptop but said
that up first

431
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:36,260
ok so what I have and I have that we're
gonna used to gain access to the drive

432
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:42,370
and then I'm just gonna open Explorer
here which is where we're hopefully

433
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:55,500
going to see the Dr appear ok so let's
start this is the laptop with with the

434
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,500
stud that comes to your just gonna show
you all power on the laptop this is the

435
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,840
previous indication so in this case were
having BitLocker with ppm and pin set up

436
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:10,330
so I'm just gonna that's not the right
pin so we can see right away when most

437
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:23,169
fail correct been ok this is the right
then there we go

438
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:31,540
so now we're into Windows I have my John
Smith user error so let's receive this

439
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:43,270
is an old version of Windows Windows
standards have been applied as of last

440
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,850
night

441
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,030
12:14 so seems to be pretty recent

442
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:52,770
patched up the drive is encrypted with
BitLocker how can you tell you see the

443
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:58,450
siloxane over here but if you don't
believe me we can see the details by

444
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,160
running to manage biddy command so this
is where we see that the drive is

445
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:11,210
encrypted let me just read our justice a
bit so we see it better so we see that

446
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,070
the drive is fully encrypted hardware
encryption which means the drives in

447
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:21,020
RAID mode so it's not a software-based
encryption on and lock status on locks

448
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,820
on the drive right now is on and on like
steak so this is what a normal user with

449
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,060
the power on their machine and the user
has a document on the desktop this is

450
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,860
the doctor going to try to access which
is a sample file so then the user will

451
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,870
lock their machine and either put it to
sleep or leave it on the attacker I

452
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,179
stepped in I find the machine effect on
the machine on and we're going to put

453
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,480
the machine to sleep if the machine is
in sleep mode no problem under just

454
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,620
gonna use it that way so then what I'm
gonna do it I'm going to install

455
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,600
extension cables and just move this
laptop out of the way for now so I'm

456
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,000
gonna open the driver's compartment
replace the screws with duct tape

457
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,890
opening get to every five minutes it's
easier to remove

458
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm gonna get my drive on here for now
so I have this extension cable this is

459
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,770
data and power extension cable we only
need that they don't but that's the the

460
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,560
longer ones have empowered that iPhones
on just any use those this is where you

461
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,170
want to use that as well for your tables
because if you remove the cables while

462
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,300
you're trying to do the demo and black
had to trust me it's not going to work

463
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,940
so what I'm gonna do now is forth from
this cable that came from the laptop I'm

464
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:51,560
gonna plug their connection to the dr
and this is where I'll be using my

465
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,779
external USB to SATA adapter and for now
I will just be supplying power to the

466
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:06,390
drive from this adapter so I turned this
on I'm supplying power in now that's the

467
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:14,220
day I still connected to the laptop so
powering on the laptop powered on

468
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,029
so this is where the Dr gets unlocked
and now what we do is I will remove the

469
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,640
satellite data not only the laptop
anymore

470
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,350
nothing's going to the laptop the dress
not there if I try to login the laptop

471
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:35,360
will either freeze or crash and this is
where i plug in to my usb adapter you

472
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,320
here in the blink blink the driver
Pierce here so you see the completed the

473
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,060
other laptop crashed doesn't matter I
have access to the drive and then we can

474
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,810
go in that users desktop and I have
access to that drive right now even

475
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:54,750
though the drive

476
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:16,010
so what was interesting

477
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:24,200
all of the laptops were vulnerable
except for Lenovo laptops that in the

478
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,009
laptops were not the modern ones they
detected when the drive was removed the

479
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,930
set of data cable was removed from the
laptop while the laptop was in sleep

480
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,259
mode and what we found is that for Opel
drives that's not the case we confirmed

481
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,630
that in other security mode yes the
Lenovo laptops do that but for Opel

482
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,490
drives you don't have that protection
and what's the reason for that is the

483
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,629
security dry since the biostats
unlocking and locking the drive sold the

484
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,820
laptop can easily decide not willing to
drive anymore if it detects that the

485
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,720
stock cable has been stretched but for
Opel drives is the management software

486
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,189
in this case it was BitLocker in Windows
that was resume from sleep that unlike

487
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:08,470
the drive for the laptop itself didn't
think to say there of what to do well

488
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,919
there are a couple of things that can be
done from a user perspective first thing

489
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,610
to do is if you leave your laptop and
attended don't leave your laptop on or

490
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:25,010
in sleep mode power off or hibernated I
did ministers they can consider

491
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,060
disabling the sleep mode or restricting
the sleep mode for example the laptop

492
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,299
can be sleep mode but not for more than
15 minutes or ten minutes just for

493
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,840
walking around from one room to another
order can be some geographical fencing

494
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,010
so if you get out of the office or on
that network then laptops going to power

495
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,150
off or hybrid right away the laptop
manufacturers even though the drive is

496
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,040
not in the security mode could attempt
to detect if I Drive was removed while

497
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,090
the laptop was in sleep mode and then if
that's the case triggered a hard reset

498
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,470
of the machine power cycle the drive and
and and flush the memory so that way the

499
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,459
software is not loaded and the softer
would not only

500
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,990
radically the drive and then the set
manufacturers could consider detecting

501
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,979
when we're switching the son of data
cable from one computer to the other and

502
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,830
if they detect that while the drive is
powered on to lock the drive so that way

503
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,580
that they are not accessible there
anymore so this was something that was

504
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,950
not you know we're gonna see three other
techniques but just one of them will be

505
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,350
at the moment we don't have a lot of
time of other things we can do the next

506
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:38,130
one is the force restart attack so in
this case if the laptop is in sleep mode

507
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,350
we're just gonna wait the laptop up we
want to have the laptop running then

508
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,529
we're going to trigger a soft reset the
laptop the drive will be on an unlocked

509
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,220
phone that this state then we're going
to boot from a different source and then

510
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,470
we're gonna have access to the data so
you're gonna ask how ru triggering a

511
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,640
soft reset on the laptop on the desktop
is pretty easy lot of the times you have

512
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,430
a button to trigger reset that's called
a hard reset though but on the laptop

513
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,310
how would you go around that well it
turns out that there is a tool phased

514
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:16,150
answer and I have we're gonna hear that
can sniff and replay a USB traffic and

515
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,790
there is a fellow and Andy Davis from
the NCC group that presented it to let

516
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,050
black had last year

517
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:27,120
map that can actually stimulate USB
devices from Python directly from this

518
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,230
hardware gadget and there are a couple
of bucks in modern operating systems

519
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,710
where if you have physical access to a
machine to a USB port you can send some

520
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:44,750
USB commander gonna trigger a restart
and crashed a machine there's also the

521
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,930
option of just sorting some memory pins
I've done that multiple times i wasnt I

522
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:55,160
didn't break anything in the computer
just a word of caution you might try the

523
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,060
memory stick or the motherboard one of
our colleagues Danny guard will text you

524
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,620
saw me playing with the screwdriver into
the computer and he said why don't you

525
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,380
just remove the memory stick and yes it
turns out they're removing the memory

526
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,150
stick has less chances of damaging
something though the components and it

527
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,910
triggers a soft reset as well in most
cases

528
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:19,680
good luck applying a patch for that we
see in a couple of cases were just by

529
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,710
plugging gaming keyboard with the monks
in the USB DVI and switching from one

530
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,619
party to the other just consistently
triggers crashes in windows and then

531
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,230
there is the feature in Windows where
you can actually trigger a crash

532
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,260
controlled crash control scroll scroll
lock you have to be an admin the ginger

533
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,680
registry key but this is something
really helpful if you're doing testing

534
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,848
and want to see how your computer
behaves especially in the context of

535
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:51,119
said if you're triggering a crash so
we're gonna see the second demo which is

536
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,250
the blue screen of death it's easy just
to remove a memory stick

537
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,430
we're gonna do the final one though with
the face dancer and we're going to cause

538
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:09,480
a crash of the machine now there is a
paper that comes with our research that

539
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,190
will be published on the black hat site
that actually describes the commands

540
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:18,470
that you can run and the actual test
cases from you map that you can use to

541
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:25,020
crash a fully-fledged windows 8
enterprise I tested all of those before

542
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,538
coming here to Amsterdam and all of them
still appear to work on Windows 8

543
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:36,839
enterprise however none of them work on
Windows 10 turns out though that there

544
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:41,520
is another test case in that tool in the
you map that can crash a window stand

545
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:49,099
the cold that crashes and fully patched
was not disclosed in the responsible

546
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:53,079
disclosure in the article so I'm going
to mask some of the values here but was

547
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,410
gonna see our full patch windows 10
crash and access to the ACD so this is

548
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:14,440
just as before

549
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:39,859
so up to date as of last night and
something here

550
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:58,160
so prepare my door

551
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:27,629
so what I will crash case was not
prepared actually have to trigger hit

552
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,119
f12 to trigger a boost from an
alternative source and this is where I'm

553
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,920
plugging the USB thumb drive to the
machine so we're gonna see the machinery

554
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:50,030
start asking here

555
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,050
you notice that I gotta be camera with
the focus ring so that I can have

556
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:58,110
another thing to play with while I'm
doing the normal sobering from the

557
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:10,060
alternative source

558
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:28,200
gonna get there

559
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,569
so right now we're all of this is
happening the drive was always on always

560
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:43,430
in an unlock state

561
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:51,850
just increase the font size

562
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,670
so if I just list

563
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:00,270
the petitions that I haven't addressed a
half I can see that is the case for this

564
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:33,109
is my data partition from the window
stand so I'm just gonna mounted so we

565
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:41,690
found that all of the classic vulnerable
to this the one that we tested it was

566
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:47,660
interesting to see that the Lenovo
laptops when used with an easy drive are

567
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,730
not vulnerable so whenever the machine
is even soft reset then we go through

568
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:57,859
the process of selecting the different
growth method for using each drive the

569
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:01,700
drive will get locked in you will not be
able to use this technique in that

570
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,808
scenario what can you do as a user
against the same thing I did ministers

571
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:10,530
can change the setting does by default
in Windows to automatically restarted

572
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,680
there's the crash so you could remove
that too that way your users when they

573
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,299
come back to work in the morning they
will see the nice crashes on their

574
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:23,200
machines also BIOS was not lock down
here not only could go into BIOS and

575
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,460
change settings by default they can use
the the key to choose a different method

576
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,900
make sure to disable those USB device
external devices network could do

577
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,819
something that we usually see on so
disabled as well and then there's the

578
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:42,089
recommendations from the laptop
manufacturers to force a power cycle on

579
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:46,578
the drive when the machine is being
restarted and also the always developers

580
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:51,589
to reconsider the impact of
vulnerabilities that can crusher machine

581
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:54,450
when you have local access to the
machine cause right now in the context

582
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,368
of studs we can read the data on the
drive that way

583
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:04,430
another technique is the hot unplug
attack so the hot unplugged attack is

584
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,149
just like the like the hotplug attack
but on steroids

585
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:13,800
to suppose a laptop manufacturer comes
up with a way to detect that the side

586
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,420
extension cable is plugged in 12 driving
in sleep mode and blocks you from doing

587
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,370
that what you can actually do is the
following you expose the setup

588
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:27,750
instrument drive in the laptop
compartment so what you would do is you

589
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,910
have though the dry here with just the
cover off you slightly pull it over and

590
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:37,740
you can see the pins and then you for
supply power to the dr while it's in

591
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:43,700
this mode I just took a side extension
peeled off the plastic to have access of

592
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,520
the pins and then you push to put this
on the drive I have they are in power

593
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,600
here but I'm always supplying power at
this point and now with the power supply

594
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,720
to the dr you remove the drive from the
case from the laptop and then you just

595
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,240
connect the satellite data cable and
once again you have access this is a bit

596
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,359
tricky make sure to place your pins the
right spot I burnt the drive will when I

597
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,150
was just one playoff in sending power on
the wrong things so we just decided to

598
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:21,380
someone drive you the one we burned and
the 512 in 2012 precious 22 to destroy

599
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,080
this way but we don't expect any of the
configurations to not be vulnerable to

600
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,080
this anything that is vulnerable to
attack the hotplug would be vulnerable

601
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,410
to this one as well and pretty much the
same recommendations here for the users

602
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,140
in the laptop manufacturers as well as
the said rice to detect when we're

603
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,720
switching the sod data cable and finally
the last technique the key capture

604
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,899
attack this is something that we just
resent theoretically we haven't actually

605
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,220
tested it but the idea behind this is to
capture the key that's being sent the

606
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,759
drive to the dr caption that indication
come out so one way of doing that would

607
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,610
be to get a hard drive that you can
flash the firmware off and have your own

608
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,260
forum where there have it masquerade as
legitimate driving force in the same

609
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,750
serial number model size and so on and
then captured the commands with the key

610
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,830
encryption key store that somewhere and
then use that to unlock your drive so

611
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,470
either do it that way or use the sawdust
necessary for the actual driving that's

612
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,078
being locked you want in any way you
will get the

613
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:22,410
the the key and then you'll be able to
be able to unlock to drive home anytime

614
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:30,038
soon want we've seen a couple of ways in
which you can attack seds like having

615
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:33,239
mentioned within a couple of medications
as well but if you ask yourself the

616
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:38,039
question have I been hacked have been
attacked having been popped if we look

617
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:42,519
at the four attacks it turns out that
it's very difficult to find out if

618
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:47,578
you've been under attack the hot plug
unplug and the capture leave no traces

619
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,799
retreated a similar to some hold
hardware malfunction that forced restart

620
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:55,059
attack indeed the traces of the blue
screen of death and you will have the

621
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:59,200
windows and memory dumps but at the end
of the day if the attacker gets access

622
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,618
to the drive-in manages to unlock it
they can clean up any of those traces on

623
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:06,440
when they put the drive back you're not
going to know that there was a problem

624
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:12,059
with the drive so finally before we wrap
up a couple of words on the responsible

625
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:15,869
disclosure we've been in communication
with the TCG Trusted Computing Group

626
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:21,200
disclosed the findings on July 15 and by
common agreement they to the task of

627
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,229
sharing all of this information or the
relevant parts of this information with

628
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:29,288
all of the members from the store tour
group we've also work research to

629
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:33,019
disclose the vulnerability we've been
assigned vulnerability note from them

630
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:38,279
and 3 C's for the attacks that we have
actually shown that work not the

631
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:42,430
theoretical one and then Lenovo were
kind enough to contact us and say oh we

632
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,709
want to know more about this how does
this work and help out those details and

633
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:49,549
we had a couple of discussions with them
on potential mitigation is that they

634
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:54,670
might deploy in the future in their
laptops

635
00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:12,320
looking at the demos returns back to
your organization's after the conference

636
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,610
and the organizational management asked
you saw a lot of new attacks what do we

637
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,100
need to be secure as part of the 2016
budgets make sure to state you need a

638
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,650
face dancer and duct tape as Daniel
showed if anyone actually has the guts

639
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,870
to do that let us know what the response
is a management team reach out to us by

640
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:39,049
social media or or email so much I and
not stand in front of the of the slide

641
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,170
here but when we look at this
possibility it's interesting the

642
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,230
exploits that were shown here we're
primarily focus on enterprise

643
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:51,270
environments and specifically at laptops
when trying to find information on what

644
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:55,170
the impact of such vulnerabilities would
be there is an older study that actually

645
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,190
it's cut out here about by the Ponemon
Institute and Intel regarding laptop so

646
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,460
number one we see the circle Hara 263
laptop stolen each year per organization

647
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:12,900
and that's an average based on complex a
complex simulation are complex surveys

648
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,400
the word I'm looking for a complex
survey that the executed and the cost

649
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,680
based on replacing the hardware and
based on the information that was on the

650
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,200
laptop is just under $50,000 in this
study was from a few years ago if we

651
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,879
look at it so it's been quite a few
changes since a study was put out if we

652
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,480
see on this side the number of laptops
has increased in terms of the number of

653
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,150
devices in use within the organization
as well as the cost for each incident

654
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:46,460
has definitely gone up and the primary
reason for that is number 12 sides of

655
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,900
the desk in the datasets looking
specifically at the amount of money per

656
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:56,640
per loss based on an incident laptops
have bigger drives a lot of people have

657
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,210
more sensitive information

658
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,040
the costs associated with this
information is deathly gone up the value

659
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,360
of the sense of information as well has
increased and is also a requirement for

660
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,620
organizations to action

661
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,870
notify people in the event of an
intrusion then there were when the study

662
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:15,799
came out so in terms of impact
specifically number one

663
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,110
organizations who have suffered whether
it's a loss or theft of a laptop who do

664
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:24,030
have a CDS who assumed that you know
what the information was protected made

665
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:29,270
you may need to revisit some of those
cases and whether that's external and

666
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:32,690
you went through legal whether it was a
public breach whether this is just an

667
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:36,660
internal or NHRA issue that's something
to look at as well as what's the

668
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,080
likelihood of someone leveraging some of
this information to actually go back and

669
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,279
get access to information that you
thought was protected and as well you

670
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,700
can expect to see an increase in the
number of the laptop thefts that we're

671
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,390
seeing in the industry is again D
self-encrypting drives and similar

672
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,750
technology has been put out their
organizations have been investing in

673
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,580
them again there is no downside as we've
seen somebody tax Daniel show there are

674
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,040
quite a few downsides associate with the
technology now as part of targeted tax I

675
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,450
can target one of the administrators we
heard that the keynote today and if you

676
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:12,160
can get admin privileges what
organization would involve victim to

677
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,480
that so you can actually find
individuals targeting these laptops you

678
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,110
can get access to the drive and you can
now sir to carve out the credentials

679
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:24,010
from the drive and user credentials to
actually execute a more sophisticated

680
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:29,410
attack you can expect to see the number
of a laptop related incidents rise as

681
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:37,629
well as the costs associated with
information on these on these drives

682
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:43,450
just got a five minute warning and she's
looking kind of thing you got to be on

683
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:53,839
time so the the format for the black hat
conference is that again they will be

684
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,799
three sound bites for each conference so
the ones that you can do the three key

685
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,769
points you can take all the way from
this conference is that said in typical

686
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:09,609
enterprise to prompt deployment which is
open are insecure by design when the

687
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:15,180
laptop is on or in sleep old that's just
how they've been designed the standard

688
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,058
has been designed there's things you can
do a rounded to mitigate the risk is

689
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:22,759
that users can do things that I'd
administrators can do differently in the

690
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:27,720
future things that can be done by the
industry to improve the situation but if

691
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,269
you are worried that you might have been
attacked or your organization might have

692
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:36,410
been under attack and and data on the
drive has been compromised

693
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,109
there is very little you can do to
actually detected or prove that you've

694
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:44,980
been under that attack so you're better
off protecting in the first place cuz

695
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,529
you're not going to be able to tell that
you've been attacked or not after the

696
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:53,180
fact and they believe we have two
minutes or so for questions now anybody

697
00:56:53,180 --> 00:57:11,399
has any questions yes question in the
back

698
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:17,900
the question was surrounding the laptop
that might detect the SATA cables out

699
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:23,359
there are people being changed when the
laptop is in sleep mode and then not

700
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:28,270
unlocking the drive so just to clarify
that is the case right now for Lenovo

701
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:33,270
laptops for drives using the security
moment for Opel drives that's not being

702
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:39,750
implemented howie's exactly that's being
done I don't have all of the details but

703
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:44,670
my suspicion is that the memories
refreshers to some power going through

704
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:49,160
the drive controller and is the drive
control order some mechanism there that

705
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:54,990
detects that the connection has been
changed its not a physical thing where

706
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:58,939
you have a button that the text that you
change that even if you have the data

707
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:05,829
connection of the of the data on an
extension plug somewhere further away

708
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:08,890
from the laptop it will still get the
texts so it's somewhere at the

709
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:13,308
electrical later and then you can do you
no longer have the the contact with the

710
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:22,040
drive electrical contact

711
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:28,180
so the question was is there any
forensic evidence W we can look at a

712
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,680
receipt that would they were told that
this attack was not as I mentioned a

713
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,950
couple of slides ago there are some
things that are left behind especially

714
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,220
if you're triggering the blue screen of
death

715
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,220
you could see that yesterday's evidence
that the machine crashed on approach

716
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:47,879
with this code now we get accurate
sloppy that might be left behind but if

717
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,330
the attacker has access to the dr
detecting just cleaned up so no we

718
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:57,430
haven't really seen any of those
telltale signs and I've just been 20

719
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:57,940
minutes

720
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,980
sign if you have any questions feel free
to grab us after the talk more than

721
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,820
happy to answer them thank you
