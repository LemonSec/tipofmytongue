1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
my nemesis kitchen and this is my
colleague in town hall where upper on

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:16,230
316 316 and we are very glad to be here
today we are gonna to give a topic

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:25,359
the advanced explosion of Internet
Explorer

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:33,989
this early this year we attended as the
pentagon contest in Vancouver and we

5
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:41,780
target Internet Explorer 64 bit and we
finally succeeds succeeded in the target

6
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:49,539
there are some significant changes this
year site for example of this is the

7
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:59,770
first year that 46 Pete 64 bits Internet
Explorer is used as a target this means

8
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:06,920
men exploit technical such as simple
cheap spring we're not work

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:18,299
64 bit explorer and also this year's
contest enables see enhanced the pro-tec

10
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,479
to move the Internet Explorer which
means we have to we achieved a remote

11
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,080
code execution

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:37,030
we still need to buy process and the box
to win the skin and what's more the

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:44,210
previous CEO of Microsoft has had added
a min exploit communications such as he

14
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:52,679
isolated to keep the effort to free and
these medications are very efficient and

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:02,210
the cure them any use for parks which
can be can be used originally so as soon

16
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:10,288
as it opens CEO Sharkey Peko said this
year's phone to alan is a joke

17
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,119
reduce the price but

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:22,760
the difficult to increase very very much
by the way this year's prize full I is

19
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,179
sixty sixty-five thousand and last two
years

20
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:36,890
100,000 but this series much more
difficult than nice here but we do not

21
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:45,179
want to wait for next year so we decided
to take these chains and fortunately we

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,950
finally succeeded in a challenge and so
today we are we want to give some

23
00:02:51,950 --> 00:03:00,970
sharing about our abilities we used our
exploits as aware as a technique used to

24
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:13,840
finally take down the Explorer so this
is our agenda today basically we have

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,349
two parts since we used to 20 they run
abilities seeing the contest there so we

26
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,599
have two parts the first part two we
were introduced the first 20 day which

27
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:35,768
is see the 2015 and 1745 this is I think
he should light snow memory used to

28
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:44,030
achieve remote code execution the ie
sandbox process and the second is we

29
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,079
were introduced another their day we
used to buy posse enhance the protected

30
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:59,290
the mood of Internet Explorer and this
is Reece condition in the ie broker

31
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:12,138
service who are we we are researchers
for also is 61 team 360 is the largest

32
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:20,560
Internet security company in China and
basically we do security research is an

33
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,510
ability research

34
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:34,500
apt take action and security software
and we have fun as it is and also we

35
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,810
attended to sound needy patients by
Paris reward points and we have spoken

36
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:52,880
several security conferences ok let's
start our to this topic

37
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
the first part two we were introduced II
initializing memory book and how we use

38
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,880
this to achieve remote code execution
and we know we're preventing this

39
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:16,580
product for you

40
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:56,680
ok to achieve remote code is closed so
by way of memory corruption boxes when

41
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,270
you are very own ride program do about
that

42
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:09,008
memory and video programming use local
Rabbo global variable dynamical ok then

43
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:16,699
you know program we are setting to the
memory plate so program this memory date

44
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:32,509
but before in the unpredictable results
and I like the memory back here to the

45
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:41,930
first one we allocate we are located in
hurry with a diamond shape and we start

46
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,900
to their first tournament of this story
but without in Nashville at eight so

47
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:56,279
that is the memory back on the hip and
see the Second Life we have in hurry we

48
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:02,659
leave a comment on the state this time
and still we owe that to the first

49
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:07,639
element of mystery without nationalizing
this time

50
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,260
pepsico naturalized a local airport back

51
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:22,940
I am naturalized memory Park are common
in program and the mandate

52
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,690
many parts of this county history they
are men in that box as you can see here

53
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm not stop male / also those who don't
know how this kind of Parks and Rec back

54
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:51,989
they feel that they allocate memory
block your phone if memory block and if

55
00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:00,690
you have that memory memory broke out in
natural light they got the boat is

56
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:08,640
thought you would you thought I national
memory take a similar to that you got on

57
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,260
the tree and the Tegra 3 2008 you find
their the back there there's a left by

58
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,510
the previous partner maybe by you cannot
directly you this back because it's not

59
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:36,620
a are doing really too bad it out i mean
maybe the bone and our part we funded by

60
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,730
14 it is crossed by the attribute value
of the attribute re this time that the

61
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:55,570
attribute value it right back in that it
right back to bed the previous partner

62
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,740
so you know that element

63
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:12,980
HTML attributes you cast that attribute
to element using Skype calling apologize

64
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:25,280
I should be attributable you underline
text that actually the a tributary

65
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:39,520
name in the case data object that
contains contact 3-3 attribute values we

66
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,310
need to go deeper deeper into the
attribute value and see a tributary

67
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:55,219
better understanding of the applied for
that later he attributed value and value

68
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:04,330
attributable you actually very their top
which means it can't ask various top of

69
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:14,380
this the petty in the the attribute
value is important because it indicates

70
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:24,600
the type of this attribute so you can
beat it up if for example if the video

71
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:37,700
tab is eight this attribute should be as
TR three out of the last look at it and

72
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:46,520
we create a div element and attribute to
the element let's have a look as a

73
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,189
merited of the CD I V element in the
packer

74
00:10:51,190 --> 00:11:00,780
you can see there you see a tributary of
the investee div element we pouring into

75
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,020
the the attribute the reach and if they
can't get another printer parts are real

76
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,889
menace II attribute values

77
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:18,819
so we first the attribute value you can
see it here it is effectively the

78
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:26,699
attribute of you trust the south with
CTAB element and weep at 88 reaching the

79
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:34,469
affected you should be str tribute and
if you see the value type sorry you feel

80
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:50,679
bound to be STR three simple template
pack plz plz up our park we have two

81
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,379
element here

82
00:11:52,379 --> 00:12:01,439
their first 18 element in the document
and second party at least at some

83
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:08,309
attribute to this to adamant that we
called the polish and murder a tribute

84
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:14,929
to the the first murder attributes we
are much all the attributes of this to

85
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:23,829
adamant to New created the active
military and so the party i cant a new

86
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:25,979
created the attribute re

87
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:32,639
this car and the part in the
implementation of this culture i mean

88
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:49,049
the palliative murder are to be created
the attribute hurry just escaped without

89
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:57,449
being nationalized so kind as well as
dusty attributed by Lou which can be

90
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,459
accessed in javascript

91
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:14,700
to crowd the park we have that without
being weaker lot directly you keep spree

92
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,280
6438 Internet Explorer so we need to
leave the address I'll come up there are

93
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,620
some interesting object after the league
we we are about to make any cattle pick

94
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,010
up with you so we can chill I between
right now sorry become a tree to

95
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:43,970
arbitrary by making a fake a tribute
concert have become a to be treated by

96
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:51,350
making out fake crab in theory military
to read and write I between memory

97
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,740
because that our job code and the best
part of DA party a.m. EDT finally RCE

98
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:16,960
gotta do more code is cursed ok let's go
through each that in detail for us to be

99
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,300
able to control in the national anthem
memory because this is unnatural as the

100
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,390
memory park we cannot that are at eight
per there's a natural as the memory

101
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:38,550
block is located yes that we should
control that they before they locate

102
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:50,760
reach me at the issues that are out
there in previous location

103
00:14:50,760 --> 00:15:01,660
we allocate memory products they buy and
sell it to be the content we need we

104
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:09,560
three people here although provides free
but the content of people there remains

105
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:21,500
because of the implementation and in
that we take our park and the national

106
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,360
anthem memory block they'd be happy to
locate here if you like me to just be

107
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,950
allocated in the memory that for a baby
but this time I national memory

108
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:44,450
be to actually we are said to the state
lab but I which is controlled by

109
00:15:44,450 --> 00:16:01,940
deephouse to fully control the
naturalist memory about it is obviously

110
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,140
we and the people who should be
allocated on the heap the second the

111
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:17,500
contact of people should not be cleared
up there is very little depend on the

112
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,590
code implementation

113
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:30,740
great memory protect free then the
contact of the obvious that to go after

114
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:39,980
provides free our control before the
content of people should not be set to

115
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,130
third row 22 it looking there they will
also depend on the podium let the

116
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:58,220
implementation to allocate these seemed
a lock people up and he there are no

117
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,910
memory of plaque that our control of
people

118
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:12,670
for totally our memory controller
because the attribute artery is

119
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,330
allocated by cardiac puncture people
located about the visit of this blacks

120
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:26,790
that we thought he reflects that so
lucky

121
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:33,620
controlled the date the attribute value
I mean I nashville has the attribute

122
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:42,110
value of your choice that greta is what
they should be used to billion they'd be

123
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:51,439
attributed value our plan is to meet
epub 2008 have that the change of date

124
00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:04,090
though we need to value appealed to the
memory or try protein 3208 Internet

125
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:10,360
Explorer it would it would be simple
because because because a lot of memory

126
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:21,419
block party in 2003 be spread like a
drug

127
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:29,130
back think people are paid I this kind
of his previous not work as we said

128
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:39,040
before

129
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:48,240
of 202 Control Number 8 830 address pot

130
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,440
yes they are paid for that the memory
address they they thought that you how

131
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,470
to three more than 50 Kb this to do this
to do the same thing and I think it is

132
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,680
impossible

133
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:20,060
information leaked first Apr Park a good
enough then you can directly address of

134
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:28,780
interesting object but they've come
through hell and everyone don't start

135
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:36,210
you don't have a car parked there is
another way to leave the address of some

136
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:45,320
object in the same heap and come back to
be some kind of keep from 30 per day if

137
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,760
you will be able to address our updated
you are interesting and there's a lot of

138
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:04,510
what we do to our back we carried that
it was free to do the information leaked

139
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:13,410
allocate some attribute hurry each a
tributary content night revealed which

140
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:20,430
is the same with a national the
attribute sorry we start the process

141
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:30,870
actually be able to talk to us the gene
which has 1332 is your memory

142
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,340
your free copy of this half of this re

143
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:43,459
hurry because of the implementation the
content of the parade i tributary will

144
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:51,290
not be clear we are not be that was
there we hope to control I national the

145
00:20:51,290 --> 00:21:00,680
a tributary with this raid a tributary

146
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:09,929
Auerbach and Poland both via a tributary
BRB allocate if we are lucky to be freed

147
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:19,460
memory is that too and so and actually
created by national we'll be a dream to

148
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:28,820
build it is also like the bad trade a
tributary to start to the naturalized

149
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:42,570
attribute we gotta read out the contact
of this gene that poor be free this tree

150
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:55,610
and look at the right time still object
yeah they are paper thin that great

151
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:04,189
stream now access to this fine actually
attributed to steal things this

152
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:12,550
attribute is the key attributes although
the g8 is already frayed be under real

153
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:26,220
but still I could be so read out the
natural at a tribute to gene actually be

154
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,360
live at the content of the rent house
the object the first appeared in the run

155
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:41,389
up to counter punch to the grandparents
grant on still a tributary

156
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:45,389
that's because the address on the screen

157
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:55,570
unleaded important israeli in part
because you can't side any attribute to

158
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:05,320
their object here we start more than
5,000 attributed to it after this the

159
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:15,349
third of runtime still a tributary is
there a lot and we allocate JavaScript

160
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:25,019
in hurry hurry will be located just off
the rent I'm still a tributary in

161
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:33,609
previous that we already left a track of
the rent and still a tributary so by

162
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:42,499
adding a third of that this literary be
back at the address of this in hurry

163
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:53,669
already information based on the pre

164
00:23:53,669 --> 00:24:03,320
we have a trap in hurry now so we can
make you can take the attribute value we

165
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:23,399
can make any kind of break actually a
little different this time we dream took

166
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:34,129
control of the unnatural the attribute
value for us a lot of course we've

167
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:40,469
controlled their freedom

168
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:47,690
and because I was employment history we
have talked about it before and prayed

169
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,260
and prayed but that date

170
00:24:51,260 --> 00:25:06,169
premier program the park and the morning
by a tributary BRB a lot allocate memory

171
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:12,830
of their free stream so the content of
the volleyball the attribute value will

172
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:22,189
be controlled by the wind it up at this
time we started there bTW pappu media

173
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:28,419
Virant and the value of you want into
the lake

174
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:39,690
JavaScript very big byron that our
control

175
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:46,299
grab their re become modified the polly
control of this week

176
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:58,918
think they did drugs that hold the virus
type of dates so you can see some

177
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,500
interesting encounter

178
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:12,280
counter take care of you and your
partner at our target

179
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:19,750
we start that type of the fake variant
to you you know her top and that

180
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:31,620
valuable to our crap they are about to
rate we attribute out in JavaScript it

181
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:39,919
actually we are ready for battle from
the pointed out to us we carried a btree

182
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,420
memory now you can see here our
self-defense publisher and the PAC audio

183
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:55,930
quality attribute to reach out and the
car polisher path to change the train to

184
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:10,480
stop because we are approaching us 64
paid intern at the employer attract 488

185
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:20,220
his last year you can see the address
below and we can chill between iraq the

186
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:32,210
GOP to treat though the ability to read
between I'm not we want to achieve

187
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:43,790
arbitrary track to continue our export
uranium we can crap last load of crap

188
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:51,409
the entry to achieve true but our
product is a little different in

189
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:58,420
previous tap the already proven that
make up the Union the punter attribute

190
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,150
so why not just make up fake

191
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:13,070
interoperability directly to make fake
of errant that can tell our crap entry

192
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,049
just like that

193
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:29,999
expect our crap sorry we need to a third
variant up to me today patch so this

194
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:37,960
time the value of food would be optic
counter wheel at all her party into

195
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:51,039
slavery to fully control the update not
recreate up no more jealous crap

196
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:59,090
hurry and get all content from this
normal crap a real update to our think

197
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:07,809
our crap interrupted after the coffee
hour break into a real objective has to

198
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:16,389
stay in contact with a big step that
this that the last of this take every

199
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:27,399
opportunity to a large stands here the
last few days by relax so you would like

200
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:36,649
that every week and the rate of change
memory

201
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:44,110
people including our shell cold we need
to bypass the FDA and a party and ET

202
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:50,959
actually this is not a big problem if
you have the ability to read and write

203
00:29:50,960 --> 00:30:04,380
opportunity every possible way to bypass
the atty the storm out our fav but some

204
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:12,770
of them are not until today you can use
military are real

205
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:23,090
Chennai Rico fun fun the address of the
pick you up and you can ride over dried

206
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:31,820
the return address of function after all
that when the return the coat plus they

207
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,189
are tapping into your coat and CMT
cheaper we are not taking this value

208
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:54,070
another example Culver API API in the
VIP list and what's more 08

209
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:02,860
billete to indirectly or directly to
change the value for example and he

210
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:16,399
continued long time so you think you can
buy pathology ok

211
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:26,110
bypass the european unity we are able to
choose between members of double check

212
00:31:26,110 --> 00:32:18,340
out now but you can see the older
contender I love you have a demo here

213
00:32:18,340 --> 00:33:36,830
here so trust case to Piper city parks

214
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:48,549
enhance the protected mode is introduced
the IU livin in Windows 8.0 on and it to

215
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:59,049
use the APB contender to further
restrict to the right and the pope's the

216
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:06,110
processes it to restrict their access to
system result it's basically the

217
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:14,049
processes running on the apt 1002 that
says to this result his voice out for

218
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:29,020
ice and the parks plus a few men has no
rights to access at low temp folder so

219
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:39,989
we are artists EV to solve them to 15
and 17 photos sorry this is COO CTO you

220
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:46,168
by GO sometimes known as day Chris
condition but it is that all you stand

221
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:55,940
out from memory corruption bug this bug
is the install pro pro so this so let's

222
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:06,980
introduce the broker service in osage as
we introduce a contender process have

223
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,609
very limited access to system resources
but sometimes these

224
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:22,299
need to access certain result is to
provide to their normal functionality ie

225
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:29,589
may need to to you start proc beings and
applause effects are being they need to

226
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:35,660
access the flash owner to access their
cash that her that's

227
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:44,609
this so there are some processing
assistant ronnie and media and the press

228
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:52,369
asks provide the functionality to the
apt contender processes to help are they

229
00:35:52,369 --> 00:36:02,420
to help them to access system resources
and why are you so y noticias foro so

230
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:14,390
that it is used by internet explorer to
install adults process which provided

231
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:21,098
the scene her phrase car I install don't
yet see and it is Ronnie needed to be

232
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:27,460
creepy have you seen her face is
successful for all we are seeing an apt

233
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:33,589
contender process which means if we
achieve the remote code execution

234
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:40,808
AP become tender process we can just
write code to access this interface and

235
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:47,640
we can use this interface to you by
means basically to use these see her

236
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,680
phrase to use store and

237
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,410
executable fire we need the three steps
there in five fire install fire

238
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:05,129
registered yet see fire we r us achieve

239
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:14,280
acquire a purpose to these broke her and
though he just called these if either of

240
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:22,059
these functions fares the installation
will be avail so let's have a look at

241
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:31,200
what exactly these three steps to first
first step is to call to verify this is

242
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:39,339
the most important step for all the
perspective of security its website to

243
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:45,230
verify that's where the fire is still
trying to his star has many the

244
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:54,839
signature you if I must have been a
decision made sure fire step and it also

245
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:01,308
checks that the fire crews are trying to
install use for a photo that's which is

246
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:08,270
not loading complete a level you at
least have this fire under the media and

247
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,340
people treat each other

248
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,220
either as you do it also and the
sickness tap Cody install fire it is

249
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:22,700
just seen Chloe think they call be the
prior to our destination folder where

250
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:29,870
you want to install these latter under
this gap which is also important it or

251
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:40,350
just call it across asked to execute the
five you want to install it seems ok

252
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:47,110
course this interface allows us to try
to get it but verify that the fire 12 in

253
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:54,740
star has that it has an interest but if
we review the US risked apps again you

254
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:00,370
may find that there is a risk condition
problem here which you can see this in

255
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,569
turn means that one under Step sorry
because this fire you specify the

256
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,490
Young's step 1 and executed

257
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:17,759
step sorry but if our excuse cease-fire
in step 3 it does not verify this fire

258
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,500
again which means if you are able to
replace the supplier and touring the

259
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:33,500
step on the steps free dental broker
we're not to know that stiff are you not

260
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:40,620
see the one that's verified that means a
first step and this is about to explode

261
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:46,319
this market is very stressful or first
week all better if I far too that if I

262
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,910
value the fire which has said it is
sitting in chair for a gesture verify

263
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:59,000
the internet peace for all projects
terrible and of course these this that

264
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:08,370
can be parsed the course that it is
second nature from Mike so-so and second

265
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:15,790
I call you still fire and the executable
them to our destination folder

266
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:22,800
here is the most important step before
we call this the staff we just need to

267
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:30,090
use the Internet Explorer fire and they
replaced it with our own executable I

268
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:37,320
think we test to replace her I'll
explore I thought you see here is a week

269
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:47,920
or the service staff registered text you
see fire and that this fire where are

270
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,370
all up lol be executed by the broker
service which means our people that can

271
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:01,620
go wrong the media into kuwaiti labor
and we i process the in-house to protect

272
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,319
him or the sandbox here's another
problem here

273
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,870
harder to use the six-party process so
we need to be able to replace the fire

274
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:21,640
it's a means to me must have write
access to the destination folder so we

275
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:30,690
must find a folder which we can write
the apt contender process and basically

276
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:37,270
this is destined not to many voters
things apt contenders has very limited

277
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,980
access to system photos

278
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:51,790
so here another broker service here for
that which is / broker broker you season

279
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:59,779
54 thats carvings and eight-probe I did
some interfaces to the last thing to

280
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:08,090
read it right this time photos you can
use a broker to read and write some

281
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:16,710
predefined locations in this issue
that's as the salon appt later domain

282
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:23,420
Adobe for that though he pulled her onto
the User folder and then you can use the

283
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,420
promo code for writing to this photo
which is important to this folder is is

284
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:36,420
not loading decreed he's so it is
exactly that when we want to find

285
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:45,619
another hotel property areas that's
broker tried to try to prevent you from

286
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:54,859
writing the bangers fire excludable
fires to Florida so there is a light at

287
00:42:54,859 --> 00:43:03,200
least that if I extension step to try to
use this broker and exe file you sent to

288
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:12,000
you so I police but that's not a problem
because great process API or just

289
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:21,450
checking the actual fire type so damn
you all fire as thoughts TPG and the

290
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:30,379
call pretty creative process I it's in
to cast year executed at a bad so so

291
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,770
this is Steve just to use it

292
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:44,480
ok there's lots to defy sliding past
broker to try to prevent you from

293
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:53,000
writing PU fires to the folder it's
called a broker broker rights fire to

294
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,600
write that they tied to the fire there
are tried to check that's where the

295
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:03,250
right team up he fire by by searching
the second nature to worry about part of

296
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:10,380
the dogs head and there's a p/e had here
for me if it finds its signature for

297
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,800
consider that I'm trying to write a
tender aspire and the rights will be

298
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:26,520
failed but check is not is not very
useful to you see it only checks the

299
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,509
first time that you are trying to write
to the fire so we can't guess bypass

300
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,130
this chick like this

301
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:38,360
first the way you write snappy right to
the fired a tony is on the second nature

302
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:47,370
with Jess location and then we can call
another function called the brokers 5.0

303
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,660
which is which is the same as this that
fire pulling her punches with no safety

304
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:58,490
I so we can set it afire points back to
the beginning of the fire and this time

305
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,549
we just right

306
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:12,610
also had just arrived to the two bites
that we have completed 15 passes it's so

307
00:45:12,610 --> 00:46:30,810
we had another demo here

308
00:46:30,810 --> 00:47:21,759
extra fires here and install fire to
install the lights broderick's the ball

309
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:34,090
thrust and they say my name that thought
best thought and actually it is Internet

310
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:45,960
Explorer executable and they test about
it and Microsoft signature which are

311
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,820
priced to sell for us

312
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,960
check

313
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:03,089
and then we were over I'd say sex to
1200 payload and they see a purely

314
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:11,810
override cease-fire becomes small and
actually it is a payload executable and

315
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:24,560
then we just called the snap and you can
see our exit employees executed in stock

316
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:36,420
broker service and

317
00:48:36,420 --> 00:49:07,660
which means we have bypassed the DPM
internet fraud and that's

318
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:49,160
and this is a key point all of our our
talk today and we introduce some

319
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:59,140
technique coast to exploit the latest
Internet Explorer 7 64 bit and we

320
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:05,549
introduce some message to exploit
initialize the memory bugs and we also

321
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:15,799
introduces how to buy percy EPM sandbox
off Internet Explorer ok that's for our

322
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:22,029
talk today thank you for coming and if
you have any questions we will be glad

323
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:23,079
to answer

324
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:23,729
thank you
