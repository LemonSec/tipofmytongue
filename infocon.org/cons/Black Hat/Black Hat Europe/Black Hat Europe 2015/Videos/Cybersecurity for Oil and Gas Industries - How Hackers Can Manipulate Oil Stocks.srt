1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,509
hi nice to meet you here I can probably
start the first presentation here and

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,710
bycatch

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:23,289
who will I my name is Alex what I'm
doing basically researching recipe in

4
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:29,320
Oracle Applications they found hundreds
of vulnerabilities in those applications

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:38,610
and so on my colleague made you he will
help me to present you this topic more

6
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,540
details

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,769
yeah what we doing many things in Oracle
but this presentation will be kind of

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:56,739
mixed up what we usually do with what we
do on the user's so this topic for me

9
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:04,268
it's very it's it's very new type of
research is it's very unusual and how it

10
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:11,990
was started basically when I was just a
young penetration tester is about 27 and

11
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,439
six almost ten years ago I was more than
one of them

12
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:23,939
assessments of natural gas company and
they have they had a retail store was

13
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,449
poised point of sales training else was
a petrol station and they wanted us to

14
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,560
analyze accuse you of the software and
hardware in this special edition but it

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,850
was not a simple been tasked like you
know to find vulnerabilities and get

16
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,990
access to operation system they they
were they were asking like what the

17
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:56,439
attackers can really do with this axis
and they they question was because some

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,898
cybercriminals successfully exploited
their system they put it the mail we're

19
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:08,889
on the software in Hardwar and they were
able to steal from the stations would be

20
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,200
harder so it was a real attack and we
were enrolled in

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,470
forensic investigation and we tried to
analyze the vulnerable to see what it

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,650
was many years ago but after that I
realize that I want to spend my research

23
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,050
not like it not only on the technical
staff how to find a vulnerability but

24
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:38,970
also how to show their management their
real risk and what can happen and then

25
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,750
you know you're going to last year's who
were engaged in large that stopped the

26
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:56,060
oil and gas companies with SCP
vulnerability assessment but the

27
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,810
question their questions were ok we you
have access to SCP but now what's what

28
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,989
you can do and I was really thinking you
know what I can do is well I guess

29
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:16,910
company because most of the men test
usually against banking sector and is it

30
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,590
is say yeah we can you know have access
to instill money and that's easy but

31
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,370
what you can do with oil and gas company
that was a question and that without was

32
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:38,109
trying to understand so let's start with
oil gas basics there are three types of

33
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:44,930
practices they processing oil and gas
upstream midstream and downstream and

34
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,370
different companies there are some
companies who can who managed the

35
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,100
upstream midstream and downstream there
are some companies through walls only

36
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,510
manage the one part 2 upstream companies
that the companies who take some from

37
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:06,340
the ground and you know trust you read
stories that's it it's it's much more

38
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,880
complex but simply dummy treatments like
some companies you know

39
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,049
oil from one place to

40
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:22,540
place and downstream is basically
refining petrochemicals and wholesale

41
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,690
retail and so on so it looks like that
again we have upstream it's mostly about

42
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,860
the exploration of oil like to find a
place where we can do real 22 basically

43
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:44,310
to drill to take the oil and do some
basic things like separation of guesses

44
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,020
then we have a midstream as a storage
and processing and the downstream so

45
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:01,549
let's look at the details of each of
those those pants upstream we have those

46
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,210
prices are set to resolve their main
process of course we have some more so

47
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,739
extraction is everything that is related
to find some place for dreaming and

48
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,690
explored ready then we have gathering is
like taking oil from the crowds to the

49
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,800
separators and in separate us of course
because we take some some stuff is not a

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,500
royal basically oil + Gas + water + and
then a lot of things so we need to

51
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,530
somehow separated we had separated and
in each of those parts we there are some

52
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:47,250
small part of like in separate there are
different types of separators was no

53
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:55,140
different types of pressure their heater
burner since stuff like that so each of

54
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:03,610
those big prizes like there are some
small critical processes so we have here

55
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,050
then then for guests we have compression
for all we have some kind of temporary

56
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,990
storage and of course we have knee
during this critical parts so we need to

57
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:25,970
measure the quality of oil some how can
it not very good but it's just a

58
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,470
graphical presentation how how those
processes are going so we have

59
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:39,160
extraction from the whales and oil going
to the separate terrorist and then to

60
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,030
the storage so so the next step in the
midstream in mid-stream we have things

61
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,570
like

62
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:57,729
management so determined to somehow
transfer or oil transport oil or gas

63
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:04,890
stored this in the different facilities
and manage the storage and it all looks

64
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:13,050
like that and again you know lots of
different places like terminals

65
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:23,550
terminals for four barges for trucks and
for different parts many many things and

66
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:38,610
and last part is the downstream refining
is basically where we need to create the

67
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:46,190
petrol from oil and we have different
petrochemicals it's it's a whole new

68
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:53,330
universe like it so many different types
of hardware and software potential

69
00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:00,669
vulnerabilities to i think thats can be
friends with talks only about but

70
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,919
different attacks in different types of
oil gas petrochemicals so it's really

71
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:12,530
these areas really so big so I might
talk is just you know all of you it's

72
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:20,049
not possible to give you a detailed
information of all the things but it's

73
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,009
like some

74
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:29,339
there's some kind of over you and the
things what can happen is it's here so

75
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:42,409
they also the main reason it's mostly
about their plans sabotage us about the

76
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,380
damage for equipment then search for
utility is this

77
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,439
things like changing their product
quality like if you have access to

78
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:02,019
refinery can change some parameters and
will be not so good as you wanted to be

79
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:07,740
and so on and in the transportation

80
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:15,209
things like illegal tapping its a really
big problem in the midstream process

81
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:22,529
because somebody can you know

82
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:32,050
illegal tapping in the oil wells and
just steal oil and many examples if you

83
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,979
just google for illegal pipeline you
will find so many examples of how people

84
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,069
oil and of course some cum blasted
relations and so on so those are the

85
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:53,279
things which can happen if somebody can
exploit the system but how it's how it's

86
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:02,839
possible it's so let's look at the some
of the most critical practices choose

87
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,480
only three processes for the first one
is the separation separation consists

88
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,959
basically different things like burning
management systems compression control

89
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:25,619
systems and other stuff and there are
some in for each of those processes to

90
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:34,110
pick software and hardware applications
so when people talk about I C

91
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,149
s security of the people not to talk
about SCADA systems but if but when I

92
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:45,820
just started researching guess I
understood the sky it's it's like a 1%

93
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:56,149
of things that really exists in process
there are so many systems ICS systems

94
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:03,380
which control specific plz devices in
specific meters so management assistance

95
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:11,420
it's there are so many companies would
develop different types of learning

96
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,170
management systems in each of them can
have specific vulnerabilities and

97
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,189
several types of the configuration
issues and so on

98
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:29,110
yeah and the burn measurement systems
are no I think the most interesting

99
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:38,269
because they exist in many processes
Peterson separators and so on so there

100
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:48,079
are different companies who develop it
more mostly Honeywell Schneider Electric

101
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:59,130
allen-bradley anderson also for vendors
who really have software and hardware

102
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:09,939
for most of the oil and gas assistance
so there are some types of flame sensors

103
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,690
then we have some different PLC devices
which monitor the flames and says and

104
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,209
then there are some management system
which basically manage all the process

105
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:27,109
management process so than in management
systems designed to protect the

106
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,570
interests from explosion and if there is
a system which is designed to protect

107
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:40,100
from explosion we can get access to the
system we can do something that

108
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,980
and yeah

109
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:56,829
example of where a simple and management
system consists of the things like gas

110
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:06,529
supply oil supply air fares are there
are some walks like safety of all that

111
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:15,889
to say that you will we have flame
sensor and other things its example from

112
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:23,120
the simple Siemens burner management
system for example if we have access to

113
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,019
burn that matters in a system that
question is what we can do because you

114
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:34,959
know many presentations like ok we have
access to be able to do what we can do

115
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,599
something that was critical process but
what what exactly and you can read the

116
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,470
presentation from just a lot of sand
it's very good research about really

117
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,100
about this till like what we can do with
access to critical system but what about

118
00:13:51,100 --> 00:14:01,389
learning management system so they are
three components in fire triangle we

119
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:13,550
have oxygen through it and if something
will happen with was air filtration it's

120
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:21,790
not it's not okay but if rule is missing
everything is fine but if air is missing

121
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:28,170
it's it's potentially dangerous because
if air is missing we there some rule

122
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,209
which can be left in

123
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:39,638
in the combustion chamber and then the
next time that some some proves that the

124
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,740
next time you will start the burning
process there will be an explosion so

125
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:53,209
the the idea is that accurate wants to
make some bad things to the burner

126
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,989
management critical process need to
control the sources of flammable

127
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:09,269
mixtures in there there are four things
what can happen so for example oil or

128
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:15,569
gas leaking to combustion chamber
because the walls were not properly

129
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:22,670
closed so some guests can the to the
combustion chamber or for example some

130
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:29,279
oil and next time next time when you
burn the system be there was when you

131
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,809
start the system will be a potential
explosion and the other thing is like if

132
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:46,029
you don't do the bridge after every
system reboot when you shut down the

133
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:53,350
system some parts of oil can or guests
can left in the combustion chamber and

134
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:02,350
you need to do some porridge to clean
the clean up things and if you don't do

135
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,290
that so the next time you have some some
small amount of oil in the chamber than

136
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,439
a little bit more and more and more and
then when you have a fire oil oil will

137
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:22,829
explode and this is how both go to you
conduct some kind of attack there are

138
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:30,628
other things like for example if you if
the heat is not enough there will be no

139
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:39,540
fire but oil walter is open so oil
bastille store in

140
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:50,959
to so many different physical attacks so
and learning management system they

141
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:58,319
basically control over those risks so
the question is what you can do with

142
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,829
domain management system if you have
access to the system is a thing as too

143
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:12,659
because if you don't turn of the open
time warp sort of the ignition there are

144
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,760
some other parts or other sensors we can
we can alert but if you turn now

145
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,879
purge so once I need to reboot the
system everything is ok and next time it

146
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,770
was ok but after the by 4:10

147
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:43,740
explosion so it's like like deals
physical backdoor attack so it was you

148
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:51,340
know one deep dive into one of the
process in order to get the other

149
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:59,590
critical part is maturing and one of the
most critical + of metering is

150
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:10,070
committing or custody transfer because
when for example upstream company sales

151
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:15,470
oil to the midstream company they need
to measure this oil

152
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:22,700
the quantity of oil it's not like
setting New Balance boots you know how

153
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,909
much would you happen you know how to
you know it's it's easy to sell you have

154
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:37,790
a thousand books and books but in oil
guess he needs to have major very very

155
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:46,080
good squad it's easy to do that and

156
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:55,649
yeah and those those things are called
it discriminatory because if you have a

157
00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:07,678
small error in the measurement like less
than 1% of person the company the

158
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,409
typical company can raise millions of
dollars and that's why the specific

159
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:25,399
systems to control his commentary so
basically a very expansive and

160
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:34,059
flowmeters from those vendors and then
there are flow computers computers for

161
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:40,210
example that Daniel Dennett back now
it's called Emerson for both it's one of

162
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:47,090
the most popular computers for fiscal
metering so it's it's a it's a big

163
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,668
computer

164
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:56,399
the idea of this computer just 2008
quality quantity of oil based on

165
00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:03,330
different parameters like pressure
temperature and stuff like that those

166
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:09,249
computers I think that security of those
computer system mostly through obscurity

167
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:18,100
because nobody real access to those
devices but if if if we have if somebody

168
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,139
can have access device are pretty sure
that it's it's vulnerable but the idea

169
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:29,658
is not here that ideas like ok we have
this floor computer but the data from

170
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:35,700
these slow computer to send it to some
accounting system which is controlled by

171
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:44,609
a CPA or or stuff like this so we can
change these days somewhere in a in a

172
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:52,249
debt obligation system so and the South
Sound assistance which mentioned here

173
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:57,509
have internet access is some of them
have access to for example business

174
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:04,820
applications like a super system so
they're not they're not just inside some

175
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,928
operations technology network they have
real connections to the outside world

176
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:18,519
and they lost the critical brought us
this oil storage it's also consists of

177
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,690
different ones like majors then we have
10 gouging systems and then we have

178
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,629
tanked in Ventura system is different
thanks we have we need to collect this

179
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:35,779
information from from tanks and then we
have terminal management systems which

180
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:42,179
control tower convention resistance and
Bill systems connected with business

181
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:49,169
applications like I said be so this is
briefly how it looks like they have

182
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:56,230
different tanks and how things are going
so for example here we can see that

183
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,950
there are tanks must have server and
this terrorist any information

184
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:08,490
and then this information by using
obviously cleanse going to stop

185
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,350
somewhere else and some of the tank
inventor assistance not only allows it

186
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:24,320
to view information but the allows you
to control like change the alarm levels

187
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,740
and so on and to finalize the part of
the physical part is the question is how

188
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:38,230
attackers can get access to understand
what the systems implemented in the

189
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:44,250
particular company that's that's where
it easy you can just open their website

190
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,620
of any company like honeywell and look
at the press releases like we

191
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:55,010
implemented these xxx system to that
company and is still many formation on

192
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,940
the Lincoln CNN success stories and
stuff like that let's talk about their

193
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:07,970
enterprise applications because the idea
of this talk case to show how the

194
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,470
operations of critical operations
technology processes are connected with

195
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:21,570
enterprise business applications and we
have most the recipient or installed in

196
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:28,439
86% of the world as fortunate as
companies but this is more important

197
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:36,639
thing now seventy million barrels of oil
per day is controlled by ACP assistance

198
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:40,199
and you know how much will produce per
day

199
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,679
294 me too so it's 75 percent of all oil
production controlled by a city

200
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:57,510
assistance think it's kind of a critical
part and SCP systems they have many

201
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:05,139
business applications to manage guess
they have great presentation that what

202
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:12,549
kind of areas they control and I need to
do a presentation more quickly

203
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,119
quicker about

204
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,718
so many slides in you can find white
paper and presentation so I'll just stop

205
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:26,089
on the most critical things so sore
price which are managed by Seb basically

206
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,839
the capital spending the 15 this is not
very interesting this but it's

207
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,399
interesting as you know global supply
chain so some sob systems like a CPSC

208
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:47,899
oil and SCP X MIII which designed to
manage production and revenue and so on

209
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:52,049
and there's a digital

210
00:24:52,049 --> 00:25:00,149
oil operations consist of two different
systems listed here they're also

211
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:09,488
involved in like majoring storage and so
on and operational integrity its asset

212
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:20,149
management systems they collect
information about different assets so so

213
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:24,918
they need to have some connections
operations knowledge network Oracle also

214
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:38,199
have many things in operation so this is
one of the main slides how business

215
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:46,429
applications are connected with
operation technology areas so we have to

216
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:50,859
project management systems we should
connected to exploration systems we have

217
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:55,438
asset lifecycle management which
connected to refinery and separation

218
00:25:55,439 --> 00:26:03,399
because you to control that they would
have limbs systems and different master

219
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:10,508
systems like I see people getting a CPA
exam I and this plot for the top-down

220
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:12,059
management will be there

221
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:21,408
our demonstration basically so how how
we can manage the oil storage based on

222
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:32,759
the recipe assistance so we're very
simple system the company is the

223
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:39,189
structure look like that so how
different SMP systems connected with his

224
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:46,459
outside cloth and how they connect its
operations technology and it's very

225
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:54,289
simple example and you can imagine how
you know how how complex it can be so

226
00:26:54,289 --> 00:27:02,699
different ways how attackers can get
access to operation to knowledge network

227
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:10,309
from enterprise network so if people
think that there is an air gap between

228
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:11,649
operations

229
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:18,508
enterprise now it's not and there are so
many ways in our deal this presentations

230
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:25,889
to show you what kind of what kind of
waste we have so we can do something

231
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:30,549
that lets the first of all we need to
get access from the internet to

232
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:37,239
enterprise network this is the least of
presentations my old presentations about

233
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:43,699
different vulnerabilities in ASAP
Internet resources like a supporter how

234
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:49,569
to hack SCP router is also facing
applications how to exploit the Droid

235
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:54,969
and so all the things how so many things
out how we can exploit a safety systems

236
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:56,739
to get inside the company

237
00:27:56,739 --> 00:28:03,139
ok when you're inside you can exploit
different earpieces cute issues like

238
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:09,369
validated miss configurations casting
court issues so I don't want to waste

239
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:16,099
any time on this area just will tell you
that sleepy applications have 3500

240
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:22,629
vulnerabilities telephony and every
mouth this EP release passions forward

241
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:31,319
to any 230 new vulnerabilities it's
pretty much so it's not a problem to

242
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,850
understand how you get access to the
system four or more or less

243
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:44,270
same considerations so I City systems to
so complex hundreds of different

244
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:52,418
services applications and so on that can
be used to exploit the system and custom

245
00:28:52,419 --> 00:29:01,799
court issues gained the system's the
business applications are customizable

246
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:08,460
and every company can develop they or
transactions and especially in the

247
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,740
Pacific industries they can develop
their own transactions programs to

248
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,020
manage production and storage and
metering cancel one and those programs

249
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,850
can have a positive but it is so if you
are interested in ASAP security and just

250
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:34,418
open ear piece cannot comment is fifty
presentations of this area but and yeah

251
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:40,090
I think that now it's now was started as
a technical probs how we can get access

252
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:48,449
to this application like UPS systems
operations network will start here

253
00:29:48,450 --> 00:30:03,340
different program risk ensure process
for oil and gas extraction and

254
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,240
splenocytes

255
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:16,820
CPLP system connected to will see a
focus on some concrete examples and we

256
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:23,789
found and how we can get down from the
high level support business suits to the

257
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,040
plants

258
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:38,889
the industry we have a lot of varieties
for the sub business suits its like

259
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:45,520
hypotheses we already own some yerba
system at this level and we see that

260
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:53,010
there is a connection with sub in my
eyes it's like we talked a little with

261
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,700
major component of stuff that is
bridging the plants and the business

262
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:07,710
world and after some sublime
connectivity and Hannah and that we will

263
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:16,810
we focus on those kind of those systems
and the neurons so you can see that

264
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:23,690
there are several factors attack vectors
to get from the top to the bottom so we

265
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:33,480
don't shy one interesting victories from
PCO and don't want

266
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:43,730
and under victor will be from 22 to get
to the TCO and then so what we need to

267
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:52,790
hockey it's no I missed as well iraq
it's big but anyway we need to have to

268
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,760
hard rock subhana

269
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:10,910
at Paseo and then we get we get to the
plants so so irregular Enterprise Asset

270
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:17,040
Management's do you have a kind of
businesses should + from thats has

271
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:30,200
already known vulnerabilities so we we
discussed 09 which is like excess

272
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,040
juilliard

273
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:45,559
user and there i read is so you have the
link for that so no we will focus on not

274
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:51,860
it's what data base in memory it's

275
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:59,760
the connection in the projects or
royalty on you

276
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,950
there is a connection between subjects
you something like that so it's a

277
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,760
contribution we can get access if we own
our two submissive and then the plants

278
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:22,020
at actual face of is we have a serial
connection between different system

279
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:32,040
there is a sub assy connections and of
course in a run so we just two months

280
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:40,090
ago in September released we found a
memory corruption that gets to a remote

281
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:49,820
code execution in the HEB index several
days so it's very kind of gets a very

282
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:57,340
high CVSS score and it's bad and that
get us to to the full control of this

283
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:05,679
kind of service of course such as
special invitees then you can decide not

284
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:13,860
and you will find everything to get
things fixed that's good to know another

285
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:25,389
factor was doctor gets to you and then
the so it's so what is it because there

286
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:32,340
there's a lot of acronyms if you're not
serious in this world it's a nightmare

287
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,149
when the Sun always so nice
manufacturing integration and

288
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:43,319
intelligence so the bridge between
manufacturing and enterprise business

289
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:52,990
gets you know friends stands prediction
performance to people that are less

290
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,098
technical so

291
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,039
it's it's own subnet you are genes you
do too

292
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:11,589
platform with its beaches it's a big big
platform with a lot of stuffs Mr will

293
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:20,880
you will have for instance no its
previous technologies SAP technology

294
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:30,619
that's exposed web services and can use
data from multiple systems there is a

295
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:43,710
big exposure this think this component
is on the corporate network it's not on

296
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:53,039
the other side it's not on the OT the
main application is now accepting years

297
00:35:53,039 --> 00:36:03,779
it's interesting is the kind of issue
issue want to get access to the MRI

298
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:07,779
stuff in the server will point your
browser to this you are it's the

299
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:15,109
beginning of fantastic so

300
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:22,239
some meat is actually another is Brian
just realized that get us to the world

301
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:31,569
of the instance but we can't discuss the
details it does not be sixty years and

302
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:40,299
six so we can suppose not its on mir who
is dis generality we have admin access

303
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:53,329
on the net you a platform what's okay so
that's the actual face we focus on the

304
00:36:53,329 --> 00:37:05,559
on the funeral which is the natural so
what can we do have access we would like

305
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,740
it will be

306
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:16,310
very useful execution access so we we
find something very interesting analysis

307
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:23,549
of the platform there is a future of
that season in the log viewer the

308
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:31,350
platform that enables you to connect to
remote system so I was interest you know

309
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:40,880
what's what's the future so we can set
an IP and hard coded protocol subway

310
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,640
subs

311
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:55,540
Agencia so I put my own IP under my
control I open my laptop and I see

312
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:05,990
what's what I gets so many will send us
some progress to my my laptop he will

313
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:12,750
send me nicely authorization by the
heater and if I did this I see restraint

314
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:23,960
username quite long looking like a UID
and passwords that's quite so what can I

315
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,790
do is this information super interesting
but I don't really know yet so with some

316
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,270
research to understand that the parts it
was connected to the different parties

317
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:45,820
try to connect to 513 its own party's
observer to get control its it exposes

318
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,840
solvency deficit on all the service and
lets you control like a process instance

319
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,660
start stop that kind of control over our
control of both the instance so it's

320
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,808
like this kind of connection should be
used

321
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:10,459
trusted setup server inside the
restaurant and have suppressed and this

322
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:17,410
this winter freeze exposes silver medals
and one min so that was very interesting

323
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:25,739
was the six accused me of course it gets
gets my interest in so they think is

324
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:32,779
execuse need to be authenticated usually
this server you need to have the OS

325
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:39,689
username and password to get through the
authentication subsurface in this case

326
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:46,069
this strange username and passwords gets
you as well you don't need to know the

327
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:51,900
username and password thats runs the top
seven so you can you can get execution

328
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:59,059
with distractions on a man on the server
it will be executed by the user or user

329
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:06,239
that's running the September it's it's
not root of course but it's it's the sub

330
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:16,249
user that is running the RDM in the
change of so that's kind of stuff we can

331
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:21,999
quickly damage or because I can run the
shell shell comment so I will open my

332
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:31,689
bucket or run its get a remote shell and
that's the beginning for another step to

333
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:38,460
200 PC or so just a little comments
about

334
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:46,490
when I have access to any server I can
get some information like passwords they

335
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:54,430
are treated with some but in the final
same directory you will find the G two

336
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:02,700
the encrypted file so with that which
you can decrypt the Sybase database

337
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:11,520
administrator and several substances so
it's always good but our interest to get

338
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:27,400
down to the plan so we want insurance
not so its hostages on the network and

339
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:37,200
what it is so its subprime connectivity
it's the bridge between manufacturing

340
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:48,069
model of South it's not only am i but we
aren't resting on my Windows box score

341
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:57,490
did not met its obligation ok so and
it's used the logic of usual pipeline

342
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:04,149
you have sources sources this nation and
you will have some you will get

343
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:15,589
information so it's kind of proxy from
information from the transparency and

344
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:26,029
those resources are basically like much
freakin who I could see the most used

345
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:33,520
since my cheek and keeps ever X or you
cannot directly this year system as well

346
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:45,119
defined as sources but we will look at
the source and destination like we said

347
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,990
Xie

348
00:42:47,990 --> 00:43:00,229
when you have which is connected to this
nation where you have several instances

349
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:08,020
they are technically Windows services so
process running as a service and they do

350
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,089
the the bowling in the words of the
information between no social

351
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:26,040
destination ok so no serious like of
course natural beauties of PCOS but you

352
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:35,630
have actually connection between any and
some consideration when you are sitting

353
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:42,410
your PC or server as a very much you
will have several listening on PC or an

354
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:49,310
MBE sending a request on the other side
you could not station mud and in this

355
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:56,470
case that will be PC or that will send
us information about the process so we

356
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,620
were interested by the remote

357
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:06,160
of PCO because then there's several
listening on PC or and we have I so it's

358
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:15,970
like a good use case so so the thing is
we are in this country on the pro

359
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:25,740
process i think is

360
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,149
day when you configure when you add a
new that are several inside Mr idea ask

361
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:42,530
you have the choice is to get access to
the US Open jeffrey's of PCO to get

362
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:55,040
control over the engine start-stop the
thing is this station its the Windows

363
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:06,230
users so it started with we found a
story inside the base in table and but

364
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:14,590
the thing is it's having a look at
what's going on its store insiders

365
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:23,380
service that's secure storage inside and
and this is quite well designed you

366
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:29,780
cannot so easily gets to the trip in
this key if you're not see any

367
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:36,609
obligation but the thing is we notice
does inside them you can have a control

368
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:43,100
encryption used inside the third base
for the credentials and we saw that ok

369
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,230
apparently based 64

370
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:55,540
authorized like encryption so it's
cooler and then we get we have access to

371
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:02,020
the data bases and maybe we can get
based 64 password and the cordage and

372
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:08,430
get the Windows users of this has been
fixed

373
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:16,970
recently very quickly by sub this month
with this app not so the base 64 is not

374
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:17,970
anymore

375
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:28,500
roads as encryption metals and ok so the
kind of service that are interesting to

376
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:35,560
look at that are running in Dec or those
are so promote administration I really

377
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:42,680
thought about that running on the parts
and which gets you access to the

378
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,970
conservation of the Paseo and very good
because inside you can have depending on

379
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:53,980
the configuration of the PC or you can
find another type of the passwords and

380
00:46:53,980 --> 00:47:02,619
proceedings so it's very interesting and
there is an interesting point nine

381
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:08,160
thousands that's the part listening to
gets requests from the media server so

382
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:18,990
using XML protocol over a similar they
call it and of course the tissue box is

383
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:25,390
not properly sidewalls you will you will
have access to the 405 and with our

384
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:31,670
credentials it will be a piece of cake
to honor

385
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:39,270
ok so the kind of attacks that's our
interests you know it's like we can

386
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:47,799
build a PC and shield actual PCR and
shows Mr that's everything is going okay

387
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:58,980
so it's like does something else like
doing a month without say several that

388
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:04,440
transmits the data was a real PC or
server and just do some slight

389
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:14,049
modification represent so this means
like issue however much during

390
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:15,740
intercourse on the mir

391
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:22,229
I will show its later because maybe we
got some pictures to get it but you can

392
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:30,010
be monitoring interface on that will
show you your delivery option and that

393
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:37,329
kind of production information so we can
manipulate information and to show on

394
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:52,599
the operator that's why the tank is is
is going on on the 9000 ports server

395
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:59,089
product or attack we did some further
from some dogs memory exhaustion this

396
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:08,578
those problems they have been seeks to
just a week ago by myself so it's in

397
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:17,020
this not so this means that no we have
some control about what's going on on

398
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,559
the network

399
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:31,119
and that's that's a good point we get
down like we wanted so PCR is

400
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:41,059
interacting with us we we we found
intention at that people are still have

401
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:48,449
program with my contribution was that
she was dick and getting complicated and

402
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:55,319
on the sub help forum know someone
answer that's you know that's the issue

403
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:59,788
and are all on the same box it would be
much easier on you won't have any

404
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:16,539
problems so that kind of stuff she's
like difference it's cool no I can show

405
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:31,209
you a little demo is like so I was here
is just we have access to TCO during

406
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:36,439
sneezing some kind of polished than it
is in mind as you saw on the internet

407
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:49,420
people really implement the OPC server
on the same windows books as CEO and

408
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:57,039
office aerosol basically collect data
from the PLC ISS so if you had PC or

409
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:08,710
your inside the network you have direct
access to opposite devices and and

410
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:15,349
so the POC devices they control most of
the production and they used the bus

411
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:22,650
protocol so it's like just sending
simple package without any other

412
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:27,680
indications to control them so it
basically if you have a PC or your you

413
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,250
like inside the network and the only
thing you need to know it's like the

414
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:41,859
details so the the existing process and
yet our example is too so we have a

415
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:49,529
configuration you you will continue yeah
yeah so our demonstration is the full

416
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:56,599
process of you have to like at 10:10

417
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:19,240
as a proof of concept we sup and might i
20 and then we we have several is

418
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,919
getting information

419
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:33,030
S seven Siemens PLC in speaking with
Siemens product or easily what we show

420
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:41,800
that we can honor of what I mean by
sending

421
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:53,780
data so we have a place where we learn
information about the level of water in

422
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:05,180
our case in the office but we cannot
imagine how easy and then we say we get

423
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:11,120
control about the which is opening the
water tanks and with the information of

424
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:38,420
the liver you still steady like it was
so issue

425
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:56,210
so we have our neee supervision
dashboards that shows us the little of

426
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:05,470
the tanks that you see on the right side
in the Lebanon is quite full 20,000

427
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:14,740
gallons and I will will on the normal
operation we open maybe you don't see

428
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,740
the water is flowing and you see that
compete in the end I showed that the

429
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:31,328
ladies going down so I and the study's
goal is the red square ok thats so the

430
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:41,190
values opened up a closed and no have a
client's my own decisions on any server

431
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:47,480
looks like it's quite strong but for the
just demonstration for the president's

432
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:53,750
aides so my client is sending request to
get the oil level and I i SAT with

433
00:54:53,750 --> 00:55:04,710
several several that will spoof queries
to any E and will give him this or 11 I

434
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:16,040
have admin access to any change in the
constitution and it should be put on

435
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,589
host because I'm on the media server and
I would begin to receive friends from

436
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:28,150
the current process and as always we see
now that is our fax messages that are

437
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:34,359
displayed on the interface I will open
with Mike symbols like opened the water

438
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:38,520
was flowing down so now the water is

439
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:51,940
throwing down and kissed you still
doesn't move going ok I closed the

440
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:59,690
values I replace the real Sarah just to
see that ok what is the real over now

441
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:09,470
and you see that ok we just until the
time it shouldn't change that and gets

442
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:34,390
far but yeah that's that's the
demonstration of this kind of attack so

443
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:49,098
in the ten still the idea is to show
basically is your overall presentation

444
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:53,849
is to show that there are some
connections many different connections

445
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:58,839
from enterprise network operations knows
your network and an oil and gas there

446
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:08,089
are so many processes that you can
control by those so just to name a few

447
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:14,609
things what can happen because they the
name of the talk was how hikers can

448
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:22,680
control the oil stocks and you sell this
kind of the back door how we can tell

449
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,868
the decision-makers how much are we have
but in reality we will have much less

450
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:35,990
and if you know that their CPU control
the Senate 75% off oil production so if

451
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:42,439
you manage to build this every company
and just a little bit change the

452
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:53,220
quantity of while in stocks for every
company just a little bit so that's how

453
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:58,980
we can I guess really manipulate oil
starts because if companies think that

454
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:06,430
there's less oil that they have price
for oil will be higher and more sense

455
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:14,299
and other than other auto corrector
which is possible supply plant equipment

456
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:22,210
sabotage and even with old bomber
ability in equipment you have asset

457
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,890
management systems which

458
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:32,129
designed to control to tell you how many
how many problems in specific equipment

459
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:38,769
so you can send the report that there is
a problem in equipment is somewhere

460
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:45,078
remote facility in oil gas it will be
some offshore platform isn't in the

461
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:50,410
middle of nowhere so that's how you can
and you can say in the system that there

462
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:57,690
is a problem here so the company will
send people to the city to do something

463
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:01,960
but there is no problem so they will
spend mining time and so on and the

464
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,170
planned destruction basically can happen
for example was born in management

465
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:14,079
system how just you that protect
business applications and review all

466
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:20,240
connections and secure connections and
and don't include the critical

467
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:27,609
infrastructure PC or systems 22 domain
because sometimes we saw that they're

468
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:33,578
included into domain because there is
specific configurational consideration

469
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:42,509
need for that and they're clean demand
but it's not really required and so why

470
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:49,849
don't think what what what the hell it
was for researchers now you guys know

471
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:54,869
how what are the different business
processes and whether different systems

472
00:59:54,869 --> 01:00:01,890
in oil and gas it's a big landscape for
new research into a whole new universe

473
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:08,180
for pen tester is now you know when you
have been tests weren't gas company you

474
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:15,200
can try to get access 2002 network or
you can at least tell your company's not

475
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,519
just like I have access to alteration
system I have no you can say we have

476
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:26,390
access to these technology and we can do
these things in that and for security

477
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,900
office now you know that there are
connections between business-critical

478
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,460
applications in OT and will assist some
of them

479
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:44,390
you can now you know how to thanks for
listening this presentation hope you

480
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:44,819
enjoy it
