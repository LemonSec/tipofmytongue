1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
ok good afternoon folks thanks for
dropping by my talking about I'm in the

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,920
position in raids open source projects
and GBIC the right New Years 24 position

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,460
on time synchronization for mobile
devices however this time on the

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,470
petition date ha of mobile devices i
just didnt silver so the verified by

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,410
most windows and developers it provides
a huge attack surface for a petition you

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,289
just talk I will walk you through the
masses off position there on time

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:36,399
spoofing is simply resume open source
projects and my name is a wonk on

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,420
security and at least a forum or a
security team group in China just remind

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:52,340
me not coerce or so they just talk but
they are attending the W 1100 in China

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,469
so they can kind of say come here today

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,699
ok in this talk I will demonstrate the
time and positioned at home for mobile

12
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,439
devices can be easily treated using open
source tools and neither physical

13
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,679
attacks weeds and mobile devices no
jailbreak process it's an issue sorry

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,580
it's able to interfere all the position
I'm time are with cell phones in the

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,220
surrounding area several years ago it's
still very expensive for personal

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,970
potential attackers to obtain as Giardia
by says STR stands for software defined

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:39,310
radio SDR platforms are becoming much
cheaper cost of this message that is

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,840
only about 300 orders today and could be
even cheaper chips made her first I was

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,899
introduced to endemic method of GPS
signal sporting with STR platform I will

20
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:58,990
show our method of wi-fi based
positioning smoking in our opinion it's

21
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,908
urgent to you from windows and
developers of mobile devices

22
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,729
and GPS and wi-fi positioning date haha
not reliable and should be verified

23
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,760
carefully in the end I some advices on
pruitt of preventing such thing i prided

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:24,609
ok let's look at the GPS the smoking
first let us define the problem of GPS

25
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:31,879
positioning and varied set alight at
Saks why why why we won and we can

26
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,790
narrow the time it takes for you
signalled to reach from the set I to us

27
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,310
which she's tall what with the velocity
often like to see we have this equation

28
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,650
which says the distance from XYZ to
exelon like 10

29
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,200
equal to see times call what we cannot
just saw love this song so she said i

30
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,540
three unknowns so we can simply add
another to satirize who scored in aids

31
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,760
are already known to let's mark them as
extra light to add a tool and accessory

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,019
Weiss writes a story and also we
commemorate the durations tal tu untold

33
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,440
story so we can get on equations set and
showing you the lower right of this

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,510
lighter now it seems that our position
coordinate axes why they can be solved

35
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:32,250
out of the equations but it's not enough
during practice two maro taiwan we

36
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,160
compared the time of receiving
understanding of the signal the time

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,230
after receiving come from our local
clock while the time of sending come

38
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,929
from the clock on the satellite so to
Clark's are not necessarily synchronized

39
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,880
time deviation between them we noted as
the deputy 13 ski without a new set of

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,780
free quotation

41
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,860
again we cannot solve these equations
and see if we have just introduced us

42
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,310
three additional announced which is a
debt owed to you undoubtedly true

43
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,720
underdog story no way have a good news
on the bench the good news either

44
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,899
clogged how different the GPS satellites
high-precision atomic clocks which are

45
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,810
strictly a single night so all of these
keys are equal

46
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:37,990
now we have the following equation but
the bad news is we still cannot solve

47
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:47,240
this equation that we hope for and no
one's right and three croatian so the

48
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,919
answer is simple we just sat out the
fourth that's right

49
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:02,200
equations that becomes this now our
position XY they can be solved it out of

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,880
the equations that and this is right at
least 24 satellites are needed to

51
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,409
complete a GPS positioning part says
besides we can also calculate our local

52
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:21,030
clock offset against atomic clock in the
GPS satellites and just procedure are

53
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:29,830
you know as GPS time synchronization ok
let's have a quick glance at GPS

54
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:39,250
satellite signal friends basically GBIC
the BPSK signal unca code broadcasting

55
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:50,850
at fifteen night 1575 pointed 42 mega
herds of GPS at 8250 DBS DBS satellite

56
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,260
broadcaster GPS signals in different
frequency band and different modulation

57
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,270
01 signal either most economists'
signaling in civil uses the stress of

58
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,490
signal received its very weak as about
minus

59
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:16,449
130 bpm and most GPS receivers we don't
have to endure it makes the GPS signal

60
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,949
interference or spoofing quite easy
things that hackers don't need to

61
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,370
generate a signal strong enough to
omarska Darrell 700 Kb

62
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:35,050
me IDC found wage stand for broadcaster
if I'm rates data contains a unique GPS

63
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,060
satellite phone messages for sure if I'm
amazed at how provide the exact location

64
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:49,310
date on which is X X TTY TDD an orbit
parameters of each set price so that

65
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,220
receivers can get priority information
in order to calculate position of the

66
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,220
supplies you can download be RDC

67
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,159
from over remix format from ftv so
overall nasa Iranians to stand for or

68
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:10,610
receive very independent to exchange it
for Matt it's a date are you don't

69
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:16,639
change the format for joy satellite
navigation system data files are named

70
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,620
in the voting scheme by rules in this
table yet for those who didn't hear

71
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,469
three digit day of the year

72
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:36,960
come pester you need to file its ok for
example PID fee 350 400 time and means

73
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:46,109
December attendees 2014 yeah since
December 2008 season 354 stay on the

74
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:53,889
year 2014 2014 ok for our for a long
time he's only concept of this kind of

75
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,430
GPA's of smoking and there is no
available running called it but not

76
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,880
there is one but first let me show the
hardware platform we needed for this

77
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,979
experiment to trust me into the signals
into reality we need to software defined

78
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,440
radio platforms such as like I've played
our if you're a star P

79
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,850
every time I open source as Dr platform
using USB USB 2.0 interface operates on

80
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,740
frequency band from 10 megahertz 26 cue
cards supporting a maximum

81
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:38,210
separate off food 27 holes per second
but only half duplex average is designed

82
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:45,220
it is probably publicly available from
hosted driver to somewhere and even

83
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:54,480
hardly our scheme and PCB layout and the
book and they are all open source USB

84
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,840
3.0 interface operates frequency band
from 300 megahertz to 3.28 gigahertz

85
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,110
supporting independent to I attacks and
tell beach accommodation and a faulty

86
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,750
mega SPS carburetor sampling and the
full two packs which means it can

87
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,450
transmit and receive a signal at the
same time they dive seems to have a

88
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,650
better radio frequency perform
performance CNC to use these only one

89
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:32,930
and a radio chip to support all of the
working radio frequency range but how

90
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,900
can I radio frequency switches and
comforters PCB board to expand and

91
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,939
they're all working for him see to
olajuwon which brings it quite a lot of

92
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:50,850
radio power lines but according to the
our experiment both GPS signal

93
00:09:50,850 --> 00:10:01,680
transmitted by a knife and blade ARF can
be decoded by regular GPS receiver GPS

94
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,410
SCR seem

95
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,900
project which is an open source GPS
based on second order to generate her

96
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,910
release time MIT license to principles
of this project needs a Japanese man

97
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,250
Koji

98
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,330
but we have contributed codes of state
the state and local location feature

99
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,900
which is the miners out switch and we
also contribute it laid off script to

100
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,689
support to this project it takes a
really remember it needs formatting the

101
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:41,620
GPS infamous archives and location as
the input and generates GPS baseband

102
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,740
signal for STR platform to playback
first wave check out the cold it from

103
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:56,540
Gig Harbor a pole and then come back and
install this project and then jet

104
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,480
generated based on some hoes according
to your position using minor cell

105
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,960
location so each

106
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:15,150
you can trust me too strong SDI devices
and that's all we also have contributed

107
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,060
to a capital R

108
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:26,739
switch for like I've project you can use
half transfer program 22 to send it to

109
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,480
TX to some hoes it's very handy because
the GPI thought they are seem project

110
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,640
only generates a sample of three minutes
maximum well GPS receivers probably

111
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,420
don't have enough time to company d 1st
at UPS capture process injustice really

112
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:55,890
needs okay let us see some experimental
results and the left side it's a common

113
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:05,170
eurobonds GPS receiver with a Linux
project called the GST on the right side

114
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:11,860
this is right yeah it's an app called GV
have tests on Android smartphone as we

115
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,750
can see both with words candy coated are
generated a fake GPS signals correctly

116
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:27,190
ok for iPhone when CBS Sports starts to
positioning data off iPhone can BJD doll

117
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:35,000
so evenly life I understand our services
which style and so Apple devices seem to

118
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,680
trusted GPR state ha that's quite a high
level makes experiment when GPS

119
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,000
supporting it stopped but without a
receiving I R L GPS signal statement I'm

120
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,930
going to be fixed immediately according
to and he's always form wi-fi or

121
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:03,719
cellular network speeds and either to
understand the open an hour to get a

122
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,770
strong and stable rail GPS signal direct
action won't be fixed for at least 10

123
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,420
minutes which she's pretty annoying

124
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,770
evenly tried to switch the automated
timing to offer and said all right I'm

125
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:29,030
back at MIT timing is right there to our
it all back to the fact I'm a gay

126
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:35,459
sissies I think he said because he has
time cash healthy long life

127
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:47,420
iPhone ok wait St Tampa wards the photo
I would love to see that the date on the

128
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:54,479
time ever world's was cheated by GPS
signal in this case it's changed the to

129
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,710
December 20th 2014 while Darrell local
time he's doing twenties 2015

130
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:09,620
since Sep 08 season fully synchronized
with iPhone and she's pretty

131
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:17,100
straightforward I think the picture on
the right shows their photos or

132
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,379
screenshot taken with iPhone

133
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:27,059
as it's time we be inserted into a fake
into effect timestamp into their

134
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:33,410
photostream for example you might
remember where I take a screenshot each

135
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,759
of us can find each other bottom of my
photostream this comfy with me for wile

136
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:46,999
ago nowadays more and more about the
absolute positioning d'etat to bring

137
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:54,329
more suitable some ways to users but
isn't that so AB trusted position they

138
00:14:54,329 --> 00:15:02,149
don't totally for example a taxi calling
out over and Daddy taxi taxis a popular

139
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:09,189
out on a TV app in China yeah you can be
easily achieved using this GPS will have

140
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:19,269
message against a season jet hand dryer
and receives ed tech see the left shows

141
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:27,069
that location-based ads like AV chat we
see it's a popular message in China also

142
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:36,128
cheated location label when posting
grades job but Joe graphic labels like

143
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:42,819
night process can be also cheated too

144
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:52,728
ok then was moving in W introduce a
cheaper peso 22 positions only needs a

145
00:15:52,729 --> 00:16:02,759
laptop wifi assisted locations and GPS
positioning went walking towards

146
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,069
position in service providers such as
Apple Maps Google Maps often use wifi

147
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:12,728
signal to help users to get a better
position than performances to print

148
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:17,259
principal example the voters chipset on
his cell phone to collect information

149
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:23,429
off all strongly WiFi hotspots the key
information to help position needs as I

150
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:33,728
D&B SSID SSID means and sarees sad
identification display name or Fri haha

151
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:39,789
sport be a society which stands for
basic service set identification is a

152
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:44,970
MAC address of the wireless access point
AP are positioning service provider

153
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,869
blacks SSID and BSSID I guess our GPS
data into the our positioning a safe

154
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:55,119
place sometimes the information
collected process is a company did you

155
00:16:55,119 --> 00:17:02,549
use a cell phone for example I go to
sleep for Apple's website which I call

156
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:08,339
these calculations are performed live as
iPhone into a crowd-sourced database

157
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,938
offers wi-fi hotspots and cell tower
data it's generated by tens of millions

158
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,819
of iPhones sending geotagged location on
the nearby wi-fi hot spots and cell

159
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:28,000
towers 89 anonymous encrypted form to
Apple so what about we generate some

160
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,460
societies and DSi DS in order to see
whether those positioning service can be

161
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,690
cheated on art

162
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,129
the most straightforward idea is to look
like that does it manually and Jim by a

163
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:50,668
lot of writers writers setting that BS
societies and that's a good idea of each

164
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,950
other according to our needs it will be
great I had a job to accompany too so we

165
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,159
we need to come up with a more effective
approach first we need to crack the SSID

166
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:11,070
and beer this idea wrong for Linux we
have I W util which can easily cracked

167
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,970
those aidid in order to speed up the
joint a walk scraped my family K street

168
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:22,279
dog too precise I double dog food for
later use they will see the output later

169
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,330
if you don't use all Mac OS 10 you can
use a ponytail shipped within your

170
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,080
system we also have a simple but
effective bash script to help you

171
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,279
collected those data more effective to
be in my case I took a taxi to like

172
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,070
about it

173
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:48,259
20 position in ICT all I need to do is
pressing her enduring taxi or hate to

174
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:54,860
say that a caballo only need a Linux
laptop bios Scott first we need to

175
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,399
install empty case rain which aims to
exploit common

176
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:08,320
802 11 protocol to change their voting
like you make fire in order to make a

177
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,970
comeback come out successfully in recent
operating system and genuine order to

178
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,059
generate fake has ideas because we need
to setup the wireless card to monitor

179
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:26,740
mode that way to do this one is using
crack energy package of wage and another

180
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:34,549
is just using I double counting ok then
we can start to become flood attack

181
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:44,970
using be and miners we stretch and
results

182
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:51,240
regard to the position shown in the top
left of the map to collect data to make

183
00:19:51,240 --> 00:20:02,270
at the bottom right pin map to reply to
a society's ok this picture shows the

184
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,280
fake the position that way they capture
the essence and disco I think he's my

185
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,700
girlfriend

186
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,570
BSSID an SSID d'etat be collected so
take a big surprise and types of movies

187
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,340
or keyboard afterwards I'm getting there
were published in water at night you can

188
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:30,699
try to do this experiment later by
yourself I think it stopped flood a lot

189
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,750
of fake IDs can be scanned using our
telephone but societies as I can seek an

190
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,559
order p

191
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:46,340
attach the successful D which is as we
expected then the way opened by to map

192
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:53,658
it's a popular map for China back since
we were kind of you it's gone you know

193
00:20:53,659 --> 00:21:00,620
how the position is abstracted
successfully i think thats what I i do

194
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:14,800
this experiment group site we should
have a right right right bottom point

195
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,360
ok for WiFi assistant position things
going in there also another or other

196
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,830
possibilities when time is affecting
such as a thousand implicate for example

197
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:34,360
we know that the expiry date off for SSL
certificate is very important i dont use

198
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,110
a subject am from an enemy to attack a
base station frequency offsets we also

199
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,649
found out that this GPS commands that
can also interfere 266 it signalled a

200
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,680
cellular network based I spent most of
base stations in cellular networks rely

201
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,770
on PBS which means policy per second
signal which derived from GPS technology

202
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:03,389
calibrate frequency offset it trust me
to the fake could signal which contains

203
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:10,440
a high air on PBS and the LTE base
station automatically sync race PPI

204
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,220
signal and the whole route network
frequency or increased 24 about 250

205
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:26,060
hurts to 11,000 hurts which can cause
the base station fighting for work and

206
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,770
and services provide time
synchronization service or internet

207
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,150
connection and my stuff and he's always
use GPS time and they are upstream

208
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:43,270
source if anti-peace overseas affected
by factors and I think the impact would

209
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,550
be enormous

210
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:53,090
so we will give some suggestions on
positioning security for developers run

211
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,689
you can add a position and the daytime
check based on continuous principal

212
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,730
position and I'm hoping should be wary
fight or 12 to give us more about your

213
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,040
myspace

214
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,330
to add a separate caulking hardware
modules for example in a Porsche

215
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:20,169
straight victory the cash time from GPS
positioning signal according to our the

216
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,179
cash time of GPS acquisition radar

217
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:27,289
should be decreased cease not
appropriate for WiFi GPS position to be

218
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:33,669
cashed in for a long parade and for our
data manually refresh GPS cash function

219
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:40,070
I think it's necessary to provide a
four-star function for position and when

220
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:47,460
you find out that position suspicious
and five high-priority time think device

221
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,820
based on NDP or SSL for example since
the internet connection is more reliable

222
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,570
for more like I said I'm sorry native in
the NTP or I thought I'm source should

223
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,539
be lifted the toy higher priority in my
system I think GPS signal strength

224
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:13,779
detect fake GPS signals are often much
stronger and much more uniform time

225
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,470
showing in this picture

226
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,799
almost signal strengths China could be
used as they did hack identification I

227
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,200
think the last one

228
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,980
wi-fi positioning data providers should
have to trust verification for their

229
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,169
database in order to exclude them holds
you know you should never trust to

230
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:47,909
include in Concord we have introduced to
matters of position of spoofing is

231
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:52,360
important for developers and vendors to
examining physician time they'd have

232
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,320
more closely and more frequently and
more effectively be high as a basic

233
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,809
security principal anyways are you
shouldn't be trusted to completely

234
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:07,960
besides we have also submitted to a
relevant technical details to Apple put

235
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,980
up to security team we would also like
to thank dr. number of CIT are China

236
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,539
economy or who attend economy
communication research you are Carla

237
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:23,950
frequency offset enough interference or
space station would also like to thank

238
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,279
you now Association over to my
university for the help some experiments

239
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,830
ok

240
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:56,879
any questions ok which card ok ok maybe
it's a place where I think radar for her

241
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:07,710
I think because I F performance is
better than if you had the lower price

242
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:17,549
and open-source blood think and you SRP
of this is the type he's B 210 I think

243
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:54,320
he's very expensive than other tool I
think you use a high-end on strong

244
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:08,019
strains I think it's enough to cover a
like 10 or 11 years I think it's pretty

245
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:15,330
low about 1-130 DBA it is below the
noise

246
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:31,659
and not knowing that our I think so so
it is very easy to be very honest I

247
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,210
think later you can tell you about this
much Eric undo the wi-fi positioning

248
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:43,920
spoof experiment just taking your Linux
laptop it's a very simple and you can

249
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,240
try to look like to the point I think
there are times when you get back to the

250
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,730
USA are two other country you can just a
fake the state in the position

251
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:19,810
ok are gonna actually the BRD see that
have brought us because it takes a while

252
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:29,550
and then stands for another tracked her
down for Acronis so tight I think he's a

253
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:36,860
very simple to do this another two
minutes

254
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:49,520
any other questions quickly I think it's
very simple you can't you can't do it by

255
00:28:49,520 --> 00:29:04,039
yourself wedding

256
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:25,190
i cost for WiFi it costs nothing it's
it's $0 are not on my wifi smoking

257
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:33,090
doesn't need to ask Dr device Dr

258
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:39,720
if I think he's about to $300

259
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:47,599
your combined farm great to start and
played eye-fi thinking about 200 orders

260
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:54,189
may be in for a blade off we fought
without he's great to the smarts and

261
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:03,220
that's how I can remember actually

262
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:23,760
$0.13 monologue 1050 and 75.2 partner
megahertz its 1.5 gigahertz not fifteen

263
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,629
yards

264
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:32,840
the frequency trust the transformation
is a traditional communication message

265
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,459
about 15

266
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,669
Dr hurts or 52 hurts its come behind
handled using a try I transformation

267
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:51,299
such as such as some some reader
comments it's very simple so you got her

268
00:30:51,299 --> 00:31:39,910
number and you can just see it's a very
large number i think im you may be right

269
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:46,930
everybody
