1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,810
thank you all for coming to my talk and
will come to enter posts and entries and

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:13,349
relocations security vulnerabilities to
get north end this is my Chinese name

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,259
masters from national Cheng kung
University Taiwan now two years and

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,019
these areas such as part of my master's
thesis currently walking I'm go tech and

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,650
we do something similar to comment

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:37,589
security and verify Pollensa Howard
protections and I are upstanding my

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:51,940
employer years and older blonde beauty's
enlist lies have been disclosed to the

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,379
barber survivors early so not only is ok
first I'll start with introduces

9
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:03,059
introducing a C Andris accurate
background and nato introduced white and

10
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,119
how andrew Cuomo decide and some
interesting doctors

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,600
Andrew application and how and robust
with the attacks some of the ball

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,330
beauties and finally I will tell you how
and robust will house the pecking

13
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:28,250
records and move a pass because my
slides have 190 pages as security basis

14
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:36,909
as you can see from this cream shops
every application create X 10 bucks by

15
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:44,020
business users in Grady and use are you
starting from 10,000 for Norway so even

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,439
to ABS want to sure they died with each
other they both need to specify the

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,710
stand and reassurance I D in Andhra
benefits as sign we've lost and the TV

18
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,990
most companies do not consider yes
values security hole if you have

19
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:08,970
basically two device so allowing bigger
in Andhra buses and will be considered

20
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,020
as the law probably won't be a problem

21
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,810
change and as previous so if you'd
probably just a critical eye Master

22
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,820
Chief and resistant to cap the rout of
age you actually exploiting the

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,540
situation holy and resistant not that
occasion yourself and today we're

24
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:39,540
talking about LeBron duties in
applications so why do i end kitchen

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,980
won't be scanner pick you up at four
years there have been a lot of

26
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,859
interesting research about as a security
mobile kitchens the most significant

27
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,720
research is presently in essence it is
the most dangerous Co in a world that is

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:08,310
the case in no bra top no bra silver
also researching ways to hang wit and we

29
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,930
just kept coming 18 but still but today
still no security properties creation

30
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:23,140
arsov completed so the same mistakes
have been made again come to know all

31
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,958
about care about security or religious
forget so in recent years there are

32
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,950
songs that he or deny me and there's a
storm coming so draws a good though I

33
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,820
want to price a critical host I don't
really want to instil efforts to find

34
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:48,180
out if you want to and I and some
commercial tours such as 45 and check

35
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,730
Mapei expense and they need a so called
and which is not suitable for

36
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:03,060
penetration acres in 2014 most
comprehensive list are also starting to

37
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,150
do they all security and application and
replication will be scanners but still

38
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,450
probably need to pay money to report and
so I might also may need all ties to

39
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,010
analyze so you may have to wait for at
least five to 10 minutes took a report

40
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,240
by the way the message and an assist you
do not support it

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,960
so that means to do so is a friend will
help you find security vulnerabilities

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,599
and revocations is almost always in
reading pipe is a steady and that is

43
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,009
stored in your entry fee case so he
doesn't need your sort of course and

44
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:48,599
kansas forward the number no common cold
import duties which also means that you

45
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:54,770
can for your logic old security issues
and it's a very efficient and doesn't

46
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,849
need much time to scan for your
applications and you can easily extend

47
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:05,599
new features were made it back to us
okay so knowing how to find the ball

48
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,919
booties but checks before the coaches
meeting the best part is getting

49
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:18,169
sensitive information or has shown
interest shows come in and help you find

50
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:23,330
more beauties as a loan deal with the
threat of interactions and broken when

51
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:32,240
you come fix and some reliable more
readable and truck so some companies

52
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,020
sure you hear about security more beauty
modification developed orders only care

53
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,099
about whether cute even happier Bobo
application products and here are some

54
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:50,669
companies that recognize won't be sorry
POTUS so in trouble for minor help you

55
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,690
find security hold territory but at
least he can shoot you

56
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,180
we research and Nicole and final you may
find a security hoped so that's the most

57
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,190
important thing so do you sell more
beauties

58
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:15,190
nature's so decide catcher so in regards
to compile the ENTER button will however

59
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,509
enterococcus nasa Poulter security more
beauty to check checking originally so I

60
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:28,479
modify and added some code is from work
and other tools are used the GDP cold or

61
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,820
a PGA Tour as data compiled and robust
when will use Andrew guys

62
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,930
become pilot because I think it is much
more reliable yes and the general

63
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,500
technique for finding both of us in war
first and replace them with Search

64
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:54,330
Engine both from with the compiler apk
by Andrew got a second and robust war

65
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,800
finds the potentially ball Boko so it
would depend on the implementation of

66
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:08,110
the actors so it goes back to the
potentially by Boko entries again to

67
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,880
confirm if it is about it on duties so
she prolly is that and robust wolf does

68
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:24,270
not try to analyze every aisle only does
he finds something interesting if I

69
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:32,409
print as we have to finish this can
affect title courthouse

70
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:40,240
actor category Peter recommendation and
some pretty links and show you listen

71
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,520
each factor so as you can see December
10th level from highest to lowest so

72
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,320
absolutely means higher parties to
create my own people tease so in a very

73
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,060
only tells you laugh and robustness
appalled

74
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:04,940
doctor checking and introduce you to a
new system interest and robust than

75
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,590
water so they are free

76
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,919
engines commonly used by enter both but
when working environment effects the

77
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,090
steady engine's efficiency

78
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:21,679
engines and beauty and so this data
entries to call of Interbus when water

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,220
is used by someone beauty factors

80
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,890
fighting potential security
vulnerabilities the most important thing

81
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:37,289
and robust and long as the coast
ethically and partial he tries to guess

82
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:44,010
or predict a petition speech have you
with all running tab

83
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:50,560
so just enjoy the steady dvdengine
maintains the same correct stable

84
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,790
compared to the real TV or out on you
enter operating system used these

85
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:05,709
instructions remove remove remove result
common Whirlpool previous calculations

86
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:13,060
result we register and so it seems that
is not running a TV in or out so we saw

87
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:21,680
his so cruelly resourceful directors
table and so for example nieces example

88
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,670
of the dangers more readable coal
accounts in one in the second parameter

89
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,740
sheer means store in the proper in this
single readable mom and in a further

90
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:44,020
line co gas the shoeprints Optus so why
you need two caddies sure you want to

91
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:54,620
entice the dangerous or readable ok so y
clear the media files you mean about

92
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,280
alleged table for some instruction like
a cat I guess or a skirt

93
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,939
well is because that usually cold
interest ek to get some information on

94
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:16,800
long time no see information on
ostankino you really need to analyze

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,279
so this is just an example showing
interest from any of it

96
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,970
emulating a basic TV end so it will help
you with analyzing some factors for

97
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:35,079
example when wrong in the first time in
over Troy dasher preference so Andrew

98
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:41,149
Moore knows the first and the second
parameter hours this street is that the

99
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:45,959
file and the new ex-wife

100
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:54,790
so joie and robust will search for
potential function Co Sophia was first

101
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,410
so I'll fighting the potential involved
in coastal feels it goes back to restore

102
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:08,120
all the functions of course mining coal
one-by-one to confirm is is a powerful

103
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,519
ability so if enter bustling with us and
find the potential to be able to analyze

104
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,610
from the start of the function and Steph
an aristide

105
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:29,760
lighting by khou.com mostly so it is
much more efficient compared to any

106
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,250
tolls and I currently there are some
open source and reputation for beauties

107
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,290
gainers

108
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:48,790
risk in the Empire tropic all my records
pressure more so if I know I can always

109
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:57,240
look over our records pressure is very
slow so and robust and even five to ten

110
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:06,000
times as true in Los tools to analyze
low drama caught smuggling colon

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,500
Michael yeah

112
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,110
so it's just a TV and radio walking

113
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,600
seen a steady nge is not a real deviant
login your Android phone so he doesn't

114
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,180
know for example least two or fewer

115
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:31,439
boy so you must you must know something
talks letter post and I managed to such

116
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,360
as export from wall to wall is actually
I think so but I'm sure they'll vote BBQ

117
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,630
by static analysis first is now quite
you to start with you because you will

118
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,060
take you too much title install and test
shoot petitions especially if you want

119
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:59,189
to 50 beauties lots of outpatient ok so
if the second one is the teamsters entry

120
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:05,230
you were used to record suppression to
social strains but it is quite

121
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:12,510
also well-known wonder fine weather to
Street Ste still not but it still is but

122
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:20,410
perhaps 20 cities so come see the index
file this transaction needs to be

123
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:27,350
reduced signs and text so enjoy streams
are referenced by East indisposition

124
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:36,470
another were upset yesterday so true
another at a store in a catalyst for

125
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:44,670
functions index file and the staff and
robust first oldest trees light to IDs

126
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:51,020
industry night at ten seconds if I is
the strains by users imposed and got a

127
00:13:51,020 --> 00:14:01,640
correspondence IDC research to cope with
up construction do X 12 X 12 X 18 X 18

128
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:09,670
and compare ideas in step 2 so if the
train search engine in ENTER button war

129
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,740
is actually comparing the integer ok

130
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,430
so the entrance to own tent cities is
not humans so it does the text some

131
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:31,489
informations so far by spam filter
functions in beauty entrance

132
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,170
advertisement by Bruce nearby beauties
so it's now or to report a province to

133
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:46,160
them so in this case of actors
implementations can filter result for

134
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:55,290
you so you won't be back to implement it
in Andhra but OK

135
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,380
concepts and ideas on how and robust
that won't go bad practice are

136
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:09,470
implemented in entered this phone looks
so we're back to see directors will come

137
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:16,010
from basically I read and recite could
have built before starting his research

138
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:24,500
and the fundamental security in end to a
petition in court

139
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:32,850
redstone pass research papers won't post
rocks and try to fly off it is possible

140
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:42,589
to make Lynn into the into lab actors
and robust than work how to create a new

141
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:50,730
vectors fi older dude information about
this later I'll make a simple app and

142
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:58,010
running on different profiles for
example and rice beans or kick ass lol

143
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:06,240
of entry emulators to buy reply to
ensuring reproduce so consider all

144
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,380
possible cases you'll need to regular
documents on entry life-size is a very

145
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,160
important and stings the textile want to
do the factors in and robust

146
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:24,480
oriented so you'll need to know why is
the snorting coke 0 of 0 in cocoa

147
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,180
it is simply to compile of proof proof
of concept map to see the snorting coke

148
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,079
and seeing how to add you back to her
into and robust

149
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:44,329
so after new factories decide and
reports from when will he needs to be

150
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:51,888
testy we have horrible app and mobile
app so you make sure that the system can

151
00:16:51,889 --> 00:17:00,920
surely find these possibilities and to
fostering the accuracy you use my lapse

152
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,849
test passing and maybe fixed abode
evening plantation is not correct

153
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:14,899
k I'm going to do with myself and
because of the time comes I will give

154
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,780
you a few examples are bogus and how
implementing them and robust and work

155
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:29,620
and some blonde beauty's interesting
findings where research on the coal mine

156
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,479
this is my routines to buy if i dont
wanna be released first EP Katie and I

157
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,929
think we've entered bustling work so

158
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:46,790
system will generate a report after the
skin if we're opposed potential security

159
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:53,000
vulnerabilities I mean by all the tools
I A B Couture Gadag sister shot into

160
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,780
Downey announces it is a viable beauties

161
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:08,950
how how do I come through if it is I'll
make you should always tried to make a

162
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,130
pool forecast at apt to prove and
demonstrate the stability severity of

163
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:22,080
security for the fighting's ok so the
war readable and writable so I talked

164
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,760
about his doctor lee has more readable
or writable means the finals allows our

165
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,570
kitchen to read or write stories so from
Google and read about website is very

166
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,780
dangerous and likely to cause security

167
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:46,129
so after recession lows recession low
salary functions let me use more

168
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:55,300
readable or writable ok so I'm finding
the Sunshine Coast entered into a steady

169
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:03,300
the entrance to check them to see if it
is between 12 streets and Rapala one we

170
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,230
all know

171
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:14,350
proposal wines not use the form below
constants about it so I do more worried

172
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,830
about to push messaging library allows
stores pushed measure is a talking war

173
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:26,360
more worried about so many bad and
replication use these bomb vol by to

174
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,560
push the measure died but so is
important now the library lekin clings

175
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:43,330
the Volvo coal may be used by any
applications are no more readable on

176
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,610
beauty and joy in TK microsoft office
for bio does not experienced after you

177
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:56,010
max so if you do not standing you makes
it is much more permissive and rice yes

178
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:03,390
so he means every application can steal
the file you downloaded from one crisis

179
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,710
if you aren't you are using dendritic

180
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:13,160
alleged ties when users excels

181
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:25,620
hoping crimes only dunkel farm near 1332
stands for users are on and ok coming by

182
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,080
to more BTM director director travel
cover source so accountable by the usury

183
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:38,970
there are two come next to the sequel I
database provides some drivers

184
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,460
datasource so and read about some
possible catalyst at the school instead

185
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,990
install wider and wider application to
is an instant

186
00:20:49,990 --> 00:21:00,350
file directory so does not static spoke
about content provider and talking SDK

187
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:09,250
version 02 seventeens to be heaviest
understand in NGL and rice and why

188
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,990
development mainly exported IPL able
legal or equal to seventeens the next

189
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:21,910
level lower than seventeens is not
saying that if it is it's pulled his arm

190
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:29,059
AP la belleza seventeens so you must be
a mistakes and robust highlight these

191
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:37,840
coming wider communities so this is a
bad actors they keep on keepin we just

192
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:46,530
spoke a daytime high speed the
sensitivity

193
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:56,270
news content provided in US exports is
top quality settings which means it is

194
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:02,150
exported by the evil empire

195
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:11,850
kool you can see allows the patient to
ASUS the files and a sketch directory so

196
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:25,320
unfortunate use the File API so there
are no child proof of concept either

197
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,189
used the Microsoft being Android to
search Facebook and talking to your

198
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,929
Facebook com well any application on the
device can steal the place these places

199
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:44,510
Hawkins and cover my super cups of 64
duties within two weeks

200
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:52,059
by the way you should always choose a
good job at the compiler least to the

201
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,670
comp so is a very famous

202
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,740
so

203
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:07,020
you can see disco music or or or not
always be executed on these to compile

204
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:15,580
but you always thought final not found
exceptions but this is not correct and

205
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,500
this one is the correct one

206
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:30,300
the web you file a formal to exporting
companies so allows developers to embed

207
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:37,080
a web browsers into applications and
robustness of polls finding many more

208
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,678
beauty is his company gershwin's

209
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:48,840
feels so one of the beauties East allow
fireplaces so if you said his

210
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,540
said sure yet which means to be ideal
for you allow our dedication to reason

211
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:07,889
is internal files or databases we've
curbed tu I so enjoy is is that it is

212
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:19,890
cold and the links data links from my
browser url and navigate to a link to

213
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:34,520
this file is in use web so so proud to
be the fire was 10 bucks or militia

214
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:43,920
pages and pages our car so i cant
randy's

215
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:51,000
beauties first I find a function calls
to action in the settings and install

216
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,990
all goals and take a trip with Cassie
Sant network design includes the

217
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:05,950
function calls to set up a fight is so
horrible so if the set off our cases

218
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,530
functions including to study the engine
and recall lows that last final is a

219
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:19,309
sweet shop so it won't be with his top
and robust

220
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:31,530
finds that is a long booties in trouble
codes and deals but if I find beauty and

221
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:38,230
there's tools line Peters or pursuit pay
since there are many papers that the

222
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,750
beauties and replications I think I
don't need to explain how and replace

223
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:52,100
them with the Texas it won't be so close
to an earlier version of Yahoo now the

224
00:25:52,100 --> 00:26:00,840
stink hole come tear the issue however
the most interesting thing is that the

225
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,610
login page does not happen as long as
you can

226
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,800
isn't talking from listingyou'll can
request

227
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:22,480
almost before a concrete bridge so we
encourage users information and so in

228
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:33,960
2014 here to steal NBC's most important
application products and unfortunately

229
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,660
when you log into your yahoo mail the
first time I asked you if you want to

230
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,490
see me doing so is there is no end

231
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:53,380
interested in you stanza broke his that
contain sensitive information is not

232
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:01,150
experienced SAP specified at Esplanade
nations all employees bouquets and

233
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:10,780
developers have multiple ways to protect
the broadcast making do we turn their

234
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,190
attentions or a local

235
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:25,559
in order so that your IP reported about
Yahoo and beauties

236
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:33,320
if you do no wrong messenger and toy
full-grown Yahoo Messenger will pop-up

237
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:44,040
notification and receiving messages at
least one so unfortunate way everyone

238
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:55,440
received your message to the team and
since the broadcast without specifying

239
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:07,929
receiving permission so so they're
tighter can make its sporty exported

240
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:15,420
brokers receiver and received these
messages and I'm receiving the new

241
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:23,790
messages app will print the message in
Knox so you can see the private message

242
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,700
here

243
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,240
ok

244
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,170
to register on protective of his
receivers so Android developer sunk rise

245
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:42,010
to prepare then I mean good records
turbo case receiver the only noticed

246
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:49,030
security protection of aesthetically
register for his receiver and so their

247
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:55,700
tech battery is dead after applications
can stand the bull case to change is

248
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:08,480
original behavior and also to keep me
happy must be dispensed ev-one

249
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:16,740
you should use the signature attention
to protect your bouquets from being

250
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,940
triggered by any malicious applications
so its example

251
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:34,620
trudeau by Android and security team
recognize anyone beauties so by Android

252
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,189
registers for case receivers

253
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:49,470
activity so I received the CEO albeit
entry that finished Paul case it would

254
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:56,940
turn out ok so no more you can are
forced to terminate and applications we

255
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:06,240
found a system privilege and cautionary
volatilities in Novi entering harry's

256
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:15,820
the base action by deputies so if the
pace batista's finish applications Coast

257
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:26,810
safely and you can Steve Sapp casing
here he tries to bouquets everything s/m

258
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,570
so

259
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:36,189
we saw you can always use the CEO
televised by Andrew Duffy bouquets

260
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,100
repeatedly

261
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:49,689
so it is in system occasions so the
Android system has a PC application

262
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:57,679
protection you can I install apps from
allen also said if you got to Settings

263
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:05,909
app securities and allow almost always
it's so if you are now I'll also show

264
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:16,220
you this warning messages ok but then it
needs you can bypass these unknown

265
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:23,639
source check so package installer
activities of his package installer he

266
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:31,709
has call install directory that can be
set by external application so even

267
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:41,820
installed there are you sad shoe shoe
that all morning long not more precise

268
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:48,029
city he means that every application can
set the install directory value true

269
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:56,740
true bypass the unknown source check so
you'll never see her in cell block

270
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:03,210
against where install in a new
application if you do not allow occasion

271
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:10,210
for a long time no source so from a
previous life there must be some won't

272
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:26,259
be a problem this and this takes up
again so I mean to do see you in our

273
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:36,710
stores and robust integrated with Google
TV which he won't seek out there are

274
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,850
babies

275
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:49,189
results will be sold by tidy infection
in for later analysis so why do the

276
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:58,030
massive gains first I find companies and
their interpretations and seconds I

277
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,700
wrong

278
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:05,080
massive energy stores and I sign the
targeting of all boosted by better I D

279
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:14,770
gas burners repose phone and then some
kind trying to read a call when somehow

280
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:24,100
coast and two dynamic analyses and try
to reproduce the vulnerabilities and it

281
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:31,490
takes time and patience to reproduce so
even takes more time for you to teach

282
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:36,990
company Security Response Center today
don't know interest charities and three

283
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:50,160
others interested in Andrews securities
and I'll make a cool comes out to prove

284
00:33:50,160 --> 00:34:02,700
that it is a very bumpy course for you
to do the massive analyses

285
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:09,110
a media file of all good he want to
research so pick six samples

286
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:17,140
apt want to analyze and make it unique
and as a tech a number for skins and

287
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,699
support in simply wrong

288
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:27,799
scanners so it was dark and I are
absolutely wrong to you when I want to

289
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,680
give you a quick quick painless

290
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:49,290
that's we just cannot fight also
indications

291
00:34:49,290 --> 00:35:13,070
so

292
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:35,880
for bifurcation spektr and the severity
levels for example it would now have the

293
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:51,300
web or so I basis so the fight on
application occasion that enables

294
00:35:51,300 --> 00:37:04,530
couples so there's a report about Turkey
to optimize

295
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:49,850
to check

296
00:37:49,850 --> 00:38:07,230
ok crater that too strange things so for
example can find we should have used by

297
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,740
trust tell us everything we do

298
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:20,520
examples so it is trust you to pay money
to buy something like special kids so I

299
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:29,440
micro fiber deep know he's unable to
login with your username and password

300
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:37,580
needs a blueprint your username password
box so and so we've massive announces

301
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:48,250
you can find these movies immediate and
robust tractors for you to check the

302
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,980
protection of May by the jobless so

303
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,470
category ente least specifically
designed for ATK repetitive behaviors

304
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:07,049
fourth on the back hurts we've hacker
categories on our booties

305
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:14,420
already know how you are calling to
Petra solar me several tracks to protect

306
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:22,470
the applications so I will protect
yourself not at night using just a

307
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:30,629
country is now for sale is it detected
signs to difficulties in a match we

308
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:39,410
produced by one so it becomes unable to
use a lot of us will help you find the

309
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:47,420
trap homes faster we can remove or
modify here this morning hope he keeps

310
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:53,590
you so freaking

311
00:39:53,590 --> 00:40:03,090
so this is also keen yeah application
must only trust through certificates you

312
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:10,330
specify his own casual so which prevails
the media in with text even if the money

313
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:23,750
issue is installed in so down there is a
penis but we want to make up modify add

314
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:30,740
or reverse engineer hackers would like
to prove the 10+2 declined to the keys

315
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:39,810
to allow for minimal tech so I want to
know is to test certificated has only

316
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:55,130
package so so were the call to load the
possible casual occasion so here's an

317
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,920
example

318
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,730
andrew is using the opinions so no way
you can now create a connection we've

319
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:11,820
placed on motorists overrun the amido
even if you as you all know that if k to

320
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:23,320
your device ok so is there any Mido
environment so you can see that the main

321
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,770
actors always cannot create a connection
we've christopher's

322
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:42,230
is a report on durable and robust fine
the possible testimony and where is and

323
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:49,050
where is loaded and you can see and
robust and water least the fattest man

324
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,150
named stores the password to open

325
00:41:51,150 --> 00:42:02,910
ok so you can use a tool which is called
upon

326
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:12,690
to you can only find one to suit if the
cable at this time workers East using

327
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:24,190
them in pole your trust that he proposed
the trust that the modified if I know we

328
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,160
start again

329
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:38,578
ok so I installed a modified carpenter's
and joy to many toes and you can see

330
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:44,630
that now attracting now your username
and password

331
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:53,430
ok and so absolutely back to pecos

332
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:59,299
militia diversification and truthful
point for ordering UFC fight it will pop

333
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:05,890
up notification to users and saying
there's an hour maybe monitor now we're

334
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:11,160
making my interest and is the Boko

335
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:19,049
when we want to see more locks so late
enable at the global threat so

336
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:27,589
developers Travis threat to see if there
are any me so I'm step over for website

337
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:29,190
Andrew

338
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:37,510
open use these coal to track why they're
the application is in typical own ok so

339
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:46,940
even deeper it enable applications may
not shocked me I try to use it to buy

340
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:53,150
people so we should understand behavior
as the release so you want to be able to

341
00:43:53,150 --> 00:44:00,490
see more locks and remained a function
to stand as the release version ok so

342
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,538
the solution is to break it

343
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:12,259
so how does enter but find these deeper
more check ins high chair ice rink or

344
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:21,099
taking debacle and first social research
and applications in for facts and gas

345
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:25,099
next instruction simply post

346
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:33,939
analyze the read 80 biko to make sure
they match the checking typical pattern

347
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:42,149
working at the kitchen sink base
protection so you find a be happier and

348
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:49,099
that is different for example unable to
login and password after to Rebecca

349
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:55,699
juneau app probably absence checking to
see you sure and has to be a steak

350
00:44:55,699 --> 00:45:02,229
dinner true pace protections and some
noms

351
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:05,439
case you have to text cannot be signed
we

352
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:11,209
private activities so the comparison you
truly feel pretty find one so if you

353
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:21,178
compare fails me crash or can I use the
features so past perhaps USA

354
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:26,130
how to be spiteful is very popular on
YouTube

355
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:32,799
demonstrating a spiteful he's

356
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:41,409
packaging ok but the truth is now sold
out so he's a to package it will have

357
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:48,380
tried to remain applications is because
in truth about arranging know you are

358
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:55,309
going to heck with text a half only
track and compare this to true we seem

359
00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:03,029
to understand so if you are you you
should you are using the master key

360
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:11,550
duties normally you have occasion cast
iron we shall

361
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:20,900
so tracks for these applications
typically so how 5.2 enjoy you find you

362
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:30,100
repair AB you can no longer looking to
enjoy success so far more help you find

363
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:35,390
the senior trip based security
protections and you can have the

364
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:44,170
directions to remove the protections ok
so from a report of the enterprise and

365
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:52,700
we know we're tracking is implemented so
simple that Tesla Motors injury comp use

366
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:00,470
the hashCode hartness nurture and
compare we know if I want so to

367
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:08,689
determine whether he is passing
certificate in or something and ok this

368
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:17,150
is called decoding hex is not on duties
and something about 10 to high since

369
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,300
these trends we've basically for
encoding anything is much more secure

370
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:30,260
and robust more tries to the co every
base 64 live streams for phone in her

371
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:39,980
native version number and choice in
Khost some things that base 64 and I

372
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:47,780
don't know maybe he tries to prevent
from getting into the city streets

373
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:58,140
directory and these are very interested
coal and i truly develops in earlier

374
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:04,250
version of change or you can sign the
developers encoded these were into a

375
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:12,090
paste this were into a paste city of
course but don't want about whatever

376
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:20,130
knows that somebody like him or try to
call every basis if I should say so

377
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:31,710
you're fine diamonds to die in the
fighting in Gaza was called

378
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,910
interpersonal funky house and I was
already in discussions to you don't need

379
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:47,420
to install python 2172 grande que
remembers a report about someone cannot

380
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:54,320
do not copy and past interpol into a
career response centers are not still be

381
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,810
so they will be taxi was somewhat any
questions

382
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:10,630
mhm comes out first before reporting the
findings conclusions about half the

383
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:16,320
stand ready to order 10 tacos cuties so
you need to come in

384
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,680
of your idea so be prepared with a proof
of concept so even if people are curious

385
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,500
bystanders some people don't really know
interest of cooties so you need to be

386
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,780
patient and try to understand we'll grab
every possibility as deep as he can

387
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:40,040
so the most interesting things you have
thought maybe the most dangerous to Cody

388
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:48,770
hosts many men so if you buy any
interest in attack doctor is not

389
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:54,440
currently supported by end of us who
walked to implement your victory and

390
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:00,480
robust more and longer method analysis
and probably find some amazing result

391
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:10,620
some mistakes are the main again against
it and notify the good of all abilities

392
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,190
that thank you
