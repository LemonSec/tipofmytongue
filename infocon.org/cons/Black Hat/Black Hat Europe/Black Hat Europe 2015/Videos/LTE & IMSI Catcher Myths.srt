1
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,500
hello

2
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:39,200
good morning to everybody so we are so I
think I could start so thanks for being

3
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,060
brave coming at nine o'clock I mean
everybody's awake so we're talking about

4
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,570
LT and insecurity admits so my name is
very good book ok so this is a tough out

5
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,700
of shape so we talked before the joint
work with two of our professors who is a

6
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:00,349
smoker who is sitting here and 13 near
me and John period secrets from million

7
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,120
so to workers are from University of
alternative Helsinki I work I worked

8
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,750
there and this he looks fun to do you
believe along with Professor John

9
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,590
preserve and I'm senior research I'm a
postdoc researcher and his appeal this

10
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,880
route which is doing right now btw so
what we gonna go in this attack in this

11
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,469
talk some attacks on the 4G phones so
here we go what what are the fact mister

12
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,750
Shenzhen GSM 3G what we know about how
their works in 2d 3d I'm not gonna go

13
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,530
into detail just to give a brief idea
how things work there and how what are

14
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,549
the things which are fixing 4G or LTE
networks I tried to use alt more

15
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:47,110
affordable than 4G so things are fixing
faulty security to counteract those big

16
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:55,030
Mr Shin attacks and then how we build an
infrastructure which has multiple

17
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,270
multipurpose use so they can taste
different phones maybe you can have a

18
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,650
floating platform and what we discovered
during the test what kind of liberties

19
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,659
were discovered so there are two classes
of my liberty will discover when is the

20
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,080
specification issues and when is the
implementation issues in the baseband

21
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,200
chipsets which allows to work in
securities laws we cover also the

22
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,310
technique where the way we will we will
fall semester

23
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,860
TV stations and we're gonna show some
demos unfortunately we are in the room

24
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,520
so the ranges here good but there are
some issues with signals what we

25
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,070
received but we try to be tried to get
them to work so let's see how it works

26
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,380
and then we gonna talk about the impact
and what what the issue is actually what

27
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,159
things are fixed so far and what things
hasn't fixed in the

28
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,529
the white going details so let me just
you the motivation the way we start this

29
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,959
work or what was the intention willing
this platform first is the baseband

30
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:56,569
soviet so this is something which
started last two years back where many

31
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,349
people believe that with the best band
has a capability to enable some

32
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,480
functionality by themself so I can sense
the message and something can we are you

33
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,600
on your baseband and they can talk to
third parties this is what exactly does

34
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,089
but but is it really possible that
benjamin has control over the whole

35
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:22,579
access access control Alexis processor
processor and there is one thing I don't

36
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:28,109
know you guys not so if you make an
emergency call what happens when you add

37
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,519
GPS is off in some cases your GPS turns
on automatically when you saw some blood

38
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,410
pressure because you are in an emergency
and they should know exactly where you

39
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,100
are and coordinates help you or in some
cases operator can send us a message

40
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,209
asking your location so those are
different message of course they have a

41
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,459
tenth edition they have security there
but it doesn't use your GPS coordinates

42
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:52,089
when it is turned off and that's
interesting right so how how the best

43
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,279
brand campaign or dubious itself to send
the message and that ok that's

44
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,699
interesting so maybe there are some
cases are not where we can try to enable

45
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,079
GPS UN the user has turned it off so I
mean of course you need to turn on

46
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,170
physically right with a buddy and what
might happen and then we want to we

47
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,290
started to look at all those messages ok
what are those messages how they are

48
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:17,259
authenticated also into the 3G frankly
as possible so we have a protocol in 2d

49
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,180
and 3d call rflp intrigue you there are
different versions actually can easily

50
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,380
ask any phone which is going to go to do
that hey give me your location

51
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,970
coordinate and it goes use your GPS
that's why we are easy to do things are

52
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,410
fixed in 3d which do not work at all for
LTE 483 started to get more into the

53
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,379
documents ok what are those messages how
we can enable because we don't have a

54
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,529
platform that so it just went on finding
those digging information and then we

55
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,740
came along this so far finding those
bodies which were which were different

56
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,360
than 7.2 aboard the restart races to
building

57
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,910
platform where we can test LTE phone so
there are many platforms to first to

58
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,870
default 3G phones but there are still
software is not available as it is but

59
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,760
you can modify some somewhat similar
level software to test the 3G phones but

60
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,510
DSM everybody knows we have open we did
reopen be a serious look on software so

61
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,079
we can try and force the phone

62
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,019
many people have tried that they can
crash the world with US Ambassador can

63
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:16,880
decide the phone

64
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,959
many things you could try with the
physical and there was a time when you

65
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,430
will never get it for any there was
nothing and so this is our effort to

66
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,010
build something that we can taste
different 4G for their implementations

67
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,089
can figure out how we can compromise
those phones or or or the liberties and

68
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,670
the last point is again we are coming in
there somewhere we we know that the

69
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,699
attacking costs like building this kind
of platform which cost summer at all

70
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,170
1250 07 dollar goes around 1400 and find
something I don't know this is the cost

71
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,250
of hardware to to make those attacks
which has been going lower lower and

72
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,630
lower day by day at the same time what
are the security measures has been

73
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,790
designed onto those protocols long time
back like 15 years and there are some

74
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,290
missing features I wouldn't say missing
feature with some unique features which

75
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,760
are coming into every generation as it
is so nobly

76
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,029
efforts billet unwanted features that on
every phone which art which I never use

77
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,720
from last 15 years and somebody could
exploit those meters as it is so this is

78
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,040
a commission which has which has been
sold so this might be helpful the

79
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,899
pricing guys that there to take those
attack seriously especially the attacks

80
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,320
so this business divisions with the
steady against we had initially pushed

81
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,360
to prove that this is the case so this
talk is about mostly 40 so we're not

82
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,810
gonna talk about to GTG phones that also
forty architectures and how how do we

83
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:45,339
will Ltd attacks so we did you know that
if you look at your phone and you gonna

84
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:51,079
go my network setting very few phone has
this picture quality only I guess some

85
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,109
Chinese food shows this'll be future not
your Samsung phone or some other phones

86
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,899
so this which is good because if you
were found guilty only and if you have

87
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:00,960
somewhere near

88
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,090
and freedom seekers did not work at all
because they don't condone radio they

89
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,100
can only do so you will go out of
service but they will not attached to

90
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,730
their 2013 GMC Kasia so this is the case
where you touched the phone with LT only

91
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,770
and that that's what we show when you're
fully that actually only so what kind of

92
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,689
attack you could do to to get your power
through to get your private information

93
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,630
if you look at the brochure of Defense
Secretary can google and can figure out

94
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,620
everybody claims that ok there were food
insecure it we can gather that I can

95
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,590
gather them seeing all those things but
this is not the case because they

96
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,650
usually don't greet you and the correct
information what they can only good when

97
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,810
you put your phone on lt1 leader they
can only get the ANC because even the

98
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,650
IMEI will not be given because this has
given the prediction in LTE systems so

99
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:54,060
these are the cases and install we will
talk about will talk about only alt when

100
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,420
your phone is on LT only so let's go
before giving some interaction with a

101
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,569
fake mr. Sheen's what exactly or what
what they were their goal is so true

102
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,240
purpose for the first is as I said to
collect the information which is the

103
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,740
IMSI which is unique number which is on
your SIM card which recognize you that

104
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,150
this is Mrs belongs to you I mean I
which is the unique number of your

105
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,240
mobile phone which you can also see
which can change at all ok there are

106
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
ways to change but this is illegal to
change those numbers and his location

107
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,350
tracking and there are different matters
of location tracking they can also ask

108
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,480
you a GPS coordinates or the surrounding
base station coordinates and you can use

109
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,470
the Google Maps to see where you are or
are there are some special direction

110
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,940
finder antennas those guys used to
exactly pinpoint where you are so they

111
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,840
have ended their see exactly where the
guys but how to find the directions that

112
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,830
they have bigger and bigger antenna
attached to the car which exactly finds

113
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,740
ok this guidance direction so that the
methods they use and also the second

114
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,130
part is calling it an interception which
is not the focus of this talk so we

115
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,689
gonna not gonna talk about the second
wear them securely attached to you and

116
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,170
they try to snoop on your calls or
intercept so they wiretapped all

117
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,240
outgoing or incoming call and sms so
what we gonna focus only on the first

118
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,560
part of this is about protecting their
top three in GSM what we know

119
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,040
everybody has known or if they have
proved that the problem with the GSM

120
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,110
networks or 3G network so 3G networks
are partially security because they have

121
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,230
a mutual authentication is not that easy
that ok fewer femtocell which is the

122
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,230
small which is the small base station if
it's a 3G than actually can bypass

123
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,400
anything that has been has been proved
by already celebrating successes catch

124
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,720
us again to this Kali Kali games against
you as I was using a victory station

125
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,589
just to avoid so on the production side
how do you take that if there is

126
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,580
insecurity alright so this is the
different parts there are some tools to

127
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,370
detect them secures the one famous is
one that has a firewall investment

128
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,630
firewall which can detect suspicious
activity which are going on last year

129
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,589
black Adamus we also released a tool
called the shock so this week is this

130
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,040
works for only Infineon baseband
unfortunately that time it was only

131
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,000
available this one then the slopes these
guys they modified to our tool to work

132
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,210
on it so it works on a large lot of love
for mobile phone-based so this this

133
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,850
tools try to detect ok there is a fake
mustache and destroyed what hatcher

134
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,089
collect information and can can give you
a little bit but for normal users why I

135
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:30,940
said it's a difficult for normal users
all these tools works if your device is

136
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,470
rooted if the US is not rooted both
tools will not work so this is not a

137
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,160
normal application which can install
from Android 231 other application call

138
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,780
and let him see cattles something I
guess you might have heard actually the

139
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,970
problem with these two with those tools
is that they can collect the baseband at

140
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,360
our basement law which is important this
is that all the time which is important

141
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,530
to protect him signature so you can't
believe such as you can be like me can't

142
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,230
rely on Google API said you this
information because those information

143
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,290
can be spooked easily but what
information comes from the baseband

144
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,319
message union information was coming
from the base station and this is this

145
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,920
is this information is difficult to get
from an Android app are you when can you

146
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,470
can't get any average used at us it's
about the API limitations of Android

147
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:18,400
which one and why don't I always you can
get the data so we are coming in at one

148
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
stage little bit where implications are
getting more and more than so they have

149
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,909
a different techniques how the whole day

150
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,230
look so this was the one case was
released or some media articles by about

151
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,130
their techniques I want people who wants
relocation tracking techniques so you

152
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,410
see there is a plane actually the plane
is the pics wings handsome directional

153
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,220
antenna which which can focus on the
crowd from atop the first case or second

154
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,860
case can be heard targets to collect
which the user has to target the knows

155
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,780
the guy phone number for example and
don't know they have to find this guy in

156
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,750
the cold so there are some techniques
they can bring that thing the guy and

157
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,140
they can try to find out where he reads
the turntable the normal the guys know

158
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,160
they are defined exactly the location so
they say the plane was gonna they're

159
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,580
getting the signal strength and location
so it's a wayward the signal strength

160
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,899
means there are some cases where they
recognize the phone to send some reports

161
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,730
it's called measurement reports and they
can be used to collect the surrounding

162
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,610
PlayStation tower for example this guy
on the third picture you see he's

163
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,740
standing here the surrounding the army
with your food base stations what this

164
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,240
plane tried to do was try to collect the
surrounding mister shins and try to

165
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,570
pinpoint where the guys standing or the
location if he's phone supports GPS

166
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,240
coordinates of his own future treaty so
they can also get the deepest corners of

167
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,230
this guy exactly standing in the crowd
and this is pushing for something and

168
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,380
the controller was sitting in the room
he can get the information from the

169
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,890
plane right away hey this guy is here
and they can send the policeman ok these

170
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,320
guys exactly on this position just go
and try to catch him like they are

171
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,379
getting pretty romance with those
techniques right so bad why this works

172
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,910
in 2d and 3d and why we're trying to say
these are the mid cities for the 4G and

173
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,420
what things has been 600 GSM everybody
knows that it's Laxmi Laxmi puja lot

174
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,100
integration between physician and
mobiles so this is known floor from long

175
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,290
time that's what that's what most of the
institutional work they can intercept

176
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,710
your calls as long as they have a
back-end support two systems supports

177
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,240
voice or cause we can use of iPod can do
the same methods to support back in

178
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,100
Colonie can intercept all the calls in
DSM right in 3d it has been fixed so

179
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,449
it's barely you find his insecurities of
weeks which works by itself it means

180
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,160
that without downloading onto the
network there are two cells which can

181
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,330
act like that but you need a back-end
support to support those calls

182
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,669
so maybe some supporters sunlight for
the backbone network and then you need

183
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,600
to have active support from some
operator basically so if you if you see

184
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,620
that somebody selling those kind of
solutions we definitely have agreement

185
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,010
with an operator to support those calls
so in so there isn'ta good production

186
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,780
like an alt also in treaty that it will
or every message will not work as in DSM

187
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,190
and basically everybody watching the dog
attacks the problem with GSM 3G and also

188
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,340
in LT are you guys might have noticed if
you just see the protocol outings works

189
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,620
the total control is always to the base
station Bay station besides the way he

190
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,909
wants to talk if your phone says okay
you don't support this algorithm you

191
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,380
don't support indication I'm not gonna
talk to you this doesn't happen the

192
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,220
power is always given to the base
station he decides what color domestic

193
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,100
use water them as not to use how we
should communicate or not so this is the

194
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,209
weight system has been designed the more
powers to the base station the way you

195
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,980
define it

196
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,890
the phone will act according to that
there is no note capability for the

197
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:44,200
mobile phone and other problem is simply
an IMEI which is you were identified

198
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,040
this belongs to you so employees find em
C you can't read that whether you are

199
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,120
there or not but this is the single
identity with state party within your

200
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,800
SIM card so you move anywhere and if you
look at this rate I was still there this

201
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,899
is the you this is the right guy you
less IMEI this also gives them into

202
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,320
because every time even if I recorded I
can just go on database which is

203
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,830
available on the online database and I
can just put them see the i MiEV there

204
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,550
and I can see whether you're using and
Galaxy S 4G galaxy s4 and once I know

205
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,760
that this guy's using for example iPhone
so I know he's eyeing the iPad then I

206
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,210
can easily say that this was a bad guy
because he has iPhone so I can correlate

207
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,520
with those things to see this is the
right guy to this things works into Asia

208
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,340
India India cement easy as it is so this
is about the background background with

209
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,480
2d and 3d no let's come back to Lt what
has been fixing LT was the architecture

210
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,720
for the LT and other things has been
gotten food so slowly slowly we have a

211
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,850
large LT their base now you when we are
surprised now we're testing last two

212
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,159
days here for the tax and actually is
quite wide coalition LTE networks and

213
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,230
itself in Amsterdam so most of those big
cities has been covered with LT know so

214
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,510
you are you get even in the buildings to
get coverage with AT&T support for the

215
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,330
way so it is not available yet so it's
quite kind of limited so most of the

216
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,990
times you you get a call when you're
really know basically you fall back to

217
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,920
TV and you get a call from ontario
Premier Support twice already call yet

218
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,880
so which in which you say what you see
in the future of course it is I P I

219
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,440
speed data connection that's what
everybody tried to be an israeli with it

220
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,590
did you just have a monthly subscription
and you get unlimited data and I and we

221
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,030
will come back to it talk about how how
this can be a bad picture for example I

222
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,540
can expect high speed data then we have
a more secure than previously envisioned

223
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,649
because it has been designed such a way
that they tried to solve the problems

224
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,880
what they had in 2d and 3d how they can
fix it fix the protocols all those

225
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,760
things on the best effort well wide
previous mistakes so what I why I said

226
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,040
best effort because they can't change
everything because the base system has

227
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,090
been designed so you can't really design
something unique and security are to

228
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,780
have a fallback to support the Fall
Break legal system to work everything so

229
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,970
you can't say okay Netherlands solace
architectures all the operational and

230
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,730
how a new mechanism would work if the
data guy goes to some other country his

231
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,670
plan will not work because they don't
support that networks it's a fallback

232
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,970
support system to give support to the
older generation so they have a best

233
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,220
effort how they can improve their
mistakes so let's talk about

234
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,460
architecture which which we try to show
them anymore so that's what I just use

235
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,020
significance of that occupation what we
having the demo so you just call using

236
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:31,550
equipment so these are the LT terms for
the base station which is called in or

237
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,580
be that's also technical term with the
Treaty of asunción in DSM will call as

238
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:42,460
pretty as trillion called wittiest will
be stationed on the right side of this

239
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,840
is the part which is on the radio link
which is always you see like in building

240
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,949
you see the tower done your homework on
this is only part of you have a visible

241
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,590
from here the connection goes back into
the core network so this is the part of

242
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,919
Cornell Cooperative which is closely
garden so you don't see are you don't

243
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,490
have a direct access to this part of
their comes to me which is the key

244
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,460
management entity which attached to the
fullest support which gives all the

245
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,010
needed parameters to support your cause
a time as this is equivalent to RNC if I

246
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,650
say but this has been fixed into the
part of an ordeal so I mean so intrusion

247
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,730
forty there is a difference between the
way has been put the regulatory control

248
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,240
and direction goes to internet just to
show you but there are many other

249
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,320
companies in the core network which I
will I'm not gonna talk about so what we

250
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,820
gonna come in here so we will have our
own base station which is here then we

251
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,500
have a mobile phone and drug to kind of
protocols which caused when it's called

252
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,590
a test which is accessed written
protocols so they are different kind of

253
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,720
security level so what the tax people
not sure it's about the access network

254
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,070
security protocols and those are comes
on this interface colleges and we're not

255
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,960
going to talk about the connection
between your phone and which plants in

256
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,430
the enemies of this is a different task
which is required

257
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,690
very very your calls are getting into
getting encrypted so and this this talk

258
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:12,520
is mostly so now pitching in LT and how
pitching has been done so on top will

259
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,210
continue with it we'll tell we'll tell
pitching wins now we saw the phone and

260
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,980
PlayStation what happens if somebody
calls you or when you make a call how

261
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:28,820
things happen on the on the radio link
layer of the paging happen

262
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:57,250
and somebody's trying to call you and so
the enemy received message during the

263
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,700
repair some somebody's trying to call
and it creates a paging message the next

264
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,840
led Alec speculate what dispatching
message really consists of the paging

265
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,189
message actually sent to the base
stations and the base stations finally

266
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,850
delivered to the the the point the point
igniters whether it contains it belongs

267
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:25,580
to its own and then according to add it
responds like there is a procedure like

268
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,610
the radio connection to the procedure
that happens and security setup and

269
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,178
after that your messages exchanged with
the phone and the base station so

270
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,690
finding message actually consists of
DMC's so those are called temporary

271
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:49,710
identify us or they can also contain in
see sometimes rarely gets here we'll

272
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,500
talk about like what happens when when
the basic message actually consists of

273
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,000
Dempsey's to the incoming call and the
InnoDB creates the paging message and

274
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,279
delivers it to the phones yeah we want
to show what's the difference between

275
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,399
the paging that happened in GSM 3G and
the paging that's happening in LT

276
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,529
there's a little bit different and
before that I give a little bit

277
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:19,399
exploration about what is network
architecture planning let's say a

278
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:23,418
complete city is divided into multiple
tracking areas and tracking areas are

279
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:28,070
further divided into sense those are
kind of micro sense or smaller than

280
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:36,210
regular GSM macro sense so in in DSM but
seven there was an incoming call the

281
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,639
paging the best I mean the network
actually sends paging message to all the

282
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:41,969
base stations in distracting

283
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:48,290
so all the base stations based send the
paging message and all all the cells

284
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,310
actually receive many forms received the
Beijing message so this is kind of

285
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,970
actually wasting resources so what the
change in LT was it's called a smart

286
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,920
Beijing so the network actually page the
page messages sent from the base station

287
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,470
where the phone was last seen or last
attached to the basic messages sent if

288
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,400
there is no response within three
seconds so then the paging messages are

289
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,640
sent to attract media so this is just to
save some resources on the network site

290
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,040
will show you like how this kind of
smart paging method actually help in

291
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:30,770
tracking somebody so let me send the
basic message to complete area let

292
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:36,410
somebody is sitting in cell one and
sniffing so he'll be able to receive the

293
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,160
paging message but what what can you
infer from that you can only infer that

294
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,080
the guy is present in this complete
tracking area lets the paging sent only

295
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,210
due to the one cell somebody sniffing in
that cell and they can actually in

296
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,400
further ok since the paging message is
being sent only this so the guys in this

297
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:04,740
from then they can actually go put the
tracking yeah we want to show like what

298
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,050
what's changed in LT with respect to
particularly with respect to FIG base

299
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,560
stations so there is mutual
authentication between base stations and

300
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:21,330
phones so both has to successfully
passed out indication procedure step and

301
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,199
then there is managing integrated
integrity protection for all messages

302
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,450
there are certain messages that don't
meet integrity protection and we'll show

303
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:34,250
you what are those and there is one big
change was IMEI is not going to be sent

304
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:40,300
out by the UE unless the four unless the
network integrity protected message so

305
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,950
it's like some request has to come from
an authenticated based Asian only then

306
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:52,980
the poor response the IMEI and yeah
there is little bit different in

307
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,200
building an insecure

308
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,130
demand led the difference was like I
mean if you take the base stations in

309
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,590
DSM simple technique was like you put up
their devices and you transmit with

310
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,090
higher power and then the phones will
actually connect with the basic defect

311
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,439
base station but this doesn't work
straight ahead in LT there's literally

312
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,019
change the change was like let's say the
phone is having very good signal

313
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,840
strength if you see all the full baths
are high

314
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,899
it means that the phone at the phone
doesn't even monitor surrounding cells

315
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:31,090
so it's not really checking other
frequencies or something so even if an

316
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,939
attacker comes with a big base station
this one doesn't even camp on his third

317
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:43,720
base station but I thought on this we
found a technique that's called exploit

318
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,710
some high-powered the frequencies that
are mentioned in the system information

319
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:54,960
messages so the purpose of this hybrid
deployment is that the phone has to

320
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,769
periodically monitored this high-powered
efficiencies periodically so let's get

321
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:04,169
some of that I came to know that these
are the Hypertext acquaintances and it's

322
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,559
a double space station and then we can
actually grab the phone to camp on the

323
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,250
space station so that's how we do it

324
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:20,580
yeah so while working studying abroad
Ltd like we found several implementation

325
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,830
plus this occasion flaws and so we will
show you all of those and so the

326
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:34,720
specification will enable this will be
explained radar he has been killed but

327
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,490
now we go about ok what kind of classes
of Liberty be found and what does it

328
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,669
mean in what it impacts to everybody so
there are two classes are saying first

329
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:47,889
class is about specification of
Liberty's to specifications means

330
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:55,439
there's a organization called tgp from
the European its adoption agency who

331
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,519
designs the protocol stack like to use
SIM GSM 3G and 4G to design the

332
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,840
protocols how they should be working how
they should behave and all the baseband

333
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,590
vendors to implement everything into the
baseband chipset fiscal baseband

334
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,230
the source code for that same side of
the networks ideals implement the same

335
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,360
kind of mechanism so everyone can talk
to each other as per the standard so and

336
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,610
they doing in such a way that the type
of contract alternates alternates how it

337
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,840
authentic signing differential happen so
this is about those standards and while

338
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,220
studying those standards will figure out
that one of the issues that what can

339
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,150
that can be exploited for 4G networks so
your phone is only 40 so what goes wrong

340
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,450
on this category

341
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,390
the first thing I was broadcast
information so what we gonna talk about

342
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,230
here is roc protocol which is used to
set up and manage your over the radio

343
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,840
corrected it means the moment you turn
on the phone and moment or the time it

344
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,760
takes to attach the water of messages
you access to this is this protocol is

345
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,129
this which is called La Russa protocol
to first class is not really well

346
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,179
liberty but it's like the way system has
been designed and that's what actually

347
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:06,980
makes your information which is called
broadcast information and it's not

348
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,570
really floor whenever anybody says the
way system design and this should work

349
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,700
in this fashion because the best effort
was to allow you anymore bye to connect

350
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,630
in terms of a failure to communicate or
failure case and worker's information he

351
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,380
has explained the paging it means that
if you get to call you would identify

352
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,990
diesel within the striking area the
complete tracking area or in the sale

353
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,299
sold like best action since message
where this guy is these guys getting a

354
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:36,080
call and this information later
broadcasted superior to you can see you

355
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,408
gonna see this information at any time
and this information contains

356
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,029
network information which is called
system system information block messages

357
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:47,950
which contains which is which are used
to build a new signature if you know

358
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,250
anybody catcher what he does he's just
kinda surrounding information and the

359
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,429
surrounding information with this is the
broadcast information to this gives the

360
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,190
attacker to set up the critical
information to say that the base station

361
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,899
so that he can force the guy or for the
target or test is insecure and plus

362
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,620
these messages are not as indicator
encrypted and this is the way they can

363
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,118
get your information they try to camp on
it so I'm not going to say this is the

364
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,970
one Liberty sure anything but this is
the way I just tried to exploit most of

365
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,138
the things on the first point the second
is this is the new

366
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,109
discovery which we did that while
reading all the senate messages we

367
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:29,250
figure out that there was one document
continued PTSD 6381 ok if you are into

368
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,210
standard so you know so so this kind of
standards are not easy to understand it

369
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,049
will buy buy buy the guy who you are
working on IP protocol are different

370
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:40,359
vertical stack so this is not easy to
understand if you are not into the telco

371
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,449
domain so this is just a reference to
the document and there is when facing

372
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,739
this report which is about

373
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,729
report so what does it contain so this
desire reports use for the hand over 200

374
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,000
means like you're in the train and
you're telling time saddam airport so

375
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,130
you gonna changed restorations maybe
three four times depending on the

376
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,059
network architecture and while you
camping from West mission to the station

377
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,450
and during the call to handle happens
but you don't notice anything right so

378
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,019
good in the hand or mobile mobile phone

379
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,509
clear those measurement people sent back
to the to the network saying that these

380
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,650
are the measurement reports my signal
strength and everything and that is used

381
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,359
to decide the next PlayStation
automatically this happens but instead

382
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:23,859
you don't feel any delay and these are
the reports needed to get those kind of

383
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:29,880
information we forget as those other
messages are not those are the request

384
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,650
by the best decision is not integrated
and the reports which are strange

385
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,569
weather for nothing compared to what
does it mean something really simple

386
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:40,788
right but this report contains
information which can be identified

387
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:45,660
which can be used to identify your
location so this is just to give a base

388
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,399
station which is the biggest action just
sent you one single message saying that

389
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,740
I don't see the connection
reconstruction and Uma Thurman report

390
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,490
profile phone doesn't verify this is the
right guy or a bad guy he just collect

391
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,269
information and sent back to send back
to the attacker

392
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:04,019
estimate report and this measurement
report contains two types of information

393
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,410
which can be used to identify your
location

394
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,950
the first part is about the surrounding
Michael cylinder signal strength for

395
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,680
example right now my phone is here and
what kind of signal strength I received

396
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,490
from three different businesses are four
basic issues surrounding the area can be

397
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,258
used to identify my my location this is
called trial version better which is

398
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:24,910
which is used by UN for the emergency
services for example if you called

399
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,549
images with this fiery like 112 they can
get your looks in congress also based on

400
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:31,470
the surrounding power switch your
phone's user

401
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,740
in working with him to call so this is
the same technique used by the emergency

402
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,069
agencies to identify you and now any any
guy who has a big question can also at

403
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,460
this information to identify you in the
same area now the only problem is that

404
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,480
these attacks are local so what we
limited so far so if you have proper

405
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,710
ending this attack on this message can
be sent from two kilometre distance so

406
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,520
we can identify the target precise
location which has a better accuracy of

407
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,690
pain at 20 to 50 meters coordinator at
the same time this measurement report

408
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,560
can also give you look at Incarnate like
a GPS use the GPS coordinates so I don't

409
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,779
have any transmission method using
precise information whether Tiger tees

410
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,660
within the two kilometre area so this
was the first the second is in class of

411
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,170
specification will ever do we heard
about this protocol which is used to use

412
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:28,599
for controlling year Mobile's network
how you move around the networks so this

413
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,530
is there is one procedure car tracking
area update procedure for example when

414
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,690
you are moving from this area you been
to this area

415
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,180
your phone as soon as you come to label
the area or the base station which is in

416
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,319
that area

417
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,510
try to update your location like saying
tracking area update and and less to

418
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:52,660
trying to do the tracking real good
question since back to the hotel to the

419
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,750
tower saying okay this is my tracking
request I came from this area is where

420
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,030
my coordinators and during this
procedure which is the part in the core

421
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,500
network and UE agrees which kind of
network more it can select right and the

422
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,470
tud message are like a message which
tales that whether you are the right guy

423
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,980
you allowed to camp on this area so this
is the case for example assuming

424
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,869
scenario if you landing in Berlin for
example if your subscription you bought

425
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:22,470
from KPN or tmobile here and you're not
allowed to have a rooming and when you

426
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,000
land there you gonna send destructing
Europe a bit request message to the base

427
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,020
station in Berlin and says hey I wanted
to indicate now and if you don't have a

428
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,599
roaming agreement you gonna get a
tracking message saying that this this

429
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,200
user is illegal he doesn't have a
capability drawn to this kind of music

430
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,379
message but the problem with these
recent messages that those are message

431
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,190
not integrity predicted it means that

432
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,790
both are not really like it never takes
that this tragic message comes from

433
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,259
where real British Norfolk Christian so
if we have a fake base station if

434
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,400
somebody's trying to camp on all mobile
phone we can send this message saying

435
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,510
that you are illegal customer you're
illegal customer you not allowed to go

436
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,040
and a problem we figured out that if you
make the standard US attack on the phone

437
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,450
every 4G phones your phone goes in a
denial of service for 72 hours if you

438
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,348
don't do anything on your poor your
phone will be out of service you will

439
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,329
not notice until and unless you notice
that you're not able to make a call if

440
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,650
you're not a single call if United your
phone goes off like senate this is the

441
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,720
problem with m2m devices where nobody
checks the European device will be

442
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,919
alright in internet will be off for 72
hours so by standard says that are the

443
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,849
problem we figured in the standard
standard says that the time the time to

444
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:38,190
do it will be an active like 48 hours 24
to 48 hours that's that's a too large to

445
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,640
large counter for this and only with her
to recover from these dogs attack like

446
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,160
if you call Customer Care hey my phone
is not working I should recover so they

447
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,399
will say this time the phone there is
only one solution they have to start the

448
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,530
phone or take out the SIM card insert
against only mechanism by the standard

449
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,190
has been proposed to mobile phone will
not be covered by itself until you

450
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:03,700
restart the device or you said the same
so this is where the PCR to specific

451
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,399
celebrities but there are different tax
what we tried with those like with those

452
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,050
taking area

453
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,359
reject messages you can also have the
don't attack so you can force the mobile

454
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,310
phone go to to see and treat you and you
will never notice at all unless you see

455
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,390
that why why from last month I'm not
going on a floating at work because if

456
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,060
you don't restart your phone this
morning gonna be only to Gen 3G networks

457
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:30,328
put over until the stock in order not at
all with the silent attack now

458
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:36,220
suggestion that we will figure stations
but before that let me make it clear

459
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,859
that so all the research what we did
with me stations we had a publication

460
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:45,000
Berlin where the time to sit has been
done so we have a publication where we

461
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,119
have a test environment where we
insecure so we wrote to properly care of

462
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,400
this one now we can also show that
during the demo if somebody has a

463
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,820
problem we tried to configure

464
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,730
such a base station that your normal
service will not stop at all if you have

465
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,200
a concern you can turn off your phone or
put into flight mode if you really want

466
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,470
but you're probably normal service will
not be attached

467
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,910
Human Services also works if you're
really concerned about you can leave the

468
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:18,180
room but everything will work even if
you can make an emergency calls so now I

469
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:45,540
feel you just information about the way
you have a laptop and this is not be so

470
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,759
it's typically a radio so we use it for
reconnected with a USB to the laptop we

471
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,810
have the space station software running
on the laptop we have several phones to

472
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,180
test with we also tried some of the
latest phones to date

473
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,720
ok we should really thank the guys are
open Ltd undecideds Lt guys have done a

474
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,509
good job so because you know the
application from a penalty but this is

475
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,860
not really a sophisticated or complete
you know beyond basic application we

476
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,450
have to really program at little bit
directly to that tax also a sadist LDV

477
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,060
we find some application about passive
scanning and this thing but we really

478
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,200
had to modified things and it doesn't
work straightforward so after having

479
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,750
this set up like we we came to figure
out that ok these are the specification

480
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,120
will abilities and what could we we have
this setup man let's try when we are

481
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,880
trying this kind of things like we
actually found out some implementation

482
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,630
of all abilities in the basement and for
example like from the beginning we were

483
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,390
doing that ima should not be allowed to
sent by the UK unless it's a skin

484
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,859
integrity protected message but what we
found was some of the basement where

485
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,210
actually giving diarrhea and did the
trick for that it doesn't give

486
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,530
straightforward but what we do is let me
send a special reject message do you

487
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,690
reject message with certain cause cause

488
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,650
identity cannot be denied so let's
actually touching the base station and

489
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,240
the base station they'll start a I don't
know your identity and what the phone

490
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,410
does it deletes all its previous
security context and all its previous

491
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,509
temporary identified and then and then
though the base station is capable of

492
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:31,710
asking the MEA on the phone hysterically
gives it so we found out this and the

493
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:37,800
next one was a relief reports a radio
link failure reports these are really

494
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,670
necessary to have it in the
specification but the specification

495
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:48,160
actually mandate security for this
relief reported earlier reports but we

496
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,618
found that some of the basement really
don't implement any security and

497
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:56,960
disaster relief reports actually carry
some critical information for example

498
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,910
measured signal strength which can be
used for locating somebody apparently

499
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:10,399
portis like to actually have a good
coverage coverage map of the operator

500
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,270
like how good other signals inside
buildings or anywhere these help in

501
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:25,730
actually making a good coverage map for
the operators and yeah yeah just tell me

502
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,710
like what what what else do you need if
you have somebody GPS coordinates to

503
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:35,780
locate them so they were playing with
some latest phones and they were

504
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:42,119
actually giving us the latitude and
longitude so we actually don't need any

505
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,260
measurements so we did not have the
latitude and longitude to locate

506
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,460
somebody somebody sitting from two
kilometre distance and is able to

507
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,089
without the user's know how he's able to
get the location coordinate firmament

508
00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:01,109
these reports are not indicated not
encrypted this report can also go into

509
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:08,630
the measurement reports he was talking
in the specification will abilities and

510
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,440
their next was ok this is on the phone
sign on the

511
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,450
now we're actually looking at are
looking on the bright side we found some

512
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,540
network configuration issue that
actually help in tracking so this is a

513
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,140
traced that we know they're like we
talked on the phone we looked at

514
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,910
temporary identified as I know yet

515
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,618
and then we turn off the phone after few
hours again down on the phone and then

516
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:34,470
we thought there was a temporary
identifier assigned so that was the

517
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,290
first one second one third one so we did
the test continuously for three days and

518
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:44,119
previously noted how the temporary
identified by designed to the phone for

519
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,240
its like this pattern and did you find
any randomness in this matter but that

520
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,649
was found in democracy in Berlin and
this was in Finland we also found

521
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:03,640
similar issues in yeah yeah they should
actually change this allows your

522
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,470
tracking somebody very easily so it is
no random dissing that and we don't know

523
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,680
like how many operators use the same
kind of equipment to randomize the team

524
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:22,810
sees this way but you know what are the
different ways to track somebody

525
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:29,089
previously seen silent SMS silent calls
in GSM but now he's going to bed

526
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:33,990
applications Facebook what's up with
everything so we found some issues with

527
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,700
these applications also what we did was
like we took the Facebook application I

528
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,890
think most of us have it we have the
messenger application Android

529
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,410
application or I was installing a phone
so let's say I'm not trained with

530
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,078
somebody and I send them a message

531
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,670
what happens is the message gets
delivered to the paging message to

532
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:59,300
somebody sniffing and actually observe
the paging message but the message is

533
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:05,260
not notified on the phone so an attacker
can continuously Sen 10 to 15 messages

534
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,420
and actually observed badly sniffing the
air interface and observe the team sees

535
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,800
that are coming in the paging message so
let's effort if if you have substandard

536
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,630
15 insist the same the same time since
it can actually confirmed that ok this

537
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,180
guy is in this location and then later
he can actually put up this big base

538
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:25,720
station

539
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,618
then get the precise location using
measurement reports or GPS coordinates

540
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:37,920
we found similar issues in sweden also
believe it or not falling somebody you

541
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,020
send a message

542
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:48,680
ok delivered but there's also paging
message to observe yeah we actually went

543
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:55,490
public with all its attacks on 28th of
October telling that ok let's put this

544
00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:00,700
in this problem and immediately after
two days there was a fix the Facebook

545
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,220
actually close to Sardis for now I mean
this issue actually that there was no

546
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:13,359
acknowledgement to us or something but
this was a nice coincident unnoticed he

547
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:23,700
didn't want you know we go with a tech
demos we actually ate interface

548
00:48:23,700 --> 00:53:45,490
passively and

549
00:53:45,490 --> 00:55:45,540
$3 ideas which we just map on the

550
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:51,590
just use the Google API stations are
there for questions surrounding the

551
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,600
first one you just heard three months or
so these are the TV stations which comes

552
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,259
on the map and the target is here so now
we

553
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,500
we won't apply the formula which may
explain the paper by the way if you

554
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,720
really want to know the fallout of the
metal used a different angle action

555
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,549
method by every businessman has for
example some Circle area it coerced by

556
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:15,370
every base station and if you do other
exact circle of the network recently the

557
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:19,330
area and if you treat two stations in
Rex

558
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:24,279
intersects location of the user and when
I talked to some radio guys experts of

559
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,120
course I'm not really worried that he's
and they say that the accuracy of this

560
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,450
method will be like 20 to 50 meters the
way you find the target target so this

561
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:37,910
is about to attack the phone attached
with the GPS other saying we're not

562
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:44,250
getting a GPS signal and when we make
the GPS GPS coordinates if there is no

563
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,630
GPS signal the mobile phone will not
send any coordinate for that plus the

564
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,890
serious is not available in every form
so this is new feature which was headed

565
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:58,900
by some render some baseband wonder why
the reason is because we have a

566
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,480
self-organizing networks like my more
cell phone network and the location is

567
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,190
kind of important there's this is a new
feature by the standard this feature is

568
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,600
optional not everybody support this
feature so there are very few funds

569
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,819
which support this this feature but
unfortunately there might be some

570
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:19,170
internet m2m modules which will support
this feature because we employ a moral

571
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,820
question is really critical so we can
also have the GPS coordinates from from

572
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,590
that matter for the second is running
short on time so does attack what I just

573
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:32,520
give you before so we can train back to
you because you're forced the guy who's

574
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,320
attached to t-mobile's illegally I can
do we can do this in the environment but

575
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,690
the point with jessica is that as I
already said that we can deny also

576
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,830
misleading we can block the user by
connecting at all so of course he can

577
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,970
decide the phone and can pick you up if
you notice the interesting thing is

578
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,109
about donating the phone 22 Jan 3G and
until you restart the phone or take out

579
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,730
the SIM card or you don't notice your
phone will be forever completely on to

580
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,200
gently network and if I ask question in
the audience last time when you restart

581
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,850
your phone I've I can understand that
even the people haven't decided their

582
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:05,670
phone last last 10 days or even the
fight is definitely

583
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,440
restart your phone until you get the
problem so it is not having an

584
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,000
interesting feature which we tried we
can block your incoming calls for

585
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,170
example you are attached to a 4G
networks so we can send a special

586
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:21,640
message saying that this guy doesn't
support any calls for example doesn't

587
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,730
support the wise calls and messages
stored in the network still rely on

588
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:30,130
restoring the network essentially then
you will be only allow detection if

589
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:35,010
someone is calling you could you not
gonna get peace to help to say that you

590
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:40,329
gotta call something so you will be
blocked by the incoming calls and is not

591
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:43,940
attacks are persistent asthma said that
because the standard rule is like a two

592
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,490
days but we've seen the practice that
nobody implemented properly counter so

593
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:53,319
far remained silent for three days and
it requires too so they are just a few

594
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:57,460
brief summary so we have delivered in
the standard and chipset which allows

595
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:03,700
you to track issues with the social
applications that has been the design of

596
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,730
the problems with the network deployment
of 4G networks that we will figure out

597
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:12,900
and then we implementation specific
attack or even the specification to to

598
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,359
find a location coordinates of the 4G
devices which were not possible before

599
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:21,808
with architecture which are the personal
calendar use this and also the

600
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:25,839
contributions I mean solution I can't
say anything but you can use any form

601
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,170
without battery and SIM card in your
secure

602
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:35,859
has been fixed walkout has been fixed so
we went to public like October 28 before

603
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:39,540
that we inform all the vendors who are
affected you understand russian-born is

604
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,980
that these are the issues so
implementation issues are fixed by every

605
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,960
basement and almost every basement
window was also affected with the

606
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,460
Liberty shoes because they were and they
were different class of attacks which we

607
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,069
also told now which haven't been fixed
so that's what we didn't tell all of

608
00:59:55,069 --> 01:00:00,720
them which other bodies we also give
them presentation they are working on

609
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,819
the fixes there are modifying the
standard now to contract those attacks

610
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:10,130
there are happening if you look at the
standard documents you might see now the

611
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:14,089
latest happenings however when we talk
to the basement windows and they said

612
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:15,000
how you feel

613
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,470
we fix it so but my phone is still well
above my iPhone still looking at data

614
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:27,919
then he said no we we Patchett we
haven't had any of the texts from last

615
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,600
may not a single has been pushing any
update on the field so it has been

616
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,180
passed by the best man rendered they
said we are fine you can go public so I

617
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:44,629
mean we don't want it so hasn't fixed
the problem with our system our systems

618
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:50,130
unfortunately there were no response
from some rest man when I would like to

619
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:55,500
mention because they don't have any
anything she actually got my personal

620
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,030
contacts to find out how do you know
this guy are interested to listen when I

621
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:04,860
would let me know I sent him email and
reply four months no reply when I just

622
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:12,420
mentioned that this was a huge handset
market also within the force also since

623
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,970
I started a new phone

624
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:19,209
chernomyrdin also inform them interest
on their side but their departure

625
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:28,140
anything yesterday you might have heard
that actually conference and was able to

626
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:35,020
compromise so we inform all the tested
which we are but we have seen that there

627
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:39,160
are problems with enemy actually and it
has to be passed to configure something

628
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:44,060
so they might get noticed something that
there is a problem area to fix that

629
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:50,660
eventually will go to the information
and knowledge operators are fixing those

630
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:56,319
issues so that's it from outside and we
still have time for questions why were

631
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:09,400
you so 45 minutes any questions feel
free to ask

632
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:23,670
newest for the meeting for the same 3G
purpose and passion meeting to mention

633
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,580
whatever problems and we also talk about
the things which week which we which may

634
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:32,850
be fixed by the fighting it works so
they consider consider that they have to

635
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:37,330
take those accurate acts like the
perfect position and they thinking that

636
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,980
they should be fixing a paper and
fortunately we don't talk about the

637
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:45,760
long-term but we do something that we
can fix with some agility with the

638
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,760
software-defined networking there are
some ways to fix those were those

639
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:57,620
methods in the next generation systems
data related discuss long time back also

640
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:01,930
there are many before they designed the
phone system they also consider

641
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:07,440
including MCA actually but they told
that effort required to do that or the

642
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,000
fallback mechanism to recover in case
you had failed to authenticate is not

643
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,280
really fresh and and the networks it's
important not security for the record I

644
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,060
would say because this is for user to be
able to connect Nicole that's important

645
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:23,750
other than the Securities has to be
really effective simple backup mechanism

646
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:29,290
to network will work so there are other
ways to do that so we invited effects in

647
01:03:29,290 --> 01:04:01,029
C maybe using different mechanisms
rather than using

648
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:43,989
five to six months so this will never do
still but nothing and fixing about the

649
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:46,939
one everyday issues from the
specification side that will take time

650
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:52,140
because this has to be modifying the
standard then there will be action from

651
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:56,299
the US and russian borders on GSM
handset manufacturers to modify the

652
01:04:56,299 --> 01:04:59,759
basement gather to modified again it
takes time to patch on the phone so

653
01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:04,609
expect the new force might have agendas
and I don't know whether the conference

654
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:18,890
will be supported with the new update or
not that that we don't know

655
01:05:18,890 --> 01:06:18,180
conference lead thanks for your time
