1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,210
good morning everybody to assess the
people coming in

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,230
still I suggest we

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:15,059
could start a welcome to our talk on
IDPs invasion

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,789
and %eh of ipv6 my name as I know

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,720
over there is silent on your son this is
Rafael on tony is a nice some while ago

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,439
we started building a lap

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,109
flaw testing ipv6

8
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:34,640
security in various weights at some
point of a joined us

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,770
to ride to see this on the exact topic

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,780
and we made some 1b thing quite
interesting observation when it comes to

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,850
a sudden elements of ipv6

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,160
namely the extension had us and how they
interact with

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,390
for current security moderates on a
especially when it comes to

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,960
IDPs Sun some detection techniques which
can be

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,010
after the show Stockham went at the
agenda of our talk is quite simple

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,860
are we will give some introduction on
what does extensions had %ah

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,790
how to walk how they interact with
fragmentation

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,330
on wave I'll give some overview of the
lappy built

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,270
and of course who know have some results
on some nice the most

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,970
we assume that most of you are

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,710
to some degree familiar with ipv6 we
find those here on that

22
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,150
I you oh well thats ipv6 s they are

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,310
right now it's not

24
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,710
no longer like oh this will happen at
some day if at all

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,799
hi Lisa numbers from about John

26
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,090
the nice on a Boeing country

27
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,640
are in Belgium we have right now

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,390
about 27 percent %uh views as ipv6
enabled so twenty-some percent of people

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,890
can use ipv6 when expressing

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,149
on the Internet and this mean so this
has been a part

31
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,349
which was delayed for many years there
was a number of

32
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:12,890
say content or services already up to
six and they were there was a number of

33
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,159
carriers transporting it

34
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,969
but so far there was a lack of views are
so which

35
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,099
a has been cured and say last six or 12
months

36
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,829
to some degree even wasa went on his
left the

37
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,629
free months ago there was just one
percent of ipv6 users and then we'll win

38
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:30,019
one

39
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,560
one of the jumped 25 percent so ipv6 is
there are

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,010
ipv6 is there even if you think in your
environment you don't have it

41
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,579
as probably some of you are well when
does counsel happy V six by default

42
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,620
enabled many other operating system so
the same in the interim

43
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,430
so you should expect ipv6 to be present

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,379
either it will be in your organization
of at least some

45
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,389
to some degree like coming from the
internet

46
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,810
%uh to your premise soul

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,639
are talking about

48
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,480
some ipv6 some as you might think well

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,939
it's just some I do we follow along the
address space

50
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,209
actually it isn't it's fundamentally
different

51
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,729
in the wait wats and I weighed what's on
the network layer

52
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,359
and one of the main difference s

53
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:27,540
it's a concept called extension had us
which hath Beene

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,549
within ipv6 from the very beginning
there with the main our C

55
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:34,819
a 24-6 CEO which

56
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,359
kind of marked the beginning of ipv6
specification oh well yeah I once what

57
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,129
went 2-for-6 CS the main one

58
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,370
and that one has a huge section on these
extensions at us and how they walk

59
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,449
and to give you a quick intro on that

60
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:54,370
and ipv6 say that from can be fought
like a like a German trying

61
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,780
of trains in other countries to
obviously but

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,479
some what guns and the number one again
so I might not be clear rum

63
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,680
when the the train leaves the

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
leaves the station that might have
changed and once a train arrive some

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,470
well

66
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,660
so it's composed of

67
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,760
let's say elements and these elements

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,010
actually from a technical perspective
are

69
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,300
had us which are inside ted after all
what s in ipv6 pollack call to Maine had

70
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,639
%ah

71
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
like an most not purport to process a
heads up

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,410
the mean difference on a big difference
now being

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,700
after this one additional had us far
specific purpose us

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,990
can be in sight at which right now or

75
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,260
their hours even assay

76
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,389
eighteen years after the initial
specification of ipv6 there was not much

77
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,090
practical use of teas

78
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,180
extension had us in actual place offices
on a proper to produce

79
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,910
but given they have been there from the
beginning

80
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,229
given they have been there when the
initial specification

81
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,370
every speck is assumed to support those

82
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,180
and every middle box as it's called in I
26 language

83
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,890
the stuff like fire was IDPs proxies

84
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,140
all these elements have to subplot them

85
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,360
there are supporting means

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,190
of us a boil there was a number of

87
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,390
say well known extension had us that's
the one that which can be seen here

88
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,229
some of those will be covered in more
detail later

89
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,050
and next to that that might be new
extension had us

90
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,130
and de- RC 2460

91
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,810
we commands a sudden ought of these

92
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,080
a extension hey does one say on the
packet

93
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,390
and there was a recommendation that
except for one that is stevia

94
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,160
a destination options head of a day
should I call

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
what he wants but it does not

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,389
specify or recommend or whatever %ah
what happens

97
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,590
if those recommendations are not follow
what and

98
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,690
some of you might know in the Internet
there was a

99
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,010
all its principal on old law

100
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,210
the robustness principal apostles

101
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,770
law which me a big fan so of in many
aspects i bowl for when it comes to

102
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,509
networking

103
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,340
and when it comes to real life this
robust as principal essentially said

104
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,060
some

105
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,160
be conservative in what you sent ones
you compose a packet

106
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,300
follow the specifications but be liberal
and look except

107
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,789
one somebody out sent you a peck at well
um

108
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,620
allow some flexibility and now as long
as field might have an idea what this

109
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,729
packet is about

110
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,900
process it I'll

111
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,250
and this are a bus as principal you
might

112
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,389
place at the Roland and when it comes to
all findings

113
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,220
there was an hour see specifying how to
or

114
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,979
say headline on extension had us and
that one

115
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,820
essentially says so well arm

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,810
an intermediary notes foot forward
packets per firm

117
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,990
extension had us and in case this
intermediary Notre does not recognize

118
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,690
send extension had %ah

119
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,740
on it is still some I expected to
process it

120
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,690
so the overall attitude at to what
extensions I does is

121
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,250
well they can be down on one seal

122
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,219
and called on them try to process try to
understand

123
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:47,009
but in general do not discard

124
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,680
anything up that's do your best when it
comes to understanding and processing

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,680
the potential contents of beer if he had
us

126
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,440
so lemme all this on goals so

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,850
the problems problem number one

128
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,800
that out too many things that you can
buy for instance you can buddy

129
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,870
the type you have this let's not just
had that hope I hope Heather

130
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,120
hadn't had that and so on so on about
9x's we had a sub tomorrow

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,940
seventy you can body the size of them

132
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,380
some of them have Citrix highest about

133
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,800
are 16 bytes but some of them can be as
long guess

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,280
2000 bites or even more you can also
order the order

135
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,560
you can have the whole the hope that
this is not so that I can hear that

136
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,850
all you have this national so sad that
hadn't had that and so on so on

137
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,540
you can play with all these things you
can also via the number that the its

138
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,180
had a a Kurtz in its sayin forest us

139
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,930
behalf want this initial officers had
that you can have two 3

140
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,100
while the hitherto three and so on
office early

141
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,280
okay that accommodation that that would
be just one for each one of them

142
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,030
exit from this initial %ah together
which would be just twice but

143
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,230
it's just a recommendation it has been
sold out

144
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,260
most operating systems except excess
ahead to see

145
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,840
in any number of ok Asus in their
previous six

146
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,920
a hit the 10 and

147
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,300
moreover finally you can buddy the
fields in there

148
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,810
some of them like this in as much as
Heather and their hope the hope Heather

149
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,890
have some officials this how the so

150
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,970
in the format of our type length value
so they can

151
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,960
signified divided from had to have it to
sum up

152
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,250
this is sick kind the pics her I'll tame
this something like a function

153
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,030
I'll which has too many variables so you
can buy too many things

154
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,350
and fighting so many things you never
know

155
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,360
what the final outcome will be problem
number two hundred a some

156
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,230
how this all was quite simple I before
adjust their

157
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,420
may head that never before had that and
the Left four

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,810
here it is slightly more complicated
because

159
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,100
will have their fat man apart

160
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,800
and that have multiple pop can consist
of

161
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,089
there I P six men had that flasks some

162
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:17,680
of Lexus ahead this they lost that must
be processed

163
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,009
en route to the cynicism and we also
have an

164
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:24,910
have multiple but the bad weather but
got it off the rest of the head this

165
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,170
thats be processed just from the
antidote

166
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,550
blass of course the lead for Heather
plus

167
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,089
the final payload so what I've had meant

168
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,579
this in it up it was 6 that the gramm
laughing at the party ms cost but

169
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:45,259
I demand a lot it can have one or more
to heathers then we got the truck with

170
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:45,749
Heather

171
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:48,939
what's on takes place

172
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,389
and not at all but for the fact that
they some and find local the fragments

173
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:59,119
of the fragment apart let problem is

174
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:02,929
how the successful hit the south saint
let's take an example here

175
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,360
we'll have a man had a that the six my
head that

176
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,230
who haven't had that this initial to
said that and

177
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,689
this is because the plus payload it is
so heather has a value has a political

178
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:15,410
value

179
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,179
we all know that the local line of hype
before his four or a five-year 6421

180
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:25,059
so forest us they didn't have that has a
little value of 43

181
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,279
that this initial just had a has a
global I love

182
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:33,110
sixty this is because Apple II of 61 on
from there before a

183
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,790
sold its Heather both the main one and
that this will head this one

184
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,360
have a field called next to the Value
field

185
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,490
and this field bullets to the next
Heather in our example

186
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,660
ipv6 Heather has an excuse to get a
value close to forty

187
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,679
because the point here to the Heather
they're looking at is on heather has

188
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,399
admitted at a value close to 60

189
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,949
which Boston it's not just that and so
on this iz

190
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:06,509
how their tent it's a kind of a point
that concept

191
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,959
so far so good nobody I mean that it's
look but is it

192
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,320
so what's the problem with this the
problem comes

193
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,529
when all this chains are fragmented let
second again in exile

194
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,670
let us chill not the fragment apart

195
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,259
is they want a little a slight I have a
business office had a

196
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,860
which points correctly to this is
because ur was critical value 6

197
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,050
and then have that this is the payload
and the attack meant this one

198
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,509
into fragments let us chill not

199
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,610
but Blanc is dust but this initial
together

200
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,040
and part 2 all the time when the party
this is it this is because the

201
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
possibility not have a question

202
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,709
let's all be this netted a value of the
pad look at that in the first fragment

203
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:58,750
I'm under that the national value

204
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,190
little value of this nation absorbs is
sixty and the discipline

205
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,319
is 6 Solis will be here any suggestions

206
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,110
Disney 60 correct

207
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,279
610 absolutely yet so the fact that the
points

208
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,540
for this national discovered now the
seventh hadn't I have here

209
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,670
the disappeared let's this netted about
you should be

210
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:29,630
that this behavior has a political ally
of six is it obvious

211
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,910
in the late eighties on my thing at

212
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,100
should be six but actually but that's
politics did

213
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,860
or that first a mess him up should be
six because

214
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,360
this must points to disobey had a
actually should be sixty

215
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,399
because the Fed look at the stall this
point to the first

216
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,300
sister Heather all the fat man double
but it was go to put

217
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,439
the disputed that but this is not just
one this is a a reminder detailed

218
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:02,199
but s also later will exploit this today
love to have eight

219
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,040
S II and commit cell IDPs device so or
all

220
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,740
are it's a kind of mess there was a huge
variation

221
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,560
of different pots of a potential pack at

222
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,199
all when it comes out to the size so the

223
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,449
to the auto of things contained our of
the

224
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:28,319
options so within the had us and all
this

225
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:32,920
which then again as some of you might
already a

226
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,079
figure poses problems to security
enforcement module its

227
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,550
which I suppose to act on identifying
South

228
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,730
and identifying like boundaries

229
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,980
within packets and contents once you fro
in the

230
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,760
a huge cloudy mass into such a device
said this might

231
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,930
cost some all types of problems
especially because

232
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,639
all these things can combined and any

233
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,470
potential way there are some just very
few restrictions

234
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,790
like the should I want them to can only
be one i hope i hope i doubt that is a

235
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,660
sudden type

236
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,779
and that one has to follow the main had
a meet Italy

237
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,410
but besides that there's pretty much no
restrictions

238
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,870
on how to on a combined a fragment

239
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,680
all the stuff which clearly shows

240
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,720
I'm with you might be familiar with the
lengths I can dish it if

241
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,160
and within lang sec one of the most
basic rules

242
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,500
this whenever you possum thing

243
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,660
a ride a grandma befall

244
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,420
I like girl parsing well which clearly
hasn't happened in the ipv6 pace

245
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,189
which then again on

246
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:50,540
causes problems too much freedom and
flexibility

247
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,240
whatcha say in Washington AP prop also
to security

248
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,610
and can lead to lets a sudden chaos

249
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,010
to get some more practical

250
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,120
what could actually go wrong now figure
up

251
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,050
a dead right now in my lists
environments

252
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,559
security enforcement like to decide if
for a packet is a good all bad one

253
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,649
art should go this direction on a dime
another 10 be no

254
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,790
another out at whateva decision

255
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,230
s taking up on identifying

256
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,089
packet content and

257
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,189
up well then the question comes up well
what if we tried to soften when this

258
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,949
identification what if we try to confuse

259
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,370
security enforcement modules of
different types actually we had a

260
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,400
we did a number of why what tests as
well but the most interesting ones where

261
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,960
the IDPs won some

262
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,600
and the in theory

263
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,880
this type of problems has been discussed
for many years

264
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
but this was just feel we're nowadays so
I'm telling us rhoda

265
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,580
my still which is freely available

266
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,390
call care on and KR on can as you will
see later on

267
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,160
implement all these techniques by simple
command-line

268
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,490
switch it's easy to use on easy to
create packets which have

269
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,600
all these combinations and Laois waz

270
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,959
and it can even be a I'll be used as a
proxy a

271
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,309
a saw you a pro and some mom whatever
type of attack our

272
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,460
a scanning traffic gone like I run that
saw us to run it through care on

273
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,850
and outcomes from care on all the year

274
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,809
all the traffic in heavily my once a
obfuscator

275
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,920
but out put pathway actually we built on

276
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,580
as I said we were the lap this let
consists at

277
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,660
some of of IDPs solutions

278
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,320
a 20 per sauce once snot and so we
caught a

279
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,750
to commercial one side this aside the
tipping point to use this as a society

280
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,860
vice both far

281
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,050
a medium size and %uh pricey vice us

282
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,550
I mean it's not a the the biggest see my
sis you might find in

283
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,020
a corporate environments are still on
the other hand this is not so hot stuff

284
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,830
this is stuff that you can expect the
can reasonably expect to see it then

285
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,670
assay medium sized organizations I even
larger organizations

286
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,650
and those serving us protecting entities

287
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,840
all entities identifying on

288
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,230
the trying to to block the bad network
traffic

289
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,870
overall so far we have fallen to

290
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:39,059
12 different evasion techniques all of
them where r

291
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,730
reported to the respective when does and
all of them were

292
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,990
when you at the time of our us finding
them

293
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,860
then only part that's

294
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,910
some of them were patched some of a paid
member Petro typically

295
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,190
some of them approached move aside and
delay

296
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,690
%uh but actually a in the case as you
will see later and the case of modern

297
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,070
sauce

298
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,440
hi are there was a a while

299
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,570
say interesting way how they act that
upon this Saturday had a kind of

300
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,340
well while we don't have time to take
care of this

301
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,679
a cultural customer support attitude
which is particularly interesting as

302
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,220
some of you might know we have

303
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,740
been given number of black had talks
would be far

304
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,000
especially covering Cisco stuff on
braking system with south and disclosing

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,480
vulnerabilities in Cisco stuff

306
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,910
at a time that what you will always so
good communication

307
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:39,120
I even recall a black hat 2010 when
Antonio's first gay for

308
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,730
its target was to them 11 okay

309
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,390
arm Antonio's South Los show it to the
results of

310
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,750
him analyzing the operating system
behaviour when it comes to fragments and

311
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,350
extension at us and I

312
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,110
and another guy gave a talk on Cisco was
a lie P and that we had in my guy

313
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,520
Francisco peace art

314
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,670
sitting in the room a dallas and
discussing the suffering eliasson

315
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,840
nowadays it seems times have changed to
and that space

316
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,280
anyhow let's have a closer look at the
actual

317
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,510
stuff you left been probably been
waiting for

318
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,640
let's begin with six other

319
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,040
a sorry got us you know it's an open
source project

320
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,940
it has been funded by their US Homeland
Security

321
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,000
I

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,130
during out this sweet right we tested
several this all started with that song

323
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,860
2.2 2.1 it's time we found the
reliability

324
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,590
I use to report it to the developers
they used to

325
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,680
budget the soul than with this the next
version 2.2 2.2

326
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,750
we waited again 2.2 2.3 with it again

327
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,870
and Tarso leptin alcohol

328
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:52,210
setlist I would say six different
division picnics

329
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,920
and are going to the most ain't the
latest on the guest 2.0 .3

330
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,830
this is Kyle they vision looks like

331
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,080
well to use two fragments

332
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,060
first of all I R 40 but was a sweet got
this seller has been stored in a bit of

333
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,760
vitamin

334
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,310
and it is in a passive mode are meaning
that the

335
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,320
Augusta traffic at the course alert but
it doesn't look good

336
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,180
um we used

337
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,950
of course two-part apartment up a
popular my number one

338
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,160
now happen to be part courses of

339
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,460
a type settled in Canada and of course I
make other and the bad weather but the

340
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,950
dust

341
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,250
from this Nationals Heather and flair
for the first fragment to include the

342
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,290
business which has had that

343
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,200
and the so-called lead for credit it's
time for some action I'll

344
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,500
okay

345
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,390
and now we will demonstrate this I was
just sent a simple ping command

346
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,440
ping requests a was siren to our targets

347
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,140
I'm to see a mmm Xi'an

348
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,830
our lock boxer I am

349
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,750
our the simple the alert the showing up
in ipv6 as a request to send

350
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,860
and was shocked to see a crew our
requests and our reply

351
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:19,410
so now let's reset the sink and

352
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,410
now I S send our

353
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,450
Pharma combination missin was shock

354
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,210
a destruct mentor to first fragment and

355
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,660
the completes

356
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,170
message so here we have our outing
header

357
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:42,250
of fragment and the next fragment we see
in the first fragment just a destination

358
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,090
option had a

359
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,490
and and the second fragment I simply and
pay a lot

360
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,910
and as we see mmm n

361
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,320
sorry Carter nothing know a lot is
showing up

362
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,450
ok I could get through but a

363
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,320
so we cudda doesn't notice anything
assets not able to parse

364
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,170
these that the set combination of
fragmentation extension doesn't correct

365
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,530
way

366
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,370
the goal here who wanted to sing later
taken to exploit

367
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,080
so for this purpose here a goes to a
simple SEP 6 aquatic West

368
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,050
when they bled all that detects simple
pink this was a gold

369
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:28,050
percent the simple pink without being
detected

370
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,779
a game I as a set were deported or the
problems

371
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:36,100
and I'll we were impressed actually buy
the speed that the

372
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,029
sorta kinda developer spots all of them
and it'll take the moral

373
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:44,820
awake mother to budget and really is
thing at all this is

374
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,029
the latest or no two points 0.4 which
has fixed the

375
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:53,500
all their abilities that they'll have
discovered and reported third let's look

376
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,360
at the developers

377
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,440
Cape are

378
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,879
now I go to talk probably for the most
sophisticated of the attacks

379
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:06,059
missus used against tipping point arm

380
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,129
again ok left two different cases here
this is the first case

381
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:15,830
we found it but in March of 2014 lets
you look at this fragment apart

382
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,460
a hookah at this next to each other this
event the payload

383
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,200
and this is how we'd

384
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,509
mine it's too late the point the word
first time

385
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:31,080
if you recall this next to the value
from the production should be sixty

386
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,279
we found out that well this one

387
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:39,149
is 6 and the fed's 160 the pic point
does not to get an e-mail alert

388
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:44,009
to keep the ball doesn't block our bike
its so this was a way to leave it to the

389
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:44,519
point

390
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,750
this was bach martz or report this
problem love end of they fixed it

391
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,330
up after the times if I call wirthlin

392
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,350
but again look at the second one

393
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,980
before putting the second one let's see
how this technique works

394
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,370
and what a difference here between six

395
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,000
and 16 okay this iz

396
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,049
it was a output over it but this guy
picnic

397
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,980
the letter here

398
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,570
is actually the TCP packet that the city
had that plus the payload

399
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:24,570
in our example is in the kind of excess
I thought ok

400
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,769
that is the one is that this in as much
as Heather in particular

401
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,979
the yellow circle it's the number fifty

402
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:37,389
number fifty is 32 this model of

403
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:41,799
number eighty what to say HTTP port in
our example

404
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:46,470
or tightly rates discipline and that's a
little Lance a kind of a Suffolk

405
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,489
the problem is that you to their letter
to the value of six

406
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:54,109
both what's happened to the point assume
but

407
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:57,529
the disappeared that is that have
something here it starts

408
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:00,889
over here so aren't is a tough

409
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:04,359
looking for that this IPL art here which
is eighty

410
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,129
it to testify to someone here witnesses
in 100

411
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:11,749
but the 100 S you know he to the smile
it's

412
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:15,179
256 in this month sought

413
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,799
believes that the packets going to this
port 256

414
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,220
it'll put eighty so sickness or

415
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,169
is not a gift asset to report the
problem

416
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,419
the bad old apt it took a lot of us but
but the problem

417
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,190
but again found another way

418
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,090
this is the old technique but the
described

419
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,659
the statement 7 fragment and

420
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,679
when it was botched was at the gala
tonight again will also get the same

421
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,200
technique

422
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,070
at the notice that the first fragment

423
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,070
passes through the device while the
second ones blocked

424
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,379
now what you would do in our case

425
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:02,519
you observe that the past month allows
the first fragment

426
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,029
and the sick ones blocked they said so's

427
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,629
eniac a mindset what could you do for

428
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,629
you notice something get through and
some things blocked

429
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:17,999
sometimes think so more simple than
expect

430
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:21,680
it quite simple actually

431
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,280
you could just send the second fragment
was more so the guy and I'm

432
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,220
it's blocked but the second time it
passes through yeah

433
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,100
okay oh come on as they were here get
them some for action

434
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,490
are to show that team of

435
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,190
I will use Wireshark on my aside it

436
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,340
should be running on its

437
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,440
we're going to so both

438
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,240
that they could listen the defenders
arson got going to see that that I guess

439
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,800
a sense the packets to fragments no one
is blocked

440
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,370
and there's the target this eve just the
two of them

441
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,370
would suddenly enough to get a response
soul

442
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,410
okay so well now I were first sent just

443
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,110
per cent per pack it again to see 'em
what is happening

444
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,600
and PC in my life sock the request to
send its

445
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,770
mmm and I'm here at the lock

446
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,910
%uh of the tipping point and USC okay

447
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,410
one package is blocked so it does suck
just simply block my picket

448
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,840
and I don't see anything there's nothing
nothing comes in here

449
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,380
at let's assume this is Tia I
destination

450
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,150
a system whether picket what the traffic
is destined to

451
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,480
so now I would send a on

452
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,750
of fun combination so you see here

453
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,990
first fragment second fragment why sock
reassemble it

454
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,340
sense now and here we see is a sec
search fragment which is simply is the

455
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,480
second one again

456
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,460
and if you look in the lock and our
first luck was he okay

457
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,000
he blocks 1 and but

458
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,260
if we now switch to our targets and

459
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,470
even though we see it and my wife sock
begotten

460
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,170
reset back

461
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,810
way mind and that we send us and because
so there was nothing listening on on the

462
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,850
target machine on

463
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,060
applied 88 the main point being I

464
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,490
now with the segments try something come
true

465
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,170
well which can be seen here actually
it's a

466
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,470
two packets arriving on the destination
system

467
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,160
I'll which has a sitting behind a
tipping point which is protected by a

468
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,020
tipping point

469
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,060
says something gets raw I'll well in the
end of today I sent back a

470
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,130
reset but the interesting parts are at a
first 21 some

471
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,600
again note he send out rear I

472
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,660
here it's only two showing up it's like
an a while on

473
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,520
makes for your Thunder Down on it's like
the evaluation

474
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,780
not to go in one gets out up but if we
go in

475
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,300
and to get out I and you can see here
again

476
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,480
here is some a fragmentation had out
here assassination options some

477
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,680
and a it's a split into two fragments

478
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,120
which a and contain even the

479
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,410
the payload to you can this heat on Dell
which were sent some

480
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,930
just indicate any type of peyot

481
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,410
get through even thou didst back at
should have been blocked

482
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,040
are by the tipping point device and

483
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,550
actually without those the the safe
handling a round of the packet it was

484
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,170
blocked

485
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,390
it was it's just the same back it s in
the first try

486
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:54,390
but now it's a crafted in a certain way

487
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,269
whole game so

488
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:03,380
are let's come to your sys-con
Sourcefire

489
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,659
and snort I wouldn't hunter between
again but the

490
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,390
before doing so does to miss that the
would expect that the this tool

491
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,980
ID bassist have a quite similar behavior
because says he'll also spotted space is

492
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,399
not

493
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,370
so wouldn't expect any differences but
we found out that sums it up this work

494
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:21,809
Inc

495
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:25,710
and Justin Sourcefire didn't work in his
Lord net thanks I'll

496
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,679
I had Becka a give back to you in a
second term the main

497
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,130
appoint a is here I

498
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:38,080
given I was kind of supervising the lap
I was in was seen in the communication

499
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,260
in all this case s

500
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,789
and some as i sat

501
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:47,970
sweeeeet already in June we contact its
not develop us NP caps we didn't get any

502
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,899
response

503
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,130
we'll report it into sousa sauce fly on
Sept

504
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,429
I actually into different people

505
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:01,799
given beyond was to customize a customer
projects including source file we

506
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,240
a

507
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,820
half a and the we had at the time and
sell half

508
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,090
a certain channels into on

509
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,820
into source file and that lost sir

510
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,150
a quite disappointing experience

511
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,720
they got back to us like a weight or
what is this some

512
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,410
a don't waste our time Wyo contacting us

513
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,150
and some actually days has it

514
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,679
suggested going through Aug customer
support so clearly

515
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,000
at least those parts and we are talking
to or did not realize what this was

516
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,740
about

517
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,929
which was the surprising to say the
least I mean we understand that after

518
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,190
the acquisition of

519
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,650
Asfaw cya bye bye Cisco there's all
types are we all something's going on

520
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,320
and people might be busy but

521
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,040
this again was a interesting

522
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,900
a soul which arm well if our

523
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,450
responsible lawyers say say nowadays
coordinates disclose a fail sir

524
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,690
what is left for ways such a colourful
is close up

525
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,790
which is exactly what we are doing here
in right now

526
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,910
became

527
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,690
are let's Skype I'll live demos for
support I want to test source Hyatt

528
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,480
are it's a late this on its server
device up here

529
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,650
this is a the more though the bus home

530
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,320
and the build are must mention here that
both

531
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,350
snort and Sourcefire have some ipv6
ruled

532
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,390
in and the cordis people so to let the
are not enabled by default

533
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,500
without enabled in a bit them

534
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,660
he visits even more easier

535
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,380
it's really easy to we waited so try to
make it more difficult for us

536
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,610
will try to ayala to enable all their
rules

537
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,210
late with BB 6 S locus of course they
don't get any false alarm because there

538
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,140
are a couple than that that they get
false alarm even fool it is the main

539
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,640
traffic

540
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,240
so enable all this rules you can see
there

541
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,630
single to right this year a would
actually need

542
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,830
do a pretty well good job but still
assume sole the art

543
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,529
ways to evade it

544
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:16,980
soul talking about Sourcefire first
missus

545
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,480
one example how satisfied can be rated
again ok have two fragments

546
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,109
I would combination inevitable part

547
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:29,779
exit from the man had of course we use
the latest in a synopsis had that

548
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:33,819
inevitable part of have just one person
is not just had a

549
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:37,210
the first fragment and another one the
second fragment

550
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:43,490
plus of course level-headed soul out of
funds go to say Carl this combination

551
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,279
could be used

552
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:47,740
believe it so far I am

553
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,950
or 1 percent to this department said
don't want to sold-out

554
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,980
I'll the target this is just a fragment
and

555
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,839
response up to them okay

556
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,069
um now same procedure as s

557
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:07,170
a.m. before I would just just sent the
center

558
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,319
and this time again being a crest and we
see it so up

559
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,579
and my wife stock and if you've

560
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,329
repress the lock of the Sourcefire you
see even your word is shown up in our

561
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:19,819
lock

562
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:26,819
and is blocked so an hour clears a block
again

563
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,350
yes

564
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,650
yes and no I would send our combination

565
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,630
you see here two fragments ping requests

566
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,420
goods through and

567
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,690
we should normally see

568
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,970
take a look at I

569
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,180
the a target says some I mean it didn't
show that

570
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,430
before nothing got through but the you
sought India numb

571
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,570
the a lot being to get I

572
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,010
and now I'll this as the

573
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,260
final destination of the packets again
we see there something I'm

574
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,609
going through on the ice MP packard
which should have been blocked

575
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:19,740
on it on just so

576
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,210
that should have three got to something
are get through a

577
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,600
I reply on that one and looking a bit

578
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,540
close-up numb can be seen there was

579
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,590
again sup Antonis laid out

580
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,300
there was a number of destination had us
which should be dealt say if it was some

581
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,520
production traffic

582
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,980
there was a fragmentation head-on and

583
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,590
this some katzer delaware truck has some

584
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,330
some you some difficulties in correctly

585
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:57,450
say my positing but understanding are
interpreting the packet

586
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,900
but a as you can see a it's a

587
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
it gets reassembled on the final a point
and

588
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:10,900
as processed so I'm llamale without 3
getting anything

589
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,859
just a note here that both to pinpoint
the source file adding lime

590
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,800
so not only this week to get an alert
but this is completely blocked traffic

591
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,810
that is not used to it after that that I
get this more than enough

592
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:28,920
the to sort out the else was fired in
this case the point before

593
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,369
had been rated a cape this was about
Sourcefire

594
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:35,609
surprisingly enough this technique does
not work in this North

595
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:38,690
I suppose because social scientist based
on

596
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:44,880
2.9 points six vessels not the latest
not less honest 2.9 points 6.2

597
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,690
I sold will try to find something for us
not to

598
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,890
a

599
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,150
who used to let this vessel they want
they messin 2.9 points 6.2 again we're

600
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,839
in a booth

601
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,630
all that the six related rules that did
not trigger any kind before salon

602
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,140
and try to rate it arsenault

603
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,619
SC has been distorted over Thomas him
enough as laptop

604
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,780
hard is configured in passive mode soul
who also lives over there

605
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,050
and this is how the technique oxley
works

606
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,170
arm here

607
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,550
arm the interesting thing is that
actually the

608
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,839
this combination with can be more or
less if fully legitimate by Kat

609
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,890
in the previous example hurt treat this
initial officers had that

610
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,890
in that unfathomable part which should
not be the case

611
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,480
according to that issue that should not
much but suit

612
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,589
be just one person is not just get that
had me the part

613
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:48,069
and be used three a kind of wireless and
all

614
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:51,079
would we didn't fall rated accommodation
here

615
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,250
egos an almost fully legitimate packet

616
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,359
will have a hope I hope had a following
directly the men had that

617
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,240
s must does will have everything
together

618
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,170
loose type 3 because type 0 has been
dedicated

619
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,420
and thankfully it's not a good seller
for that

620
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,410
so it was like three aunt

621
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,740
at this and it's not just had that all
of them that had middle part

622
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,380
there have outside with Heather and the
use

623
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,390
another one business altogether is there
outside

624
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,460
in a five minute but lead for in the
payload

625
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,150
I would like to remind you that have
been good at this in this work together

626
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,240
the technical part in the other on the
principle but this religious debate

627
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,260
according to RFC

628
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,730
soul this could be if allegedly May 26
bike at the real world

629
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,900
and these companies will be used live 8

630
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,520
snot K Rafael your am

631
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,859
yep same again with just sent a simple
just simply getting requests

632
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:57,359
seem reply with Cesar allowed in our
lock

633
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,960
above I'm no clear look a little bit so
you see that there's nothing sewing up

634
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,390
and no I won't send

635
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,750
are farmed combination Anna

636
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,069
you see here again fragment one fragment
to

637
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:20,730
a reply and nothing appears in the lock
in a few looking

638
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,829
at are send packets

639
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:27,069
will see here of our powder

640
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:31,020
our outing had a type 3 our destination
option header

641
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,079
and then we come to the fragmentation
fragmentation

642
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,470
a.m. part 1 this is just a destination
option header

643
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,589
and the fragmentation part 2 is again
the ICMP

644
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:45,690
v6 and firms up a lot

645
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,089
am so as ASEAN nothing in the lock

646
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:53,910
reply got back so it will be processed
by DA by a finer

647
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,770
I'll fine point of doing the packet
switches see it which is the main

648
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,529
message

649
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:03,859
on are just by adding had us in a
certain combination

650
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,480
you get through on to define a

651
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,109
a final destination and given postlets

652
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:14,660
principal delivering much except the
pretty much

653
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,630
all operating systems will happily
process so those packets

654
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:23,079
and act upon of them as if they are all

655
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,000
if they were sent without any on the had
us

656
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,289
so obviously this brings up the question
what

657
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:36,460
could be done against the stuff if you
run IDPs system say should expect to all

658
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,480
your suddenly

659
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,720
expect on they the detect

660
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,170
well-known bat stuff which they clearly
as we have shown

661
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,380
don't once across two packets are sent

662
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,490
what could be done and S are we would
like to

663
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,730
differentiate between different parties
and lost in the o.r process

664
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,420
given

665
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,859
we deal with ipv6 a lot

666
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,079
we are aware there was some

667
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,029
actually yes hundreds of our seas
coloring ipv6 in some way

668
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:16,579
some of them and even contradicting each
other

669
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,720
some of them issued by ear interested
parties

670
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,760
are based on certain politics going on
in it. of space

671
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:31,069
still when it comes to the main elements
desi you Chick Corea for ambiguity

672
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:35,920
waiting are a cease and then
implementing stacks up on

673
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,250
to all based on the SRC is it's a
difficult Oscar

674
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,190
for develop our icrc sandy in the main
ones are not always very clear

675
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,220
so there must be a from me think I'm

676
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,240
and again we have their of the way I T a
walk and

677
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,329
the wats and we r up big fans of tear

678
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:00,579
a robust this principle in Genoa IL are
still there was not enough

679
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,930
well that we think guide and saw p.m.
guy dance

680
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,760
when it comes so how to process and how
to actually

681
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,859
I'll built and to act upon packets

682
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:17,680
second when it comes to win dos we had
the impression

683
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,460
thats say quality assurance of security
quality assurance

684
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,700
so there was room for improvement and
when the space

685
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,079
when it comes to ipv6 tools are
available

686
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,450
Tehran can be downloaded at some lease
and

687
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:38,670
number of the capsule XO we got to from
up from some of the year

688
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,210
especially in the week of the space we
got very be imposed if response like a

689
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,770
thanks for a peek at some thanks for the
tool is so we can

690
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,510
a test all this on all all own coen had
okay ron has been released in the first

691
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,540
Russian like nine months ago or so I'll

692
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,690
a though so it's not a

693
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,170
like it's a tool which is sold coming
from the well

694
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:02,510
security and put the quality assurance
and when the space could be a

695
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,340
improved when it comes to say you
organizations

696
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,620
assuming that many of your a

697
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,610
not in Bluffton when the space but then
they're like use that space to some

698
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,200
degree

699
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,820
in corporations all agencies

700
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,610
using the sea y sus I

701
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:26,060
it should be noted that there was a
quite new ROCE

702
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,790
7112 which specifies

703
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,020
that an intermediary system like a 90 PS

704
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,120
like a firewall arm us a call it in now

705
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,870
RC spacer any type of metal box is
potentially allow its

706
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,250
to discard pet cats once

707
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,370
the full had a chain is not included in
the first fragment

708
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,860
which is a good thing ass had a chain

709
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,420
being fragment at aren't being split
into

710
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,490
several fragments we don't see any case
s and we do a lot of ipv6 what we does

711
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,600
we don't see any cases where this should
never happen in production traffic

712
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,160
so allowing metal box s to

713
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,920
you may produce away if you can
recognize the full had a chamber in the

714
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,840
first fragment

715
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,980
is a good idea still are some of our
texts what

716
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,900
would have walked some nevertheless like
a tipping point one

717
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,000
know that would have fought walked even
if

718
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,660
that'd be wise sector at like the IRS
e71

719
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:37,440
at 12 kinda for Laos this is a deviation
from the old mantra like

720
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,960
everything a in extension had %uh space
must be it I'll

721
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,030
fully processed and we got less if it's
recommended or not

722
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:52,930
secondly it when it comes to configuring
security device us

723
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,190
there was two potential approach s a
fast

724
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,550
you might the

725
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,550
say come pick up in their own devices in
a way that they drop

726
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,620
on extension set us which are not need
it

727
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,740
which immediately brings up the question
what da de los on

728
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:14,190
it's pretty much all of them except for
maybe a in case you expect fragment to

729
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,190
traffic which it shouldn't happen but
dark on a case s

730
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,000
I love from tunnel traffic RT in a sec

731
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,960
well fragment that that pickett's may
actually show up

732
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,730
so I'll what we think

733
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,860
what we are not to a full year we have
different opinion TS and Antonis and I

734
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,080
at least I think you should term minutes
it's fairly safe to drop pretty much

735
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,950
anything

736
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,010
all extensions had us I

737
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,440
except for maybe a fragment had a

738
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,530
in case a fragment the traffic and
obviously authentication and to ESPN

739
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,750
trippin security payload

740
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,840
that I had also which I needed for IP
sec so running

741
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,620
VPN traffic fulfill doing you I so then
you would need ot extension had us

742
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:07,590
on but I'm a I usually recommend going
with her

743
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,330
there was free play drop all this crap I

744
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:15,200
at T Atty bought us allied least

745
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,650
in case are you want tonight EPS

746
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,820
to fully function the way you that you
expect at

747
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,230
a traffic has to be sanitized us grow up
before it and SE IDPs

748
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:29,650
I do not expect some that

749
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,690
the on the problem sauna types of
problems and we have seen

750
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,050
can be cured in a short time like it
some

751
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,240
okay can be patched and then once again
the

752
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,720
say several weeks late hour mmm in some
cases just

753
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,460
base later Rafael R

754
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,070
mind telling us all somebody else here
in Tehran

755
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,770
fine finds you techniques I think this
is a kind of unsolvable problem

756
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,120
for IDPs so if IDPs should do

757
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,730
function properly sanitizer traffic
before I

758
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,760
going into it if you ask okay what is
some

759
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,060
was the actor practice out there you
might look at this

760
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,490
default behavior of checkpoint for
example this Saturday a

761
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,660
by default checkpoint drops on extension
had us

762
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,820
which does not include authentication is
peter Watts 5p sake

763
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,240
but all on us to drop by default by
checkpoint

764
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,020
I think this is a good stance I mean
it's obviously again so

765
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,170
say I'm the spirit of the Irish Sea is

766
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,900
a allowing for flexibility in checkpoint
space

767
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,810
you can only modify this behavior like
allowing them

768
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,120
by editing out the without death which
some

769
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,410
than those of you who are well off a
checkpoint operations some

770
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,030
this is Praveen not to step fell one
likes to perform and and and production

771
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,750
environments

772
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,020
and there is no way of enabling
extension he doesn't go away or

773
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,620
something

774
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,360
it's just the they are blocked and Tia

775
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,120
the say typical administrator has no
waste of enabling them

776
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,880
Adam that's probably I think there's a
spider by by decision

777
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,780
by the sign decision arm

778
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,760
so it can be avoided like people calling
out all all your final doesn't look

779
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,490
anything

780
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:23,000
could you please enable at this just
can't happen as long as you don't touch

781
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,630
table def a solar dayam have a very
strict filtering approach which

782
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,480
I think it's a good idea on the second
term

783
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,030
as i sat I effin IDPs

784
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,110
should function properly traffic must be
a

785
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,770
are somewhat as crop dust sanitized
before entering it

786
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,980
arm so it cannot be processed to

787
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,440
correctly do you want that

788
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,010
everything from your perspective adding

789
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,810
doping Texas ahead this you like em it
could be a safe policy for

790
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:00,160
the time being but I am some get us out
here too

791
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,640
provide some additional functionality
that to me too quiet for example

792
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,340
that cases hope I hope had that issue so
the local Inc

793
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,160
for older Tyler Thompson this complete
case even if the

794
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,310
the court networks soul there are some
risks Ipsos

795
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:20,420
I P six other one and I'll according to
721 12

796
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,480
in their PC case you also allows

797
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,670
to health the level headed in the second
fragment

798
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,180
so it's not that person is let's see
approach

799
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:36,250
of course if we don't use them drop them
my that's pretty straightforward for me

800
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,580
abut if you're going to need something
then

801
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,660
the process began to complicated yeah in
general I think a

802
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,250
drop them all and I even think um an ITS
pay some

803
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,480
extension had %uh should be deprecated
at at some point of time

804
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,470
which shouldn't be too descended the
future up

805
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,290
be sites all the technical sayin for you
provide at

806
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,150
we would like to we mind and encourage

807
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,350
although he'll that both from the
security we such as

808
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:15,240
perspective ipv6 is a quite interesting
protocol does many goya ya says many

809
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,980
are a cease and I sopra to cause and
South far nobody has looked on

810
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,570
a so far and

811
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,360
some when it comes like to

812
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,260
to practical implementation given be set
to its that it will be

813
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,640
it will haunt you the next 5 10 20 s

814
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,080
building a lab finding out

815
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,090
how actually I sus be hey if

816
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:45,400
how operating systems behave is so from
what we think a crucial step in any

817
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,210
type of well planned and prepared ipv6
deployment

818
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,500
that's at thanks for listening

819
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,620
on anti-black at

820
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:02,620
second day please we should def

821
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:08,560
like 10 minutes for questions this is
more lot others in what paper

822
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,100
are up will be published the block a
website

823
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,320
are that it happened to her and the
Pippin XP

824
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,570
a that you can find all that amount
lines

825
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,900
to use in order to evade these devices
to you can easily download

826
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,960
tyrant it would use I'll this case in
your environment a few ways

827
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,710
any questions we have a

828
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,970
like plan for what your five to 10
minutes if they are so

829
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:42,970
are questions let us know

830
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,250
yeah on the question was if

831
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,440
a regarding the statement that most
operating systems

832
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,810
process such crop to packets if we can
be more specific

833
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:03,120
yes we can I am actually first of all it
depends on the combination

834
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,700
alcohol doubt that different companies
was to give to get responses from

835
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,270
different operating system so

836
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,490
or cannot but it just it is justly
includes a strip is doable busy

837
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:16,020
but arm there was some paper arm

838
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,340
published in 2012 in a black hat Abu
Dhabi where that is

839
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,420
and ice well table that tomorrow is the
result

840
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,390
there was another presidential not drop
a school for us that wasn't 2013 in much

841
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,450
of 2013

842
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:34,120
what's update is out the social to load
the stocks you will find the

843
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,160
but that would somebody I as

844
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,340
I'm so that they can't give at let us
not now because it is epic battle the

845
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:41,850
case

846
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,670
with some doubt more than ten different
cases into hard out in some cases for

847
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:46,160
example

848
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,810
OpenBSD despondent and some other
windows responded

849
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,540
so deep into the comment is a luxury but
in general

850
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,990
I think one could be state that the most
robust implementation is free ps3 is the

851
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,540
exactly

852
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,310
the best there was the most robust one
all which

853
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,410
did not and as almost there was one mean
some

854
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,490
a means that the doesn't accept the

855
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,900
Dominican been a solo will be back on
business till he had this that do not

856
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,260
follow that accommodation

857
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,540
but don't own assess on a lot of our
research in that area and MySpace and

858
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,450
yes detailed we saw its ally can be such
a test case S&D so the responses of from

859
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:29,720
like a ten different but we have to ABC
Open this year

860
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,310
many windows washing fell in on so many
levels on RDS

861
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:37,070
even Mac OS X which itself is very much
sir for beers the eight

862
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,600
medical quality so it can be found it
just depends on the actual

863
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,800
case and to be honest when the blood
tests

864
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,350
into tied to fade 2052 any visual
technique

865
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,540
we also tried to find out which
operating system response to them

866
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,039
because you want to find a visit the
catwalks in most of them

867
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,700
if possible any more questions

868
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:04,089
I

869
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:09,799
I didn't get a question so for that time
but a problem

870
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:14,900
your dust in in your testing that you
find any founder said that this

871
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,950
analysts cracking stirs I P extensions

872
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,410
are now on that it's a

873
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,020
the that is as lead was a very good
interesting question a question was if

874
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,470
from

875
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,760
I mean you sonya that if they found any
positive examples

876
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,230
likely just a pointed out TSA -1 some

877
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,230
this what this way to follow that we
actually test that

878
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,549
so in in each of them we found issues
and

879
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:44,230
Sisi state at some I personally think
this is a kind of fun for a problem

880
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:49,240
assess too many variations a which show
with her like a look at a certain offset

881
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,250
of the pack at

882
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:54,859
and do so it may be even hotter like an
as exxon this convoy walk once you have

883
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:56,619
that cloudy space of our

884
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,510
combinations I believe it's a problem of
must have a guest suit

885
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,549
if you are more strict if you have
mosser

886
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:07,660
this must first this my second so on
then it may

887
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,079
this story I at some time right now I'm

888
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:14,890
we we don't have any positive samples I
got in fight was by the way

889
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,930
if you want about the fight wars up with
a lesson about

890
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:21,950
and about the fight was over there are
some the comments on the paper

891
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:26,010
it's not the father fodder for some
better than 90 based devices

892
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:29,380
exceptionally because five awards by
default to use only

893
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,670
use a default denial this is what it's a
slutty them

894
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:39,779
if you'd say it's they relented the use
a default lol type 2 Broke

895
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:42,960
blocked bloody some traffic then they
face the same problems

896
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,700
so it's that kind of the different
philosophy that we use the fire was at

897
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,260
safe situation

898
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:59,260
does not a question of whether are

899
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:04,250
right now I'm there is no such a license
but that might be that actually have a

900
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,150
good question

901
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,280
are a given BM a

902
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,089
mention the tie-in that architectural
approach some if you want in their EPS

903
00:57:12,089 --> 00:57:13,450
to function properly

904
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,240
scrub the traffic before then does the
IDPs this brings up the question did the

905
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,250
gentleman asked

906
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:23,010
ISO Nena devices which can perform
describing

907
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:26,300
a right now there are sewn on that we
are aware of

908
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,430
are we would expect that at some point
some

909
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:33,060
I like cum title

910
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,910
subtype so many boxes might be able to
perform this task to allow for father

911
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:41,010
on moms with a number processing

912
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:47,329
but right now no thing i cant

913
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:48,359
and have a good day
