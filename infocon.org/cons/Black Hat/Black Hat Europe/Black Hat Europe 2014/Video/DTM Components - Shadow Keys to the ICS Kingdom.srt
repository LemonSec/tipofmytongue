1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,810
hello all today and it was the last to
call the day

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,380
and I think a is good because so we have
and

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,230
a little technical had gone talk s I
think it small

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,339
light talk and about someone their
abilities

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:20,779
in industrial the 10 components and how
one vulnerable the 10 components good

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:24,150
a be and key to their

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,460
full I says king my name

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,580
is alexander buncha I work as I see it

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,260
informational Security Auditor at
digital security

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,440
I hope each day and also work as
assistant professor at saint petersburg

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,960
that the Technical University

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,190
my main research RI in a is distributed
system security

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,670
and I'm yet another man wearing some
color hat here's my collect yeah

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,180
its I am when I'm lips are both a also

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,149
Information Security Auditor and they're
so should digital security

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,690
and my with this is a penetration test
in an

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,820
some kinds of security assessments I'm
from plant time to time

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I hoax phone call to I like it and here
is so than gender for Outlook

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,439
at first we'll give you a small ICS 101
introduction

20
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,490
and they some key features of updated it
and technology

21
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,970
then we'll talk about our research
company I think technology s

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,840
after that we'll present shot
vulnerability statistics and the

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,030
at then though the talk will look and in
details

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,829
in some when their abilities and discuss
additive ashen

25
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:36,289
to stand their problems and make a small
conclusion

26
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,560
so in next year's slights I

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,649
wheeler you they key points of edited it
and technology

28
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,399
%uh time for some theory a a

29
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,280
I don't sass human or stands for I
industrial control system

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,450
today I says infrastructure are commonly
used in every factory and even in the

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,250
house till

32
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,110
I sensed me usually collects data from
remote station

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,909
also called field devices transmitters
are remote transmission units are tools

34
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,810
process it and you this after my to
tolerate them saw operator

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,700
drive and supervisor at a great comments
to be sent back to the field devices

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,690
you can find thousand some devices in a
facility to control them plant asset

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,319
management

38
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,200
bass of and mass systems are invented
bus systems out also managing plan to

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,690
set

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,060
and I feel devices controller said on
gateways and other things

41
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,260
they lie on the album and the level of
up on to ICS network and

42
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,209
I used for controlling late or
incomplete until devices different feel

43
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,799
particles flow in the industrial process
where

44
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,680
and I feel device exist here are some of
them hot based on for twenty year

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,239
and Milan Paris current loop profit by
the piano on bus

46
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,540
which uses RS 485 decline as a physical

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,010
layer Manchester must follow protocol
such as profess PA

48
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,040
and foundation film bill bass h1 and you
can see several

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,349
I field devices on this slide they'd

50
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,500
I designed to measure temperature
pressure and other parameters

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,919
where your files the ten companies
follow this transmitters

52
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,099
that shown on the screen during our
research and why we need to the

53
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,440
why the industry need that special
technology for them

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,819
imagine a modern industrial facility
power plant for example

55
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,540
and think about how many different field
devices think this in its infrastructure

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,730
Donsol for temperature

57
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,769
a the sound source pressure sensors and
now that useful transmitters

58
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,010
this device up from different vendors
work with different lol protocols and

59
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,280
organized in into complex hierarchical
networks

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,980
now ask yourself how to support other
devices

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,150
even working not to each other than with
a handheld communicator

62
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,879
could be painful now the problem is a
use a shelf

63
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,480
the DCS when you're creating and DCS
distributed control system %ah SCADA

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,920
I you need to work with all this
transmitter so we need

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,160
and the industry I needed that
technology that tonight

66
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,470
all the transmitters and this the
solution

67
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,660
exists and it called field device type
device that matter justification

68
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,310
I invented by MTT group in shot and it
is standardize their communication and

69
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,510
configuration interface

70
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,160
between oil field devices and ha systems
and the dam provides a unified structure

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,330
for accessing device parameters
configuring and operating

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,830
the devices and diagnosing problems I

73
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,340
according to edit a group the creator
and maintain a Ralph

74
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,229
I have that the specification and
e-commerce almost all levels so the

75
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:34,750
blunt

76
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,340
from there field devices from then

77
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,400
fill level from the sensor and actor bus

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,490
up to that and enterprise resource
planning systems on the upper levels

79
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,400
all their ICS infrastructure and other
sites you can see it exact places in

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,660
there I says infrastructure where the 10
components of Duty containers exists

81
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,889
its a PCR lab for process control

82
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,039
like I said management I'm assault bus
distributes control systems

83
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,570
human machine interface and
manufacturing execution system

84
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,099
mess I think year and the 10 company and
concepts according to have the two

85
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:14,490
groups

86
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,340
are shown on the slide this is a long
list I'm sorry for them for showing it

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,190
& bottai and a setup that with bald

88
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,250
their key concepts that could be and
nice point for attack

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,760
for example automatic generation of
dependent parameters diagnostic

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,980
functions customize for device and no
direct connection to any other

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,140
device I'll show you why the last point
is a key point

92
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,640
I sell simplified scheme of working
edited it and like it actually shown on

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,240
this light

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,380
as you can see that frame application
its it's usually a plant asset

95
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,230
management system

96
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,790
carries all the 10 components in its com
container

97
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,430
when the device that ended in 10 combine
and that walks all field devices wants

98
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,280
to send some data

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,810
it will ask the Condit am the component
responsible for

100
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,080
talking over industrial bus Anna

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,340
to send some data to the modern on
gateway and then the data will pass

102
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,310
the modern and goes directly it to the
transmitters and

103
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,180
by Sasa here is the screenshot

104
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,370
how feel care a typical have to take on
10-year all process them

105
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,120
I in terms of FDTD damn it's also called
heavy duty frame application

106
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,230
you can see that and hierarchy of

107
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,880
ICS network on the left all the
screenshot

108
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,310
minutes in better-quality month there
are some

109
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,980
transmitter so gateways and even LCS on
their eyesight you can see there

110
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,410
the damn component itself eights ActiveX
greer

111
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,880
a front-end with configuration for some

112
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,880
temperature transmitter from Anderson
how to and on this like you could see it

113
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,580
they in turn architecture on the damn
stand up

114
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,010
it's a bit complex but I want you to
know that important things

115
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,160
fast I X Men is used as an internal data
exchange for mine between frames

116
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,990
occasion incompetence and between
confidence and self

117
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,450
and second the date is encapsulated
while traveling to the 10

118
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,140
architecture that it could great insight
into the frame container

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,850
that is how it to happens I so imagine

120
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,520
and ICS infrastructure that is shown on
the right

121
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,340
the heart transmitter is I resists on
the current line it is connected to some

122
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,930
gateway that is connected to the FU bus
for example procter bus

123
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,280
to their gateway and a gateway

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,530
connects their filibuster that has
Internet to their

125
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,810
and

126
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,450
on the set management on their the sea
on this error

127
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,260
when the the 10 components company and
all the transmitter want to send some

128
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,370
data it will

129
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,410
go and poss all the 10 components

130
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,280
from on down to the up as you can see on
the left side of the picture

131
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,470
and that data will be back to
encapsulated

132
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,650
and wanted to reach Bazar at level it
will go

133
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,330
inject it into the net and sent all I
ICS network

134
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,960
and then the data will be a de capsule
88 on their

135
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,380
devices on the Gateway San at last it
will

136
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,480
be injected in that contemplated with
duck

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,050
about a great fish is some validity to
Tampa 10 slides now and it

138
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,720
it might be really good technology but
in reality dating company in some based

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,400
on such technologists and use such

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,180
the chest ass shown %uh that 32

141
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,670
ActiveX Visual Basic 6 yes back to
nineteen

142
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,680
dotnet calm back to nineteen again

143
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,240
Xmas stack than a single trad

144
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,790
appliance a single trait and federal
process control of course when dust from

145
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,300
mount kit process control

146
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,810
so I think well MDT it ms planet it
should look

147
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,090
like a great column that I left

148
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,360
picture but in reality it became
something clack

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,190
on their act strange thing I K

150
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,580
and now that will continue with our such
scope yeah

151
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,660
couple a couple forcible torso scope
soul

152
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,060
the on soulfood at: competence and
thousands of

153
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,570
devices soul with some home needed to
adjust our

154
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,940
research scope a in all we wanted to

155
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,300
also some questions so why is

156
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,030
FDTD to them and architecture is weak a

157
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,800
what kind of all abilities I may cause
the

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,160
compromise of ices infrastructure around
the way

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,430
what about to a titty to

160
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,080
security how wealthy a

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,250
to answer this question so we needed to
take although if the two companies in

162
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,330
them the check out to

163
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,970
we should all the real to the so and how
much is

164
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,230
the soul finally we're

165
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,570
decided to bones are so scope to

166
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,820
if the two companies that walks will
heart protocol

167
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,890
and the too cool about 1000 I'll

168
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,220
hopes or about 100 have them and about
3,000

169
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,730
I have the licensed the 10 components
and about

170
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,300
1000 for the heart with talk about 10
percent solid

171
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,220
and we'll work with them 10

172
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,630
way with a look that the hot components
well some room for its

173
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,840
a were already the down from research
will call for the colour wheel

174
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,480
we're all familiar with it and went bust
to

175
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,340
have developed for some hardware tools
to operate with an attack

I'll send presented before

221
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,100
a bit later both booth call devices

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,370
up upon connection to the current loop
will

223

that they kirkum no specialist leave

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,010
ended that the that circulating on bus
and the

225
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,540
even inject some data or impersonate the

226
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,350
a mobile devices or

control system or interpret impersonate
third

229
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,480
we have the control system mounds of
them then some

230
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,310
a bitter that the what's worse a booth

231
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,740
devices and the guy National Account
link

232
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,950
his lil it look like what a pleasant
Vall

233
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,430
scenario a week don't think

234
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,690
too long range do you still through of
heart wings them so

235
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,740
or actuators for kids of the elected to

236
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,180
in uncontrolled in secure areas such
devices may be a

237
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,720
installed for into a minute or so away
from

238
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,840
main building so we were control systems
with you own from control

239
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,860
own booze do I so absolutely on both XO
to in the face of threats but the

240
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,540
connections

241
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,710
basically it's I put it on there

242
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:54,020
oil or gas a water pipeline up %ah from
away the control building

243
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,220
to control the pressure maybe
temperature in mind the corrosion

244
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,600
on the parameters right right

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,800
like all the flood whose photo from

246
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,850
marketing book lives from somewhere
under

247
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,210
we also researched the and

248
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,530
look for close the lid to the

249
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,600
D Tim compliment for views device as you
can see here

250
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,470
Luther heart of me to move from but they
also found the lessons

251
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,490
the connected to the current loop and
it's mounted to

252
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,090
direct the to the biplane somewhere in
Duluth

253
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,110
I by bit the there is no one

254
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,280
in milking in kilometers the way and the

255
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,180
its the transmitter along with the

256
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,130
you'll moan thorson dealers not know I'm
help him

257
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,410
a another flap

258
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,110
the show the wilds heart device
connected to the current loop

259
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,380
and also weaken Syria well as from
transmitter connects to the

260
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,520
who are they worth with the control
system a

261
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,760
when the well as comfort is the ho

262
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,920
have some security systems alike

263
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,520
encryption let loose and the about 2010
there was this

264
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,050
last the whole available to flip through
but the connection

265
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,190
their trip to the worsening you here we
go

266
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,020
on in our search for youth

267
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,960
some hardware tools to walk in with them

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,310
that they can heart devices so how plans

269
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,120
who do so. the on the left side table
this led to this is so hard shield

270
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,050
it to the heart model hard modem

271
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,080
I'll extension board for popular or are
doing a bore

272
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,010
and the have the right to consider

273
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,430
a it's called basis course there is some
multiple course

274
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,000
though the gym most propose device for

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,839
Odin no low-level and also protocol flag
heart

276
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,120
won both up brotha bus the US can be
controlled through

277
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,510
directly via USB cable from computer

278
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,290
or room for example WiFi or Bluetooth or
and then

279
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,089
well as interface the whom we can
connect through the

280
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,270
you could be interface her me Anna

281
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,850
know my time your Anna and when implant

282
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,240
that talk I think it the about not
showing

283
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,760
are showing this is Dana but I think I
should show that quick week

284
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,390
them up from that we have demonstrated
at Black Hat USA

285
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,730
and maybe someone have been on our talk
and

286
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,360
like it here say any hence no one

287
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,420
okay that the I'm right K

288
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,760
and and this is this de Maya and
demonstrates how

289
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,280
easily you could inject in the current a
loop line what you want

290
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,780
on a this is an attack on and the teens
the structure of course

291
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,640
but its attack on the empty frame the
rest of the talk will be a

292
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,300
and about attacking the 10 components
not the entity frame itself but this is

293
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,629
attack on the Edit efrain

294
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,660
okay and here is a quick about

295
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,830
the infrastructure we have health care
it's a

296
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,520
plant asset management system MDT
container will have a subsystem

297
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,810
they feel care is connected to the
subsystem and sending

298
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:31,720
periodically send some data about a ICS
do that here P

299
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,580
and its a divided by firewall

300
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,330
that'll also on HTTP traffic Anna also
we have

301
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,720
hartman them that is connected to fill
care and their

302
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,360
industrial transmitter on the current
top and here we use

303
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,289
the vulnerability in SAP a and I it was
found by

304
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,500
metres just lookin two years ago but

305
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,950
this is on their as a demonstration how
we can

306
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,900
extent our tax for the ICS network from
the lowest level to the highest level

307
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,000
I K no I think

308
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,390
it's time for some he did Emma could you
bring it thing

309
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,159
%uh ops that's wrong

310
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,940
ok said

311
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,510
min okay

312
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,460
that stopped so here is my light

313
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,420
and here's our lap and as you can see
this is an

314
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,190
transmitter this is that also scope

315
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,520
and you could see that the heart site
signal is going through their

316
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,910
on oscilloscope and you can see that
past system

317
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,270
here it is and it gets some data from
the transmitter

318
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,530
and the transmitter isn't connected to
the real

319
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,900
sensor so weekend just monitor the
current loop

320
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,990
current on and the transmitter is
without case

321
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,830
the usually transmitters affecting their

322
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,100
ahead still cases seen hour left that my
table will be broken

323
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,320
with this yeah an SL so

324
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,530
a

325
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,800
an with for removed %uh the shell from
it and

326
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,090
this is their I feel care system

327
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:22,220
it get some data from the transmitter
and

328
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,820
on their I'll write you have seen and
the 10 company

329
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,490
and this is their set SAP system as you
can see you could really should buy

330
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,340
HTTP now I have written some Metasploit
model you can't find it

331
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,430
on my it happen I will give you a link
at the top

332
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,710
and here is the ICS consider kasar
Barack I is connected to that

333
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,440
a laptop with USB and I just need

334
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,900
to connect tool are wires to the current
loop

335
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,620
I can do it directly by connecting clear

336
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,840
and resistor all by using a sealer
needles

337
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,230
just insert needle into their a

338
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,690
wire copper wire and that's enough for
their heart that he is the

339
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:10,290
very reliable protocol it will work it
is designed for this

340
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,280
and now I'm connecting this line could
be the

341
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,840
up to two kilometers long I sister sarah
is where a powerful device

342
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,220
and hopes and

343
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,080
wrong use the device and I'll set their
correct bus

344
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,580
part of the ICS Corsair and the

345
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,070
now run and the shell will appear in a
minute

346
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,070
as you can see it at at best we're and
jamming the line

347
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,350
and then model heart love them going
crazy our gateway heart love them

348
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,130
and as you can see a that their a

349
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,280
RR is that in that bill Kerr interface

350
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,320
and what's that typically reaction all
their I

351
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,880
field engineer if he see it such false

352
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,150
he will a rest out reckon act

353
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,730
rs.com the current loop for fault so he
did it

354
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,120
the

355
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,390
he did it now

356
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,230
there Chris coming started and as you
can see

357
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,440
we've got the shell

358
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,890
on their SAP Sarah as a tenant

359
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,210
by the developer suffered at it and I
think

360
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,410
and I K

361
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,750
and that you take the sometime

362
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,120
on no I'll I think I could return to my

363
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,650
presentation well yes the second

364
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,200
and a

365
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,100
give you some explanation I K

366
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,570
so what what happened %uh we have

367
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,730
now changed that long

368
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,880
attack variable on their heart
transmitter

369
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,200
its internal variable that is get by
that plant asset management

370
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,300
that this variable I'm when it's going
to the

371
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,790
through the plant asset management and
through that the cam eat

372
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,790
going through the XML document remember
I've talk about sex and that

373
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,460
and of course if you put as single quote
so they'd

374
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,110
we have xom.n injection then will alter
the external

375
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,430
on X is this scheme from there evil web
Sarah that contains

376
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,570
the Sarah site request forgery called if
you want

377
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,860
the more details you could look and
they're black hat USA

378
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,510
14 white paper a good explanation it I
and finally a we have

379
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,220
SSR after that year he and and then what

380
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,740
command execution acquire will send to
the AARP

381
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,060
on so as you can see it's

382
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,470
vary is a need to inject into the
current loop line

383
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,900
its and its my heart design

384
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,910
that yup

385
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,750
choose their home hmm

386
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,630
so with both to at like models in the
second attack

387
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,360
model that their cups to connect to the
end of the rolling through the

388
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,710
we show a to millions account data more
for example it may be a

389
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,840
one bus all-pro to both and thirds

390
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,220
atticus model is the classic into zones
are well-known IP networks which

391
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,550
also made transferred to industrial
brought the course like

392
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,570
a carp or interception of

393
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,180
for a longer range for a look at that
connection links the

394
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,380
control station the flake on blue slate

395
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,590
it's the example though live from on

396
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,570
Emerson primary dealer I here we can see
a

397
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,820
a hotlink earth and completing into
long-range radio channel to control

398
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,490
system

399
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,690
a again somewhere in well-deserved mmm

400
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,810
in the Thirroul devices like desserts

401
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,230
I think

402
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,430
a so at all we've got the

403
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:13,620
Hong Kong 114 due to incompetence from
24

404
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,240
lenders and therefore phone

405
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,480
in Congo's 52m devices civic

406
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,650
scope kill some some when they're sold
it in companies that we researched

407
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,630
around the we hope phone plume

408
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,520
some bucks soon some confidence with by
this when those two

409
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,170
all the bill the gym components

410
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,560
the can the with little

411
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,240
the me that we are researched can be
divided in

412
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,550
to the big group nope

413
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,880
but when the itself and to develop by

414
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,100
I'll source company almost call for for
all companies who also sits

415
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,720
in 22 only to developers its

416
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,020
called ride sounds M&M you could see the
the distribution on the screen

417
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,160
35 components or before though but and
on them

418
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,940
and 15 by Brotherhood's a

419
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,270
looser also save room for have their own

420
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,360
beauty and frameworks to you don't
believe League

421
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,100
media rated automatically it's a good
what a good for us

422
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,480
growth so all the ultimate again it its
components the

423
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,400
of course have the same volume growth so

424
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,810
Colin tried before that the Holy Father

425
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,200
full a

426
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,450
a lot of companies the all wear a
different a different technologies

427
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,290
different frameworks different
programming thing those

428

emulation of physical device

432
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,550
and the to rule hardware emulation of

433
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,770

other components group

436
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,580
heroes the software and hard look dole
queue that we used in

437
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,870
no all research fails to do so

438
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,060
hearts parser is the all read them

439
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,510
the sector right library for cards

440
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,450
a second to lose the house then later is
a

441
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,170
Ruby written were flexible harp but
again you're a true that use the

442
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,380
filth know how far so

443
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,360
among for detail father is the

444
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,690
our custom DTM kom communication DTM
component

445
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,370
the so we're youth for proxy fine that
them

446
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,430
and the of us frame

447
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,440
first frame with you the and Melissa

448
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,720
fully functional in late 2004 I'll frame
implication

449
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,810
for boss for a publication we can
download

450
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,940
includes although other the gym
competence

451
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,120
own their work in inside this component

452
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,710
and leave town all ok any the

453
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,040
old indoor mall processor so long term
old interconnections

454
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,750
overconfidence though look at the by

455
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,350
details by it's a bottle for 3m a

456
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:48,840
and the author said before where you
third a couple hundred fulfills a

457
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,030
Asus course there around for

458
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,680
Huntsville are going up the first way we
use

459
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,440
for was a software-defined do
assimilation through the

460
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,580
our communication comb that them
competent

461
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,120
willow the yep

462
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,700
a if left up we can see the

463
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,220
so we loaded for the target do I that
them that we research that for the

464
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,710
moment

465
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,780
in the real for application its

466
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,900
filled with health care and the

467
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,340
configure sit through a work crew our up
her father that

468
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,910
DTM communication component well the

469
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,240
and divide them request some doubt

470
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,559
data from the mutual device moon

471
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,370
communicator new was the gym don't know
that that's

472
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,559
not real device in ther send the request
I request

473
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,679
southward through the you to be protocol
from our

474
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,890
communication did him competent 2000

475
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,640
haupt but did you know later and parcel

476
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,910
it surpasses those request with help of

477
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,920
on house parcel around the

478
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,080
form the house for own some home with a
tube through the

479
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,710
our Father and Ralph and the real summer
them some magic

480
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,240
finally with some residents and then
check it it is

481
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,000
mandated you the

482
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,130
second present model is similar to
previous one

483
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,980
um but he will use the real Worldcom
Communications ATM which communicated

484
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,520
through

485
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,870
00 a.m. related device through the your
soul

486
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:37,070
the serial interface a was in part so
this may be the same as them

487
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,850
previous another three terms the most
realistic model

488
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,300
we use the to check on bugs so that we
phoned

489
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,559
I is the full hardware

490
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,090
the isolation will nicest person ever
barth

491
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,179
up control to with the same car

492
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,910
to labor it went was in close to go
before our special device connected

493
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,299
through filter with

494
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:04,360
current loop onto the real house more
them

495
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,429
and the in

496
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:12,399
who field Caro the possibly cation
willow the burial

497
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,799
communication did him company on tho
final it target devise the Tim

498
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,909
around the this way we're trying to

499
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,929
trigger real well and abilities

500
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:27,590
okay and now it's time to talk about
results I hope

501
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,600
you done in part %uh the final result is
shown

502
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,879
on the picture so as you could see

503
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:39,639
we have 29 components 29

504
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,989
components with will their abilities and

505
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:47,739
they rest and is it not for memorable
maybe

506
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,830
not or liable because we didn't spend
very much time on

507
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,480
I think and fighting still continue and
a sense

508
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,590
the fighting stopped who have found at
least three bucks more

509
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,720
month they're not here and I

510
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,590
you can see and that the ES about a 25
percent you can't grated as that

511
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,249
go to bette result but look at that and
diagram on the right

512
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:15,029
we have found box in the most

513
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,649
of devices so unfortunately or
fortunately

514
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:23,009
wowie the vulnerabilities have been
found in the components

515
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:26,029
that collars many many devices

516
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:30,639
about a 68.7% percent about 500 devices

517
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:34,239
that's and that's better good good for
us

518
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:37,570
that far and ICS and I think

519
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,789
here is that distribution of
vulnerability by type

520
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:45,190
we have found several confirmed remote

521
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,649
icon execution and have proof-of-concept
exploits for them I will chill

522
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:54,179
the Delphine exploit and then to the doc
I several race condition of course

523
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,290
and then of Ceres the

524
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,140
that could crash the damn could crest
container

525
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,800
could crash their industrial bus device
drivers

526
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,870
and could totally crash the windows XP
system and Windows Vista system

527
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,680
we test it on this system because its
that environment

528
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,559
usual environment for such assistance
and that's it

529
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,950
I also now is seven cases it could be
possible

530
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,540
remote code execution or at least memory
corruption

531
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,059
on dental ins of service we didn't have
developed the

532
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,970
their proof of concept exploits for them
it's in progress I

533
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,400
also we have not to exceed that
injections

534
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,710
like a I've showed you in there I V día
de la botte

535
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,929
not the in there if the container but in
that

536
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:47,330
the damn compliment 2x injections and
it's the several other vulnerabilities

537
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,679
such as phrases

538
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,720
long time for this one that a system
freezes some

539
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,860
strange apart functions the strange

540
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,740
and that of course we found one cross
site scripting XSS

541
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:05,030
hand that's that's nice I will show you
and here are some of messages

542
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,200
that have got during our I think from

543
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,000
denial of service to the memory
corruptions and

544
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,800
right written to protection protected
man around 100 exceptions

545
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,940
other flaws found out about the things
Anna

546
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,860
that's funny nah read it

547
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,929
I really want to Shelia all that crap
that we have

548
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,550
found but I can do it right now sorry
guys we have beat white hats

549
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:35,010
so responsible disclosure sorry for that
will show on this on finance trace

550
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,820
thinks and the vulnerability demo

551
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,590
with hidden vendor and device names
that's all we can do responsible

552
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,690
disclosure sorry %ah

553
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,470
but we can show you the distribution of
online /url it is bi vendor

554
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,290
interviews by the dams and buy the
devices

555
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,179
as you could see a for example Anderson
hauser have

556
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,570
when their abilities on the in several
components bind their devices that

557
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,390
affect it

558
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,670
by this will their abilities I really
really Lodge count

559
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,250
about %ah powerful devices that's

560
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,680
that's how it works and the same stats

561
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,430
but fall sources as you can see a using
or not using

562
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,730
outsource will not affect the resulting
quality audit and compliance

563
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,930
about 50 percent see 50/50 and

564
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,640
South time for some fun and we'll show
you some strange man and it isn't funny

565
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,079
things

566
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,609
II as I sent you one bit if it were
found

567
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:33,750
and XSS cross site scripting when their
ability

568
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,760
and of course it's not usable do that by
a lot size it's a really small pale alt

569
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,369
for ya script it's really a small and

570
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:46,500
they are content security policies so
they

571
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,130
will not work in reality but its
redefining

572
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,589
the configuration data sheet in there
has to be two or AP

573
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:58,040
handed down from GE Oil & Gas I is
format using a steamy

574
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,290
you could see the g8 law got call log on
the right

575
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,359
had and the device that can long tech
ongoing them on filtrate

576
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,780
as always and so you couldn't see the
set about 40 bytes

577
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,710
of the OSC it go there and their fine
now that

578
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,150
will appear and

579
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,650
all South on I don't like

580
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,049
understand how the company they always
ignoring my and

581
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:29,140
vulnerability rappers they don't
transfer for yes

582
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,460
soul now I described and but let us
close

583
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,430
of course Anna then

584
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,579
I always known you that they ignoring
stand that still

585
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:48,059
and so as you may remember the max in
Landshut messages about 200 that

586
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,960
and fifty a 5 bytes but the Anderson
house

587
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,099
developers write software that crashes
even done the legal

588
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:58,150
according to specification packets was
sent just

589
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,200
217 bytes and what we see

590
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,410
you guessing other flaw they

591
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,210
just don't read the standouts Anna

592
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,970
it's a dental if there is because that
the 10 company that is written

593
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,750
in the Visual Basic bot how could they
develop in such a way

594
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,420
we just sent a legal pink

595
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,230
that crash and now some other developer

596
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,400
assaulted and components are too lazy
ought the

597
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,780
to call art to even feel they're
executable strings

598
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,400
to Bill company name to do file
description to the product name maybe

599
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,850
they

600
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:36,690
hear that there rail you there so that
companies will catch them

601
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,800
and by and yeah after

602
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,420
size she set to air quality and a here s
the area then I think

603
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:51,600
and as you could know there is at secure
a fashion of Mensa by ask here you could

604
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,310
see there really secure

605
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,610
use ish of Mansa by ass as you could see
a

606
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,140
their second parameter and fourth
parameter are the same

607
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,340
Anna exercise multiply by tool

608
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,170
is equal to count so they use Inc man to
buy ass

609
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,780
as that Mansa buy it without security
mechanisms

610
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,710
and it off cause leads to that and then
I love Sarah saw

611
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,770
even walks and thats

612
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,580
that secure a use a chef man supply from
than

613
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,770
on and I'm down after I can bash

614
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,020
and now I know who is working for this
company

615
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,550
and how they're writing such code

616
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:38,020
I K and I hear that they're seeing

617
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,770
mmm remote code execution de Molina our
around the calculator so the current

618
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,270
loop

619
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,980
I hope I can do it %uh

620
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,280
okay here at this as you can see I would
have

621
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,430
fill cap I and their

622
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,990
company and inside their vendor is
hidden

623
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,210
of course responsible disclosure and a

624
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,300
you can see where starting kala our
Father

625
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,950
and

626
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,970
just read data from device it will be a

627
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,910
really fast yes and here at this

628
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,370
the calculator

629
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,250
and as you can see transfer their bilk
airframe

630
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,400
morrow are as you could see a we just

631
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,560
now cancel this transaction the timeout
will pass

632
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,430
and the health care will stay life so we
could room alt their

633
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,990
execute code in the context
over-the-hill cat and the field engineer

634
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,390
while

635
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:40,370
won't notice any think the field cat
just contains

636
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:45,570
the normal work and the calculator is
running hi

637
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,710
cell up just the second

638
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,690
I will continue and now that

639
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,870
sadistic science Anna as you can see it

640
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,310
well Radisson that good quality of some
the dam se

641
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,020
isn't very good morrow almost details
were compiled without essential security

642
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,070
mechanisms

643
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,960
that's why we could say that so much at
sea equity work

644
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,840
Anna as you can see on this seven number
of components

645
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,690
have state caucus that exchange
protection and understand our

646
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,250
a space layout randomization enabled
though mall Ste

647
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,650
on the company and have a disabled at
all and that's

648
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,410
really good for us really battle and us
we need

649
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,820
to do found think till attractive
Anderson attention to this

650
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,930
I'll now are as you can see I'm getting
national on is a good from security

651
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,530
point of view

652
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,770
but isn't that the group introduced in
his petition entity

653
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,020
the national tour let's talk a bit about
it %ah

654
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,220
make a difference this of natin to

655
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,670
there's a special one that a good
interest in ass from

656
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,310
security sites %ah and up that basis its

657
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,550
now on the dot net no more call

658
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,690
nah Visual Basic hell and %uh they're

659
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,990
absence of XML than interaction between
have that the object is based on that

660
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,130
and other types rather than excellent
not

661
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,810
this Jen just a really looks very good
but there are several pitfalls

662
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,089
I

663
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:24,390
I'm past I eat it still has a very low
spread all industry

664
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,989
we didn't see any entity mesh into
component

665
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:32,119
hi in in the wild even though we didn't
see

666
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,579
in the official added to group catalog
on that site editing group

667
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:40,710
not dark there are no such components so
I think they didn't exist

668
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,210
the on the stand to take this II I'll

669
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,079
also they and did the Russian too has a
backward compatibility

670
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:53,089
Anna and ability to deserialize a
serialized does not object

671
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,229
intakes a metalworking with that
previous company owns

672
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:59,859
so infrastructure could be built a
potential to emit a national on

673
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:00,549
competence

674
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:04,789
so nothing changed in this site if you
have

675
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:09,930
at least one and added 21 component in
infrastructure nothing will change

676
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,420
also mentioned called it's a great idea
but

677
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,309
a it will not be a complete edition if I
managed code is still used

678
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:22,799
for example we've seen some an audit and
compliance with

679
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:26,460
was really really secure a front end on
that net or Visual Basic

680
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,690
might incite it calls and unmanaged C
plus plus coat with

681
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,739
such Mansa by asahara funny things

682
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:39,099
%ah unfortunately as I said we couldn't
find any real device apart by MTT

683
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,210
version 2002 tested I if you have one

684
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:46,579
we can borrow it from you have for some
time and writer next

685
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:50,069
presentation I the other think that I

686
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,099
an think isn't very good

687
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,190
a about the divorce until its

688
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,430
that and relation of

689
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:05,079
and it a group to the security on with
phone to Bach

690
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:08,880
in one a specification about a year ago

691
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,029
they published the security paper about
it on the

692
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:15,869
several weeks ago a year has passed

693
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:20,640
morrow or they didn't and mansion OSA as

694
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,749
authors in its a security bit n

695
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:28,470
and named ask as a group of Russian
hackers

696
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,130
not a digital security company not then

697
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,640
the security research is but a group of
Russian hackers

698
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,280
min %uh tomorrow are they

699
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,820
in its security ability and they just
feel to it that

700
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,880
double quote they they have a year to
fix the double quote filtering

701
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,090
to make a security bill it and they have
a single quote

702
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,320
they have an ampersand an excellent I
think it

703
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,100
it will take several yes to also they
have a buncha for CS

704
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,170
I didn't want to know what they will say

705
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:08,660
so time for conclusions web link to
actively work with vendors

706
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,310
directly with endorse through the ICS at
us rare earths out

707
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,990
I hope the South Pole discovered
problems we didn't disclose it

708
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,540
the full report on the phone from their
abilities will appear will help 'cause

709
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,930
in spring/summer on my next year we
could not publish more information on

710
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,470
this point and could not release

711
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,970
dolls some pills I because up did
irresponsible disclosure I said

712
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:34,360
also a plan to publish the sources the
same time next year

713
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,250
during our session of fast about 114
components found

714
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,470
29 at this

715
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:47,630
day 32 vulnerabilities and the

716
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:52,280
the quality of most company and see is
lower than I don't if you have one of

717
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,120
5 ano 500 different device with
vulnerable than competence

718
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,950
the industrial facility could be at risk
I however they said except possible only

719
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,610
because of

720
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,980
detail wetin not only because what of
did and witnesses

721
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,100
but also due to bridge ally says
infrastructure that price to the pile

722
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,230
ICS lot motel and network should be
changed it

723
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,130
as I think otherwise we will face the
risk of such a little bit is over and

724
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:17,810
over again

725
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,160
and if the Russian to quit compensate if

726
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,830
used with cap of course some problems
but unfortunately a

727
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:29,280
it doesn't actively use now so what we
can do now is just waiting

728
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,270
and also sponsors and hoping for they
get me the best we always hope for the

729
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,920
best in the ICS security

730
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,360
I here are some links

731
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,680
the fest repository didn't

732
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,270
exist it will be great at Anfield up on
their

733
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,809
have endorsed responses I could not put
their real father in cold there because

734
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:52,410
you can fasten this is this class size
bike so

735
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,530
sorry I hope in spring kit will be
filled

736
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,640
and their I Cisco sera shitty sale the

737
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,720
shield and hard bass are open you
condone lot you can

738
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,650
sold or you can build the devices you
can experiment known

739
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,040
with them their SS who

740
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,690
loss a a bit hot you don't think again
Sarah so we want to thank saddam is your

741
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,589
castle and judging nothing come from

742
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:20,200
all-out for for some minor magic and
great help in rice engineering and

743
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,849
creating provocative pics lights

744
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:25,410
and Rebekah of our our general security
analyst

745
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,520
for help in finding X injections my
friend

746
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,339
for a seven-year for fun some fighting I
D S and a great

747
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:37,089
Art Walk girl by Alexander Popov rain
the ground picture for the presentation

748
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:41,440
went down sorry fallback English and of
a Russian accent

749
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:48,440
sorry for that any questions

750
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:54,420
so what recommendation

751
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,319
the uses of the technology well tip

752
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,700
thinks these problems but the of it

753
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,869
but production what

754
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:09,349
I at blast in the and that security bill
it and there was

755
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:12,809
some right thoughts as I think I you
need

756
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:16,739
to deploy some I firewalls of course on
their

757
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:20,460
between middle and the high-level

758
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,440
on the plant to prevent lauding that
external XML schema seek sexies

759
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,529
other things and asphalt the low-level

760
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:33,279
physical security physical security
physical security a

761
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:36,859
and maybe you could use some special
firewalls

762
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:39,900
between the layers I

763
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,539
from to enable all some some other
things from some spunk

764
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:48,739
the devices the and other things

765
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:52,019
that could detect the exact attack

766
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:56,890
a signature so you could just
implementing a taxi

767
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,979
signature for example in that the tables
when I

768
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:03,979
for example you have account look
connected to that filled by central bus

769
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:05,799
connected to the internet you could put

770
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:09,599
between want to set management and as
our net

771
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,599
feel bad gateway yasser with like the
tables for example

772
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,680
it said chip solution had it's a free
session and a diet the right to the

773
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,980
him signatures with that deep packet
inspection and deny such packets

774
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,819
just based on the exactly are built this

775
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:32,410
thats the if you cannot the

776
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,970
bill then really secure from physical
