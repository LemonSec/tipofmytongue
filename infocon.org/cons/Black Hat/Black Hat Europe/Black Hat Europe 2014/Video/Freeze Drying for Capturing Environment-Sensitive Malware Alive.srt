my main decides interest as system say
go today

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,950
and I can access control us hope editing
system

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,130
such as: a Monday Terry

30
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,700
access control best son the box also

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,100
a button mashing bests our way up but
initial system

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,280
to have do you know

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,189

in a many such have a produced a
hypervisor for academic project

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,700
project at the hypervisor a

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,950

my test team sex.com Assad operations

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,320
and on audit system development

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,470
now will be holding an

55
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,860

do you know ghost in the senate ok

65
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,630
in how many Japanese happen like
cyberpunk animation

66
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,100
I'm also one of them so

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,300
are now I'll director move on

68
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,340
to our main project and shares Sao

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,420
about you over today's presentation fast

70
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,620
they did talk about clothes are no cops
office to get that

71
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,580
sophisticated modem outta there at

72
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,860
after that I describe the idea of

73
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,890
capturing and I'm are out and it first
challenges

74
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,400
in damn I

75
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,550
just read the implementation of our
system called

76
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,680
and past our system court spaceport

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,900
and and to give a demonstration over

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,460
capturing the sweet spot and

79
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,620
eighth so today and now they're

80
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,640
a justice army knife of cybercrime

81
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,250
cyber s been as and this title

82
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,470
as you know today's mobile use

83
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,360
on it miss many and Shh analysis
technique it's

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,490
at just after the another this is a
problem

85
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,260
a because we have to prevent the measure
s

86
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,630
behavior ok unknown malware and

87
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,140
and we have to prepare next at that so

88
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,290
the video you want to know tomorrow as
true

89
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,770
intention victim

90
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,610
organization to what saturday at a pub
us

91
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,960
at a near a target you have to force

92
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,280
tomorrow about to give up its accept it

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,720
a for example iron to doubt that it is

94
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,190
the marrero thats targets our
linebacking it can detect

95
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,690
the environment shown I N execution
environments

96
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,460
and the does not English in my chest
behavior

97
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,500
ran the current host differs from

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,300
the infected hosts the pup us

99
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,040
over this behavior it's a iBook eats too

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,420
about analysis boasts mean

101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,840
man you're and automatic likes under
books and that is yes

102
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,240
share I'd like to

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
introduce standards analysis technique
it's

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,920
half assed I'll discuss hosting a baking

105
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,170
and sick and and batching machine

106
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,400
and there's some books detection this iz

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,950
and Dagenham over host having a binding

108
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,870
at to the the source

109
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,030
is served by several uniting and using a
unique value

110
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,810
followed the victim host this spot is
set

111
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,320
have fanned forces infected by

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:18,320
the origin about of today and
embodiments estimated other

113
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,230
and the the was in hob defiance by any
patents

114
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,550
help us

115
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,600
is towards an hour star their lands

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,080
own only the infected host this

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,090
embodiment says David behavior uses

118
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,410
about you hope to discus globally unique

119
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,520
I'd intro so it's called G

120
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,710
the DUI de it compares dodi idea but
here

121
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,210
over to everyday cute and have sorry

122
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,330
have executing host and

123
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,500
the and by that GUID value over the

124
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,590
infected host

125
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,790
this source are exposure

126
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,920
of at DUI de

127
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,500
air where and

128
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,910
after unpacking and dish

129
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,990
let's move on to the next point ass
somebody and solves

130
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,380
to I'll I miss peace p.m. and a sandbox
detection

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,070
for example found today to such as

132
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,880
poll VM and deaths and the books near
thats artifact

133
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,420
for environmental the INS out trucked

134
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,430
you for us to specific resources like

135
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,050
the the Emory at Tunis process and the

136
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,710
Bucher device and budget box hair

137
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,790
and and pops and the

138
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,150
some attract a not a beer Marias

139
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,410
the by nineties and pop

140
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,870
popup killer are underestimate at

141
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,860
our easiest at pops

142
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,900
eat it is not avail spiner after BM
detection

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,459
and today mites present deadly behavior

144
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,820
if it senses analysis

145
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,450
impediment and I for example to
terminate

146
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,640
its own process and sometimes

147
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,070
executing dummy behave s to mimic
finance software

148
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,260
and I care the to connect

149
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,990
a Google Web site so

150
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,500
him out then you know and as surface get
it tomorrow there

151
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,510
activity can be crass fight into tree

152
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,530
faces Asha a

153
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,310
this breakdown fast the

154
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,650
the initialization phase a second

155
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,600
and de sculpting face and finer

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,459
and

157
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:09,059
done much just behave operates I

158
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,819
national debt scouting called is
executed

159
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,970
before domain muchas behavior on a date
name

160
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,059
my chest routine so our sole

161
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,279
ashamed that d effects host

162
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,819
don't you have shown does not cause
serious program and if tomorrow i

163
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:30,889
is executing and Shh analysis behavior

164
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,819
hair II and

165
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:38,220
as I mentioned to her video you want to
know

166
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,139
about the nicest a new team so all

167
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,519
the enteritis of pace and the

168
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,519
scouting face at doesn't matter so air

169
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,119
it the main idea a I should at

170
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:02,449
our security unnoticed law is that
Hunter Ave to make

171
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,139
must over the bay sean's all Manchus

172
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:09,429
activity after migrating

173
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,549
the modest my rehab process from D

174
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:15,860
infected host to analysis

175
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,819
embarrassment their bank dating peace

176
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:22,860
on tonight is behavior have

177
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,860
so process migration is the most
important QS

178
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:34,860
of my presentation

179
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,270
so I like to show you

180
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,360
to use guess the fast

181
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,540
is capture oath to arrive Mar there

182
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,810
in this case and the

183
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,340
and EU's executive a suspicious a

184
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,130
as a kid up I day the capture system

185
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,660
the program if it's detects ants

186
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,810
analysis behavior so many

187
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,150
mandel other artists have focused the
state's on

muchas activities hair

189
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,420
to second this case is

190
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,230
and at the best a honeypot the honeypot

191
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,280
fake attract of the target

192
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,910
host the way and the system in this a
beast

193
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,320
Tamara Mar they are is like cyber

194
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,920
esta noche so

195
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,950
next I want to talk about process
migration

196
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,080
a

197
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,520
process migration East a larry had right

198
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,350
and because it has to migrate

199
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,450
and process along this execution

200
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,830
contexts memory contexts assistant
contexts

201
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,980
and the dated Connor objects a

202
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,020
and execution environments STD

203
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,010
is also a big programming process
migration

204
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,430
and

205
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,730
by the way and you know about and better
mushing migration

206
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,040
at but your machine about your his own

207
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,500
is a sophisticated maynes all process
migration

208
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,199
as you know a skull computing

209
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,370
is our largest scared but don't PM

210
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,079
and it sorrows the source productivity

211
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
so this migration commodity hypervisor
support

212
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,529
West migration and its linebacker a lot

213
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,329
its live migration and but

214
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:57,269
the AM migration too many sources are
migrated

215
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,779
which kinda behind this

216
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,779
Mariana schists also

217
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,660
a VM social posts and the user

218
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,820
and Andrea to Inc pretty meant

219
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,019
on addition our system a

220
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,990
this increases complexity at the
criticism maintain a steady

221
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,990
and realizes costs she now

222
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,560
I we have a Sony show full lightweights

223
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,930
process migration and we use out
protests leather Sun the box

224
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,470
if you re chappie teams about

225
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,870
the process migration and we can see
that

226
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,000
as CPU I'm a data-based sandbox

227
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,810
is that must convenience and assayed
other

228
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,300
and elemental matter their analysis at

229
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,709
a CPU ended a bestseller books grab us

230
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,850
I all needed contexts for process
migration

231
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,459
at this is a comment for and migration

232
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:10,589
because some books has battered the
processes

233
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:16,550
have is gated condo object

234
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,180
prisoner got disfigure a

235
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,339
processes owned emitter OS

236
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,680
a completely embodiment dependent

237
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,350
and but acid emitter best son the books

238
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,360
provides on agreement

239
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,750
environment for ever host so

240
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,550
air it is my main idea see p.m. at the
base on the books goddess

241
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,139
enough a contexts a migration also

242
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,370
the sunday box provides a combined
environmental

243
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,509
every host hair I and the shower

244
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:01,050
the asunder books ace a good to us for
more than a racist

245
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,500
at because all my sis activity

246
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,889
and confines in the sandbox okay

249
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,110
a Lance Maria in the sandbox had us on
the books

250
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,120
suspense at Target around battery go

251
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,569
event August and now

252
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,829
a are suspended 30 days and such

253
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:40,829
and I think behavior in my area

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,379
a another sandbox see an hour lasers

255
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,139
hosts at the harassed pack to right now
they're

256
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,279
half assed a defroster some the books

257
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,589
proceed packed Maria reading

258
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:00,610
pictured of i and the morning ms and the
some contexts

259
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,319
next and the defroster

260
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,020
on pucks mara and the missed us or

261

262
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:14,829
defroster deconstruct the

263
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,370
other this gap between and

264
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,250
freeze ray yes and the books and
differences and the box

265
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,610
so the it's completely at

266
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,320
be stopped to model where

267
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,700
okay and and I did it

268
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,440
and but a migrated to marry IVF

269
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,820
probably executes unz analyzing a

270
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,950
continuously and so what's a half I

271
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,900
my system I was really needed to fight a
test

272
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,470
and stunned the books solo therefore

273
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,470
I was forced up to date my challenges

274
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,230
I would try to fight a

275
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,330
against and she said the box

276
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,860
hey now

277
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,340
nests and then on to the next point
cashier

278
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,830
a I'd like to introduce and stunned the
books

279
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,870
picnickers at but many greats

280
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,070

281
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,100
indecision and ice salt

282
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,210
the dismiss as is and

283
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,100
a show the point all Cebu and the data
based

284
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,110
and sheesh ants sandbox technique it's

285
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,610
at it you know the shower

286
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,160
and I presents dystopic at at toxic

289
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,700
as you are most interested at this topic
this shows

290
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,860
a taxonomy of unz asunder books
technique use

291
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,000
first I enter this

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,040
on Sunday books maneuver a second

293
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,860
a shirt on the books detection including

294
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,900
that duck and the better mushing
detections

295
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,860
and bust a stunning court and starring
call

296
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,700
they're going to ease a messed her up
Bahama shirts behavior

297
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,720
and the purpose over such

298
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,030
it does it cost is today the

299
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,430
execution ordinary activity wrong enough

300
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:46,130
acid at automatic analysis system rescue
about to ponder sample

301
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,090
and I know this Court is

302
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,590
a some of and

303
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,810
stunning court in and

304
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,810
its deferred to %uh paper OPP Corps
bases

305
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,990
at as CMS is this to end it at that

306
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,010
this have to have shown at a home to

307
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,480

308
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,260
fateful two stops on the books and

309
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,970
a unfortunate

fortunate today and starting called
detection and mitigation

311
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,970
already proposed in this paper a

314
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,620
it is two checks

315
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,360
all the cost environment if

316

these decorating a typical example

318
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,170
of that the video hosting a blinking

319
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,020

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,990
we find we aim and sandbox it it it it

362
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,000
a in here a I'd like to introduce a
method to pair up

363
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,690
research and in essence USENIX security

364
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,290
very interested such last published: now

365
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,790
cutting up their testing a its discover

366

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,350

aspect Oprah Tom stimulation

369
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,530

emmitt the Bahamas and development cost

372
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:40,230
okay to end this is this such

373
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,400
I I concentrate

374
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,520
own solving the debt fast approach

375
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,010
my sister has

376
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,540
a approach sees an app or disable mouth

377
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,560
and if a pic at Target the sources

378
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,130
at two avoid and some the books behavior

379
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,450
a system height some the book sedated

380
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:10,300
I talked at using dismay counties

381
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,590
up to here I have spoken out about

382
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,030
concept now let me move on

383
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,800
to implementations and a

384
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,620
our honey pot systemic using process

385
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,310
code it's a spot as sweet spots consist

386
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,410
of Tucson the books a

387
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,720
fast phrase trying this on the books

388
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,200
and the to at defrost this on the books

389
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,850
have for Israel dance

390
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,810
all end the users hosts at if she's
dicks

391
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,790
and stunned the books behavior it
suspends the target

392
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,550
Focus S and the preparing for process
migration

393
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,570
the

394
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,110
its here yep

395
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,130
be so the defroster nonce

396
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,310
beans a underwriters a environment

397
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,560
so

398
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,690
let me describe our I E a sided to

399
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,880
city and editor at I have already

400
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,430
a recipe and a database to some books
for having

401
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,710
Saudi execution in house use

402
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,190
in my company and its use a

403
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,820
for prototyping and us on the books

404
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,920

407
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,230
at the sectional facts hair

408
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,970
ended take oath and the dissolving

409
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,800
addresses and the execution and

410
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,040
in how to ask just us do not use that
old

411
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,810
so a 00 execution contexts

412
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,920
at tipped or use a random MOT outside
the box

413
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,440
it's very important

414
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,019
so are the sandbox a gust Manning
process contexts

415
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,940
animate a Allred's occasion context

417
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,559
of some books process and a

418
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,909
and do it the Sun the box Emirates some
Windows

419
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,370

of our serbia emulator hair

426
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,860
kinda really had delay interdiction

427
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,049
but in addition and the medea component

428
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,149
and then it took budget issue is not
support it a

429
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:23,370
solo

430
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,450
let me explain the the same of say spot

431
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,750
phrase I asked again nights

432
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,000
all process contexts and

433
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,630
execute our price: if a dictates
suspended

434
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,200
audio defroster

435
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,529
ministers or processes contexts from
serialized data

436
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,470
at the same time the

437
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,539
defroster constructs address mapping

438
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:55,899
so I a

439
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,059
ambition the defroster approximate as
some FBI

440
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:07,059
course fold the same are rare

441
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,260
okay and its staff is real love you

442
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,490
a nd user

443
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,140
can use like on a niche and various
software

444
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,340
fight a scan so I love

445
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,450
330 theorize process context

446
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,610
if detect and some the box behavior
caused

447
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,420
I had shown hey yes

448
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,650
the missus parks rivalry for
civilization

449
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,640
a it is a comment for C&C paper

450
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,010
data Sarah Ishan a it's developed

451
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,290
their from Japan a

452
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,350
country an ass suspends to repair

453
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,730
defines some apical and

454
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,860
now though and a gate

455
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,400
is missed it gets boring meanwhile
mission

456
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,420
gets boring name for months point at
grease fire

457
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,740
help provide and and Open Mic

458
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,380
key and I would try to

459
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,610
detect passed out in court in yet

460
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,870
Anyang to future about and not

461
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,980
implemented yet so

462
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,150
this is the sick s old

463
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,540
defrost lead now they're fast

464
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,340
and defroster untucked or process
contexts

465
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,500
at next own

466
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,660
or contexts are located in the Sun the
boxes

467
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,620
at keep area second

468
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,620
loading execute a fight and the

469
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,510
defroster runs piano the a

470
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,450
pic work order execution at the same
time

471
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,650
defroster to construct other smoking

472
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,060
so a

473
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,050
tests on the books has to my pink stove
between

474
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,010
a but about your address what's on the
books

475
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,170
and the processes the Bucher

476
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,370
other s so a migrated process contexts

477
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,560
covert a creased ideas

478
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,170
on a good otherness so a it it said

479
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,930
so different after reconstruction

480
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,290
the first 30 germs migration process
from

481
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:38,290
suspended at the section okay and I
thank you for reading

482
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,990
so I show someone demonstration this is
a simple

483
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,430
a program a it is difficult to see

484
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,680
about a this cold is 10 times come to
program

485
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,240
from deal at 29 hair

486
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,370
also a though one and integer bodies

487
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,630
ok it's or keep so the body's 11

488
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,630
had a

489
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,100
this program a if to count battery

490
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,740
a course fight s and suspicious

491
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,150
it to court I expected D okay gets
boring name for

492
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,150
at United point so don't care

493
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:29,150
okay you got this movie yeah

494
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,440
so I fast

495
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,240
a I S on some people are owned by Nina
impediment

AP a proxy inbox bone ass on the books

506
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,850
process is pretty to function so

507
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,580
dishes and in this on the books

508
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,020
so got

509
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,000
a identity so stopped

510
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and the count all fight

511
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,050
and pretty straying

512
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,320
is started and and parked

513
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,940
this program case

514
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,270
and I so-called is and a call the game

515
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,360
and now have and the program suspended
at

516
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,000
a underwriting did called okay air the
next

517
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,220
the defroster incoming

518
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,370
it's a defroster view

519
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,270
this iz analyzers embodiments

520
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,950
and you can see that the Burnham added

521
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,180
hair defiant trauma and freezing rain
here

522
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:26,140
sorry this is at the base more

523
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:32,730
so %uh defroster is arming

524
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,270
and to some pic or program hey come on

525
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:42,270
okay

526
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,380
a I did each so its Arctic

527
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,140
across my creation the so it's called

528
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,440
and process is joining

529
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,460
at after that Konkel

530
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,150
fight the defrost at a rezoning

531
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,200
and from 6 and that

532
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,220
to yet it

533
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,690
it buddies on keep so

534
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,770
process migration heavies and sheep

area key

536
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,530
hey now a

537
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,070
iraq to move on to the next subject and
epic sis

538
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,250
provides a budget resources and

539
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,250
for israeli a embankments at Oct

cell I'll I'm sorry ethnic on it in the
eighties

541
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,210
point work in progress so

542
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,930
okay next at if their proxies

543
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,260
have a descending possibilities all

544
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,880
and such and shunned boxes and essay by
spin that's

545
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,430
and fast now defroster performance

546
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,820
Bay and enough innocent miss Sun books
and

547
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,260
the end get it artifact seconds

548
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,370
a for faking attract and today I shows

549
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,840
and demonstration all to disable be in
their detection

550
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,330
on our system so all discourse in

cold get file attributes and pizza pass
all

556
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,480
and VM must've sis has a system driver

557
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,230
and and second being in our league

558
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,810
she to action Cole Niko pinky

yet up this is

561
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,600
test a row but this have court this
program announce

562
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,150
contact to at 10 have is safe

563
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,200
own Ballater hosts here

over paint one so all

568
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,870
and on DNA to at this programming and
beds

569
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:31,870
conduct routine so gay hair

570
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:32,950
so

571
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,270
air it is on the the AM be a

572
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,250
cost so are

573
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,460
though detector of the area and

574
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,040
not an ass not not up yet

575
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,730
ten-count so law

576
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,859
running vs if israhi at ok 8

577
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:03,280
captured so are its got around

578
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,740
capture the program s at all
underwriters environment

579
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,030
a of course this is on bnei

580
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:17,030
so all estimates that

581
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,370
okas that the first to start

582
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,660
vs packed and dis

583
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,040
program okay and this program being

584
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
box to life so

585
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,050
the Tang Tang

586
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:45,030
times and bring to a a

587
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:50,750
so care by the way and I showed up
relate to you

588

accurate set and so at the

601
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,180
process management is not but stressed

602
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,490

from some and

616
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,260
concept program s and that's our system
can migrate

617
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,240
process and the Jimmy there

618
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,400
