1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,850
good afternoon welcome promise
presentation about some thought of as

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,480
cation using surplus because

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,880
11 some well do both

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,040
me my name is Sebastian entry that

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,370
I'm side of feminist activists

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,410
and I have also jobs I'm walking far

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,960
a CRT into Thailand I'm doing
penetration testing

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,650
and a for in six and I'm auditing

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,570
Mumbai applications are SLT and I'm also
working for individuals

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,390
and I'm doing development for attitudes
to simplify am

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,239
attacking ways as healthy and I'm
defending with the beatles

12
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,539
so well to the problem why i'm talking

13
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,969
about up this cation I will show you

14
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,539
a small example I will take at

15
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,820
MDM application a indian agent

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,930
and M is a mobile device management
system

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,909
it's so wet to accompany to control the
security of my mind devices

18
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,600
for example it can control if devices
such a broad can all not

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,689
and if it's jailbroken the it will not
permit

20
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,630
access to business emails a thing like
that

21
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,189
some I will take one on willows a mg/m

22
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:31,189
I we'll open it in I dunno

23
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,979
I can

24
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,619
song I now it's not the right one
sovereign

25
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,810
I came

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,179
so I open at MGM agent

27
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,649
so and the petitioner which is deploying
to Mumbai device

28
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,689
and I US in this case and

29
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,740
I will try to find third child break the
texan court

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,939
one way to do that its to look for
Strings

31
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,370
so this is a list of strings

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,989
invitation and I will look for

33
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:19,079
said yeah said I is the equivalent in
the jailbreak community up the Apple App

34
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,599
Store

35
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,489
so I just typing side our and

36
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,530
iPhone things interesting

37
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,489
including device jailbroken detection
complete and things like that

38
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,650
if I look into binary

39
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,030
of my Asus training and miss either

40
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,109
it's possible to fine cross references

41
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:46,079
to find references tourists a strength
here we are

42
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,299
it's over cs3 Inc

43
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,459
and objective-c strained and again I
would it sells for cross

44
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,109
references and I found some

45
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:01,389
occurrences and the method which is
called is Chad broke and was fine

46
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:01,950
manager

47
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,790
a good candidate and I have

48
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:14,770
some court

49
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,280
I will use a Decompiler to make it I'm

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,270
clearer so apparently

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,230
this fashion is her filling an array
weasel list

52
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,590
of strings Weezer black love way

53
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,120
blackrain which is a well-known a bit
little bit or

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,850
all the better when on jailbreak a

55
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,970
accept Ross hijack citron and two if
you're looking to cart

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,050
it's a little bit complicated because
apparently is a compiler

57
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,150
this a giant I'm whiz a some profiling

58
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,690
a

59
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,060
a caught but it's not for

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,300
very difficult to understand jazz adjust

61
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,270
a maybe it's not is it to see but its
return

62
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,150
file exist a pass it just checked if the
file

63
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,370
exist on noted iterate the array whiz

64
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,280
this list of strings and if it found

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,200
a 10 for those fire it assumes south
side devices jailbroken

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,940
and to avoid this to remove this

67
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,030
you just have to patch this function to
return for such a big inning

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,270
yuri sign so binary you're ready prod

69
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,390
on your own device and the

70
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,460
that's all a York device will be

71
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,590
compliant but it will be and jailbroken

72
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,880
and I wanted to make you might

73
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,690
on jet bridge a libro injured by
detection

74
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,970
library and this is exactly is a
situation I wanted to avoid

75
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,980
it's too easy to find that I of course
it's on an example sometimes it's the

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,140
little more complex but most of the time

77
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,530
it's like that a you just so such for
some strings how you find

78
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,090
a fresh and new patch it and thought or
so

79
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:17,090
this is my motivation to do some
obfuscation

80
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,409
up I'm but his opposition I will take an
example

81
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,539
I will take an application then in my
case

82
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,749
my this application is kitty purry I
will

83
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:40,810
turkey an up escalator all and I will
apply

84
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,219
this obfuscator to my application kitty
purry

85
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,930
aunt I will see what I get to have an ID

86
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,979
now yes I get

87
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,599
and as I kitty purry it's still kitty
purry

88
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,419
I am it tiles almost the same Simon take
some %uh the same behaviour

89
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,800
props it's a little bit slower but it's
still kitty purry

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,620
it's an office skated kitty purry more
formerly the

91
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,039
about the station is a deliberate act of
creating source

92
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,069
omission cut difficult for you meant to
understand

93
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,189
for you man and not for a computer

94
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:27,189
and decided to implement my office kato
is

95
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,899
suppose Press because how else designing
a library for our US

96
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:36,219
and most of the time you right I US Code
in objective-c

97
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:40,310
and it's possible to mix objective-c

98
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,879
and see it's called object is to discuss
the

99
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,580
no I passed said or chrome you
understand and

100
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,089
and a to explain how to use a blue
spruce

101
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:58,180
to do my office kato I need to explain a
little bit

102
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,630
a

103
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,090
suppose placement %uh programming and
two businessmen to programming is based

104
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,730
on SIP displays templates

105
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,820
for example in your application you need
to start of

106
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,840
objects you have two methods push

107
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,520
and up and

108
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,200
one way to implement this without
separate list templates

109
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,610
it's like a lot to declare a class
package we just

110
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,330
to method push and pop and you other
prometo

111
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,230
object and it's a type of the object

112
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,620
is %uh voiced our it so point of two
anything

113
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,270
and

114
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,750
if you have a stack her stack of singles
you can

115
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,640
Bush Britney Spears a on to the time the
stock

116
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,700
and the shop in the last act of a POS

117
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,400
you can put a macintosh I can push and
Macintosh

118
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,430
and buzz

119
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,960
instances both object will share

120
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,510
same implementations the same class
where is the simplest list templates

121
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,380
this different I'm

122
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,570
you make small modifications to declare
a template

123
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,330
trees a tight name called T in this case

124
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,370
and you replace a type vyStar

125
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,630
by T so know you have a stack of

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,500
some precise type and

127
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,039
a I still have my a stack of singer

128
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,719
but this time it's explicit you
explicitly it explicitly clear

129
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,340
declare a stack of singer and you can
still push Britney Spears

130
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,830
and fought my stack of paper all I can
put on Macintosh

131
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,100
but in this case a

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,370
I we laughed to different
implementations

133
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,490
each object will use a different
instance

134
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,450
underclass so is

135
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,040
no code reuse in this case

136
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,300
a is possible to share some code by

137
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,570
but by default I

138
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,190
the cut is different and thanks to that
you can

139
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,880
make some optimization based on on the
type of home so

140
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,540
templates time one

141
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,480
important I aspect of super Swiss
templates

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,930
is that I you can achieve type safety

143
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,000
for example if I try

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,450
to put enable in my stack of singles

145
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,640
I we love accomplish in a row not on the
run time Mr

146
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,180
computation arrow interpreted as a first
example

147
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,570
I can put any kind of object because

148
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,060
I it was a stock of any think saw some
exception

149
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,980
you should try to put you to into IPO's
some time to talking sometimes not

150
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,200
just a a joke

151
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I don't know if it's funny or not like I
set

152
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,190
from receptors best templates you can
make optimization biz on pipes

153
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,340
and sustained on library you about the
method

154
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,029
summit Park method the

155
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,140
and the bill if and without you can

156
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,580
for example declare a class the syntax
is Arriba I would just explain a little

157
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,110
bit

158
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,920
a you have a member function in your
class

159
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,260
and I am if so tight T

160
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,660
is a pointer it will be

161
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,430
and they built if it's not a pointer
your class we not

162
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,080
contain some methods so

163
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,970
it so where to not to generate

164
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,170
caught you win generate different card

165
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,240
based on types and

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,640
missus a suppose plasma to prominence
said type of dealing with data

167
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,139
no more a

168
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,020
program arm

169
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,280
manipulating computing data in this case

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,410
you are making computing on types

171
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,940
and based on tight you can generate
different coat

172
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,460
it's a subset of citrus press it
starring complete

173
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,640
it means a two-time a for programming
language

174
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,460
it's very close to function our
programming for example you don't have

175
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,660
valuables you have to use recursion

176
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,830
are tricks like that and its part

177
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,710
officer super stressed standouts I'm
though all major announcement in

178
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,030
separate space program and

179
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,090
in the latest some letters versions
upset this press

180
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:52,090
said dispersal even and fortune and now
I was sure you

181
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,370
and that petitioners out regarding

182
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,720
obfuscation I'm in my

183
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,210
them session at the beginning to view
the city's arts is very easy to find

184
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,460
strings and what they want to do is to

185
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,620
of escaped strings missus

186
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,570
some requirement of for my obfuscation

187
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,700
I'm of course I can make up a station
manually

188
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,710
I can modify the

189
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,330
as a source court props I run a process
of something like that

190
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,420
but it's not what I want to do I

191
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,410
still want my origin are strange in my
school Scott

192
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,930
when I'm debugging I still need a

193
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,290
my origin of strength because otherwise

194
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,350
it's a nightmare to the birch and to
manage

195
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,840
if possible I prefer a from there a
buffer in the

196
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,090
friendly syntax I'm

197
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,490
and my most important in

198
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,810
release builds I don't want to see

199
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:01,860
my original strange ok is firm

200
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,320
let's make an implementation I'm
declaring in class met us trying

201
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,210
one has declared as a strict much as
almost the same zon

202
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,670
a class and I have a cost which are

203
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,090
and me as one parameter pointer

204
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,470
to a character this is my origin or
strange

205
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,930
its return const expression

206
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,300
its main that it's a method father
compiler

207
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,030
it has to be evaluated at compile-time
not

208
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,700
at runtime: and no code will be
generated

209
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,800
for this method and to store

210
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,030
my up this late this spring and in the
buffer so i didnt declaring to a bar

211
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,590
file

212
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,520
it on the rain and I will fill my buffer

213
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,890
with might confiscated string so

214
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,540
the principal ally Turkey it's too I
think each character

215
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,690
one by one I encrypt

216
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,840
it's not really an encryption its own a
position but I

217
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,480
call it and crypt I encrypt each
character

218
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,010
and I'm initialize my a rare Wis

219
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,120
this encrypt it character characters

220
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,940
and super special a burn its possible

221
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,740
to instead of dickering one temp at
Parma tell you can declare

222
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,100
several list Obama tells it's called
valedictorian plates

223
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,120
and you just put the type and three dots

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,850
and indexes in this case it's not

225
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,850
one temperamental it sir list of

226
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,300
permit us and the compiler will

227
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,010
a

228
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,260
I'm will duplicate so-called far

229
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,570
edge value in my list some

230
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,029
for example if I have arm

231
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,230
if in indexes I have zero one

232
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,329
tool it would generate this code

233
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,649
and

234
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,810
I I are also in super special even year
or so I love

235
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,880
an operator says of we use the three
dots

236
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,660
I'm its gives use a loser Lancs

237
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,210
of so

238
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,610
as a list indexes and I purse

239
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,960
I put press one to stall so

240
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,990
new rule bite at the end to come in it's
a strange

241
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,220
and from I felt implementation

242
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,060
I will use a very simple encryption
obfuscation

243
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,770
I'd just make ok so ways up could add
value fine fine for

244
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,000
and addictive Chan exact is exactly the
same

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,800
since its ok so all

246
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,240
so method in blue I evaluated at
compile-time

247
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,660
buys a compiler aunt of course during
the execution of my application

248
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,260
I need the original string so I need to
decrypts a string so I'm declaring

249
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,630
at the crypt I'm

250
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,090
method the implementation is very simple
you just iterate

251
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,120
each character you room a

252
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,230
I called the crypt and you can probe
props

253
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,010
a prime example you can replace i watch
out in the buffer

254
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,670
by so the office let it strange and
returns a bill for

255
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,530
so

256
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,370
it's rocking but I have a a small
problem

257
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,420
without yes it's a just so wat tomb

258
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,710
to call it I'm I'm declaring a micro

259
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:42,340
because a I'm this syntax

260
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,260
is not furry funny and I'm preferring

261
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,420
that so you call it this way my
implementation as a small program

262
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,530
as a problem is not a list of indexes

263
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,150
is out could it like to see in the micro

264
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,340
and as a consequence if I have more than
6

265
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,829
character else it would be too much
truncated so

266
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,920
I introduce a second russian of my
implementation

267
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,579
I will generate the list of indexes

268
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,620
02 a certain number

269
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,470
we submit our programming in the
simplest Press

270
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,610
14 as there is a star a

271
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,900
template for that indexiq once but
stressed

272
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,120
version of citrus is very new its

273
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,200
already well supported but I I prefer
out to be compatible we suppose person

274
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,490
even so I have implemented to my

275
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,460
on Vashon of index a crown Svo is
simplified

276
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,240
it's called make index and this

277
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,670
this expression

278
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,740
will generate a type indexes

279
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,080
whiz as Burma tells 01

280
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,390
exit ramp my list of indexes so

281
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,440
mowing my micro I cannot replace my

282
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,540
help to that list year by

283
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,050
make indexes and with a Lancs

284
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm just rink took on it it's

285
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,030
still the same I'm but this time

286
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,950
it's not talk truncated I still love

287
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,420
one little bit mun one little problem

288
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,140
other than the keys up for that so

289
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,560
it's not difficult to make a script to
try

290
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,620
too but false or even to that's always
55 so are you just try

291
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,350
and every binary data in

292
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,580
I'm and your opposition and you try to

293
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,340
brockville's this and to extracts they
are is no stranger

294
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,380
and to I wanted 12 a different chief or

295
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,020
each compilation a different key for
each strange

296
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,060
so I introduced a new prime minister
called K

297
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,960
and

298
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,030
a business K this key

299
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,090
us has to be generated to the randomly

300
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,010
are almost randomly so I need some

301
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,980
randomness at compile-time in super
special Evan

302
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,160
you have a rundown a

303
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,299
and a but it's only there for runtime

304
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,750
it's not for compile-time so I've I
return

305
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,570
a smaller met éireann done template
it's based on the

306
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:42,309
Lynn our commercial congressional angina
it's not a uniform distribution

307
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,510
because I'm using to murder operation
but just not very important I'm not

308
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,809
doing cryptography

309
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm doing up this cation

310
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,990
and its or reclusive template

311
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,760
and have

312
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,860
something to generate a random number
but I need to sit

313
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,980
fall this angina and

314
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,789
its something which is not so is it to
find

315
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,470
a seat at compile-time you of some

316
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,010
micros in C into Chris Preuss you off

317
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,919
for example time it's a time a look at
population

318
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,100
its the time in texts but it's not
complicated to transform

319
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,940
this into a number but if I'm using

320
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,890
only time every stranger almost there
including

321
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,000
in a stranger in my eye

322
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,330
my petition we love Michelle the same
key

323
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,570
I'm almost because

324
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,030
a

325
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,630
has a compilation may take some seconds

326
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,930
and but what I want to do to our is

327
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,880
willie a different key for is strange so

328
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm using another macro which is called
cantar

329
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,940
it's not stand 0 let's not bother the
stand up but it's Wes reported

330
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,710
I'm its report at by I'm

331
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,800
and Olivia M a I'm

332
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,930
Intel compiler else Microsoft except rap

333
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,400
and by combining time encounter

334
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,530
I'm a burn to generate a different key

335
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,140
for is strange and farted its completion

336
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,030
okay

337
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,780
discredits but is it possible to go

338
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,810
even further for example to choose

339
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,430
a different obfuscation and tourism for

340
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,960
pitched three innings and forage
compilation and to chose this

341
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,670
randomly and yes it's possible

342
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,170
I'm introducing a new parameter

343
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,170
a for algorithm and

344
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,790
much as possible with citrus press

345
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,800
this to make a

346
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,940
us what is called a

347
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,809
partial specialization upper-class so
you declares a

348
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,830
as a class Wis service prometo Anant

349
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,860
and to you sir 40

350
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,899
this is implementation

351
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:21,250
and 40 for example I will use ok saw and
41

352
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,429
I will use and as I implementation and

353
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:29,419
in this case I will just at the key X
attracts a try you can make

354
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:36,419
I'll many implementation you want and
again I will never use my mitterand I'm

355
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:39,980
to select from the only at compile-time
this

356
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,559
value and

357
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,600
I will now show use the as a result so

358
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,059
I've return a small program ways just

359
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,049
this this is without opposition

360
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,129
and this ways

361
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,899
a physician yes

362
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,840
it's bad enough I think I am so this is
what result

363
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,769
obfuscation of course into binary you
out the origin or strange

364
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,240
aunt you see its

365
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,889
just making a corner nothing to special

366
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:25,309
aunt if I look maybe

367
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:32,309
can take no I can magnify a nap

368
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:36,649
and this is my office skated

369
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,650
a

370
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,610
I'm it so using my up a skater

371
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:46,070
uses art its value

372
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,340
each character of such original stringed
as been change

373
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,610
and more interesting in interesting

374
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,900
Java mix of mode

375
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,640
mo from a coat of my of move

376
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,500
instruction ways so value a

377
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,670
I'm the compiled of us optimized

378
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,360
the initial Asia position as a buffer in
exile to smile

379
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,390
you see this is a mover

380
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,100
and this is a value the strange so

381
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,280
in the binary you don't have

382
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,270
the the large inner strength and you
don't have

383
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,470
the up this latest trendy it split into

384
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,720
different this is and miss you move

385
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,679
at the event this is

386
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,780
to the crib Shin which is executed at
runtime:

387
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,240
in this case it does selected

388
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,720
ok so you don't see your call because a

389
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,780
combined of us decided thought it's
small enough

390
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:02,780
to put it a in line

391
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,590
what time is it okay

392
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,980
I was sure you were

393
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,990
and and those application of

394
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,460
source principal this up a skater

395
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,169
sometimes I

396
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:27,730
I know that to office Kate course for
example if I'm calling the

397
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,119
and API in via of the operating system

398
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,720
to detection by a child to take tea for
the burger is

399
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,109
they're all not I'm I N I wanted to
protect this call

400
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:44,629
against static analysis and falls out

401
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:49,009
I'm using financed its machines its

402
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,499
a simplified and simple example offer
finished at mission for that

403
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:56,850
I'm so biad when

404
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,409
I'm calling a function its to put some
court

405
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:05,899
a lot of court between Sakata and a
target circus Akali

406
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,080
this is my column

407
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,429
and this is my actual call

408
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:16,629
to the target and I will

409
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:23,629
run affinis dat machine in between to
implement that

410
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,049
a

411
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,179
mmm I'm using boost met the state

412
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:32,210
mission library boost is a suppose Press
library

413
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,259
and a Reza a

414
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:38,950
lot our farm above different things

415
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,749
and that an you off different
implementation of

416
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:46,110
finished it missions what is interesting
is that

417
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,950
I'm using this kind of construction

418
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,669
Reza MPL Victor and

419
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,119
hadn't just declaring the state

420
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,690
table of my finished at Mission and to
compile

421
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,029
will generate at compile-time affinis
that mission

422
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,009
and it's a vector but it's not

423
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:13,980
a runtime Victor its a compile-time
Victor

424
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,299
its yeah it's not types

425
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,909
it's not values its types its a

426
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:24,080
I'm all this is only

427
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,659
a cross-section father compiler ever
created

428
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:32,460
only during the compilations there is no
representation without

429
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,210
a except the dark the generated code

430
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,299
I'm it's not like an array of something
like that

431
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:47,299
and I will show you as a result of this
time I mean not go into the details

432
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:52,999
of the implementation because it's far
more complex

433
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,730
site a position of strength and

434
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,999
I'm results show you as a result so I'm
this is my call

435
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,309
without a physician and

436
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:08,779
with office kitchen I have something
like that I'm

437
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:12,340
I'm you just put the surname

438
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,960
other pension as a fast Palmetto of the
office Kate idk or micro

439
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,009
and you can also combine this

440
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,190
ways a physician of strange issue of

441
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,159
strings of as prime a toss and

442
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:32,850
I was just sure lose a result a missus
ways out of the station

443
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,879
where is my my two

444
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:39,039
prometo girls and I don't have a core

445
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,490
in this case had to jump because the
compiler are decided to optimize

446
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,840
as a as a call and it does replace

447
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,190
this with a champ and I will show you in
either

448
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:58,179
as a result a whiz Affairs Commission

449
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:05,179
no it's not up

450
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:11,080
I i've made the

451
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,460
compilation with symbols otherwise

452
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,960
a

453
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,779
and so you don't see anything aunt

454
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:22,210
this is

455
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,370
a

456
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,210
the cold I have so I compile nasa
generated

457
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,630
up some some code and

458
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:37,630
if i'm looking for for my French owns a
functional trial

459
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,710
to to protect in my example it's called

460
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,710
affection to protect and

461
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,450
if I look for crossed for France's

462
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,560
to have this function I die is not able
to find it

463
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,470
the we see in the fast so

464
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,730
example with IDA South I the is able to

465
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,130
compute references across for Francis

466
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,360
a what Rock Calling and what

467
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,610
is calling you and in this case Swiss

468
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,600
is of the skater its not ever to find it
so

469
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,760
you should not a function you don't know

470
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,200
well it is called and

471
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,340
since a some a fans that mission is
executing

472
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,270
if you try to debug state by step it
will take

473
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:36,410
a long time props I can

474
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,919
sure you where it is called up

475
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,919
IP address

476
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,580
no

477
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,380
right

478
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,940
this is Mike or a and this is

479
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,419
Orvis is generated by the compiler

480
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:15,419
it iterate surf in its technician

481
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:32,810
but I can go even further I can combine
my finished at mission execution

482
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,750
Wis arm something which is a very great
a dot

483
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,660
runtime: for example akin

484
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,740
detect a debugger and

485
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,590
if a debugger is there I will follow a
different pass

486
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:53,320
in my fitness test mission this is just
an example offer finished at Mission

487
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,290
and if a salir de Burgo

488
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,610
I will go back from state

489
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,380
to to start one and if there is

490
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,660
know the burger I would go to

491
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,750
state for and I we'll effectively court
might target

492
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,060
your on the

493
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,160
from between state for and stat5

494
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,610
so if I'm go back if I go back to start
one

495
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,140
you see I'm going directly to the state

496
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,780
5 and my target

497
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,159
is not executed

498
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,820
and I have a predicate in this case it's
a

499
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,899
that the section of a debugger I can
make an

500
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:49,130
if somewhere but a prefer to office Kate

501
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,950
not to avoid if if are very easy to
patch

502
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,130
and the instead of her if

503
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,299
I will make some computer shine on so
result

504
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,570
of this predicate and I will

505
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,429
take a different path based on that in

506
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,320
the example I'm just checking if succumb
to his

507
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,809
art on not so of course I have if
somewhere

508
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:17,740
but its I then in the execution

509
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,389
Arthur finished at Mission I can go

510
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:27,669
even for also like I said just
previously

511
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:32,590
I am I dies a burly smart enough to come
to add cross-references

512
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,820
so I have to adjust to it

513
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,320
so address of my target it simple

514
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,130
I can make some computer showing Wilson
upset for example

515
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,090
and I'm I can reuse mine met éireann
done

516
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,659
template to generate this run done

517
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:52,560
I

518
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,200
Vince upset randomly at compile-time

519
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,410
each time you compile you application it
will use a different upset

520
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,840
except for its berries seminar

521
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,590
to rosa a physician of strings i'm for
the predicate tied

522
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,609
take so

523
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:16,010
example of debug other texan but it's
only

524
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,730
a an example I made a small
implementation for my quest sex

525
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,909
and I US but you can imagine

526
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,389
to detect patrol environment to to take
jailbreak

527
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,049
to detect what you on to combine this
different things

528
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,369
and to select or so this arm

529
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,519
different predicates randomly at runtime

530
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,970
and a.m. its a I'm

531
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,220
it increasing so complexity of

532
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,720
reverse engineering of course I'm not
pretending

533
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,970
South it's as a solution against reverse
engineering

534
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,299
its only an element a of a global
solution

535
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:02,990
and some world about

536
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,910
compiles to be able to use this office
cater

537
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,839
unit a

538
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:12,140
I'm a comparator which is the simplest
Chris 11

539
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,869
of 14 compliant it's a case

540
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,519
of a LLVM including April 1

541
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,810
its or so the case miss a

542
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,320
bastions of justice in whiz in town

543
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,540
but unfortunately it's not secure his

544
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,370
of Microsoft a Microsoft as a lot of
problems

545
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,780
through boxing circles plus-11 shippers
person livan

546
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,120
is a major are basham in the history of
supers process of change

547
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,050
a lot of things but sound not far

548
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,210
I'm past not checked some letters

549
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,660
to commit to preview of summer church
are

550
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,940
session of cyberspace the judge to do
'em

551
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,130
14 there is just us more detail

552
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,680
which is not watching am if they are
able to support art

553
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,950
I'm the office kato will be

554
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,370
the it would be possible to use the
office cater

555
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,460
wheeze any almost any compiler

556
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,960
I've return

557
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,340
a white paper about this week is far
more details

558
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,710
and

559
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,319
and in particular I regarding the
finished at missions

560
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:35,770
its already it's on your DVD no money

561
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,950
and its published on the determine

562
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm

563
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,680
if you have any questions if you want to
discuss about this

564
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,369
this is my treat i Kant ways my email
address

565
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,640
all the source code is

566
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,119
available on jitterbug on my i conked it
contains

567
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,420
the obfuscator it in source code of
course it's super Spurs templates

568
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,930
it's in at of ours I'm with some

569
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,710
examples you are so white paper and

570
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,720
a it's a very permissive license

571
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,369
you can use it farm an effing

572
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:21,369
including commercial products I'm

573
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:27,290
I would just sure you what it looks like
sup

574
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,850
so

575
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,410
missus a.m. in the code which is
publishing a Jetta

576
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,510
have mixed the office ditto itself and

577
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,680
so mmm and today most tuition

578
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,460
the motion is only in Maine and

579
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,260
you off different went to do with the
office kato is so different steps

580
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,300
as a different implementation

581
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,580
you see the and kept it three and
treated for

582
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,930
exactly like and I'm described during
miss presentation

583
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,850
aunt I am I ever so some

584
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,130
examples whiz surf in it states machine

585
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,590
and if I'm running

586
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:21,590
this example fine

587
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,640
come minus find vs no yes

588
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,440
I put some logs the in the same poll so
you can

589
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,680
see what happen for example uses that

590
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,310
for office trinket as selected f5

591
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,369
for the key and for exactly the same
think

592
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,700
the same you're strange another is tense

593
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,540
its one et cetera and

594
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,100
a adherent props

595
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:03,100
you don't see it

596
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,260
this is an example of my fitness that
mission with

597
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,500
the to go the texan when I'm running
inside

598
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,390
Xcode it's running under the burger so

599
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,789
I don't see anything here and

600
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:28,789
if a look at the court

601
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,820
this is a function I wanted to protect

602
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,450
and its supposed to to print out

603
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,400
pressman and if instead of

604
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,400
running it inside Xcode I'm running did
directly

605
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,060
so I have my petition my simple

606
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:05,060
duty a pic later

607
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:12,360
and this time its return pressman and I
so that

608
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,340
also says that pressman is obfuscated
itself a

609
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,010
wheeze this key if you match did a

610
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,250
really is a

611
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,070
bastion of course you don't have all the
blogs I am

612
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,920
authorize Distt

613
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,300
up his catch up okay thank you find

614
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,950
you attention and for issue of questions

615
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,970
anti-trust laws
