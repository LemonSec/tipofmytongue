1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,330
alright I yep very good morning love you

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,430
um yeah thanks for coming to our session

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,269
and entitled session identifiers of now
possible to favor

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,219
our credit could be based at you of for
all the possible adjustments them

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,369
is the bus and gonna yeah we're gonna
switch

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,330
back and forth you during the talk but
before we start next introduce ourselves

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,750
actress Eva question this is something
that kind of get the blood flowing

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,880
a early in the morning so I don't fall
asleep during my talk more talk

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,980
I'm shorthand who's using Chrome

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,270
the browser I figured as much Firefox

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,300
km Safari

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,070
still operon you like

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,149
1 percent I think the internet users and
finally

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,899
who use Internet Explorer awesome I

15
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,270
so during this talk already on the
stalking actually go away um

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,800
and think about the next door in a way
you have not thought of it before

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,030
because it's a

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,370
that will show you um yeah later on the
talk

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,610
it's actually for our attack scenarios
one of the most secure brothers

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,670
but in terms of full disclosure um

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,760
I have to be honest okay this is broken
awesome I'm

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,970
I was actually in turn with Microsoft
Research until last week the south when

23
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,030
wearing the t-shirt so if I think
anything nice about Internet Explorer

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,409
I they still owe me kind of the paycheck
I'm I think so

25
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,170
now that's that's a laugh positive
things to say about it.

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,070
okay I quickly to something about us

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,490
sorry said mines been damaged or I'm a
security researcher

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,680
on pitches in at the University Inn and
Alan in Germany

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,180
this is about the case um also PhD
student at University Mall home

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,540
and this is joint work with our
colleague martine I'm when you see how

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:44,790
of

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,060
down here um he's working for recipe
research

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,460
actually all three of us used to at some
point what recipe research in a

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,030
your distant past and with to work
together and

35
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,299
collaborate on items get

36
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,990
so about the stalk in this talk we
actually present to you the result of an

37
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,110
analysis of different

38
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,490
browsers so browser-based possum
interest we're not going to talk about

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,390
one part but of past but basically about

40
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,510
apostle managers that are the normal
user can use um

41
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,060
such as see a all of you guys just a so
its own hands

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,230
um which probably actually use and we
will then

43
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,060
are the bottom with Endemol are ya kinda
this with another as a central

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,580
on how bad they re I'm how great I ES in
comparison

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,100
um we will then go on with the study of
a footpath put his look on the web look

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,760
like on the web

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,780
which is also pretty scary on and in the
end we actually after all the scary

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,040
parts we say hey this is

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,739
to print a cure everything we actually
have a potential solution

50
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:46,070
what's the problem but before we start

51
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,530
that step a yeah back one step I

52
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,690
and a good was actually one across that
script the i'd get most of you guys know

53
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,350
but have not kept pictures on here so

54
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,730
I so wanted to the flight anyway I'm

55
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,950
the websites principal security policy
is the so-called same origin policy

56
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,440
um and the question is why can't an
attacker

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,730
say having the domain to take a dork um
read the visitor's email from

58
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,920
so if somebody that the tackle or why
can't get really really the gmail emails

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,530
and this is precisely a the same origin
policy stop

60
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,250
I'm it make sure that resource can only
have get

61
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,500
access to one another if their origins
match an origin

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,780
in the sense is defined as the protocol
soap for example aged people with https

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm the domain but this actually sup 2
may not

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,700
not to second level domain as well as
the port saw only these three things

65
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,360
match

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,480
then The Exorcist a texas' granted and
this actually

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,040
makes the job a little bit harder for an
attacker and make some very sad and also

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
has a very Sat

69
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,230
kitten in this instance so

70
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,560
cross-site scripting what is the actual
underlying problem um

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,299
webapps process data on this is a a very
obvious statement I guess

72
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,790
arm otherwise it would make sense either
way we just have her

73
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,549
kinda the web I'll as invented by by Tim
berners-lee way this half

74
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,720
content you can see it but you can
really interactive web applications

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,680
to and the state I somewhat produced or
provided by the way this might be login

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,030
credentials that might be

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,680
something you post in a in a foreign
anything like this

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,410
and basically all that actually reach
the summer by HTTP

79
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,190
which it's basically post for me tonight

80
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,840
get permit us it might even be headers
it might be yeah whatever

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,320
however a user can interact with the web
application and when medication then

82
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,450
somewhat process is this the state %uh
it might I the store it

83
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,610
or it might kind of yeah return it back
to regularly

84
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,120
think of a a search query arm where you
enter something into

85
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,230
to a search field and then website at a
youth such for your your query string

86
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,070
and then use also this kind of data not
only to reflect the SPECT you

87
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,160
but also do the search in the background
I'm so the contract with

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,950
but actually oMG if you look at this

89
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,150
little snippet update I hope we can you
can read it basically this

90
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,830
script alert one script closing election
update on

91
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,800
but its coat much because the browser it
is something to say this is the

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,100
the piece of telescopes someone I'll
yeah executed and open the

93
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,700
box and the important thing is that it's
like reinterpreted by the victim's

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,280
browser

95
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,430
in this in the context of his beloved
application

96
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,890
um that means think again about the same
origin policy

97
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,520
if I is an attacker an able to inject my
own code into gmail dot com

98
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,440
than actually I'm running in the
Argentine add a comment I can actually

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,090
reach or

100
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,940
you read your emails and yeah the idea
is

101
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,060
for so you try to find a flaw in your
application that allows you as an

102
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,470
attacker

103
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,520
that allows you to a yup put your
argument is called their

104
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,700
own job contest this in your own browser
to begin with

105
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,410
and then you somehow make the victims at
that site that money to buy it be by a

106
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:48,870
kind of

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,060
a clicky are sending them spam I'm
obviously

108
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,460
if you think about affect the profits
cryptic where this is part of the

109
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,860
I'll forget permit or something as you
all might be super long

110
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,460
so it might be very obvious I'm what you
doing but one cannot to do is

111
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,090
for example register a domain like pick
for a quick victory on

112
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,490
um post my cat pictures on it and why
the user is happy that he's watching

113
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,700
cat pictures yet you have been hidden
hidden iframe on the website

114
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,260
um that a kind of contains this URL for
the end users never wear

115
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,400
that in the background while he's
looking at cat pictures action loading

116
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,560
gmail dot com with this

117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,010
whole bunch of a of misspelled so
basically

118
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,040
in the end we can reach a get emails
okay saw

119
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,960
I

120
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,669
yes but had little or a little bit what
can a cross-site scripting attacker do

121
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,379
so the first and foremost thing you will
always see if you see a proper contact

122
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,889
proof-of-concept sorry for a cross-site
scripting exploit

123
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,030
people open up box and this is like

124
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,550
Wow and obviously kraina

125
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,120
very freaky heck of stuff I'm going on
here but actually

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,379
the attack I can do much more than just
open the ballot box he can for example

127
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,870
high-tech session that means he can
force the

128
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,300
the victim's browser to a kinda freaked
the cookie if

129
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,439
that might be involved I'm it might
force the victim to click on a link

130
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,229
for example I don't know a yellow post
something think about

131
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,189
a across the scripting on Twitter um
where you know what i'm talking

132
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,270
you're actually on I said hey that can
pick the dog in the background actually

133
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,919
the kid picks a dog sledding Twitter

134
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,090
plus this a lessen its payload

135
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,370
and then I love you posted a this is an
awesome talk going on here I'm

136
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,810
it can also be used to alter content I
don't actually a

137
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,969
case on the the German Chancellor are
the chances website where r

138
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,009
there was a closet scripting I think
what's on the search field um

139
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,129
which eventually that took some yeah Fe
content namely

140
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,169
a Johnson after resigned because of I
don't know what it was

141
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,979
somebody I think he even made it to the
new arm just because

142
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,509
yeah a it was it was actually on that on
that but

143
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,669
and you can't school blog informs and
but first and foremost and this is also

144
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:57,169
the

145
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,460
the topic of all talk this something
that typically you there's or

146
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,689
a and research and don't necessarily
think about we can actually utilize

147
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:04,759
cross-site scripting attacks

148
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,210
to see the possibilities passwords own

149
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,229
yeah so basically just to give you a
quick

150
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,319
quick overview um I think in literature
also in the security community

151
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,680
people typically peak of three different
types of profit script we actually make

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,349
a distinction

153
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,879
I kind of been on to excess um

154
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,139
we can either have client-side also a
psycho but call this the issue

155
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,459
and then we can have reflected
cross-site scripting where

156
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,630
kind of the they talked directly echoed
back to the to the user

157
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,949
all weekend of star-crossed script if
you think about a forum post and

158
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,139
except but then again

159
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,230
is a cross-site scripting like a I
hadn't been told especially with the

160
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,870
kind of security policy at the club s

161
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,499
actually it has not been so far last
year CCS

162
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:56,129
actually conducted a study um that show
that about about 10 percent all the

163
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,509
a top 10 K what sites um carry

164
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,110
a at least one bomb its cost-cutting
liberty this is a tough process good

165
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,620
thing that

166
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,449
has not be resource all that well in the
the previous years um

167
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:11,540
then again as you might know and all I
am basically all love you are a lot of

168
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:11,959
you

169
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,279
thought you use Google Chrome week ron
shipp with the cloak walter Chrysler

170
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,279
scripting on its own

171
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,009
but actually tries to detect and ya
block cross-site scripting

172
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:23,949
on but turns out that yeah basically for
all black hat US talk

173
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:28,100
a couple of months ago we showed that
about eighty percent of the domains

174
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,269
above these 10 percent all the time
because its complement

175
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,290
um are still vulnerable even if the
croats get the OTA is deployed

176
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,350
so it's not really a Canova yeah good

177
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,870
good way to to block this and this is
also

178
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,279
kinda underlined by be the white hat
security I

179
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,389
security report arm and again says Gaza
Strip hurricanes

180
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,490
the number one spot after being
overtaken by information leakage so

181
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:52,970
again

182
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,559
last year property was kinda the most
prevalent kind of

183
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,300
one ability on on the web talking and
with this

184
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,449
ok to touch over to the bathroom come
back in a minute

185
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:07,389
okay now this is working great so

186
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,639
after we now have the the foundations
that we need to understand

187
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,429
the rest of the top I would like to talk
about passwords and password managers

188
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:17,980
sobel first love about how passwords I
used on the web and then a little bit

189
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,350
how password manager work

190
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,709
and what are the security and features
the password managers have so

191
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,629
if you look at passwords on the web we
have to state that passwords are still

192
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,839
the first and the only for of

193
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,569
authentication on the web so we
basically only use passwords on the web

194
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,889
an well in a perfect world I guess we
would not have passports

195
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,240
we would have something that is more
secure it cannot be stolen that

196
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,740
we do not store in databases and so on
and so forth but

197
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,860
we still have to pass was all over the
place and well in that same I perfect

198
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,690
world where we still have passports

199
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,020
we would have a passport for each site
so

200
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,610
and the passport for for this preach
side should be

201
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,380
sufficiently complex to a wipe route for
staying in touch cracking and so on

202
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,420
but the reality looks a lot different

203
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,740
so here we see is a few statistics that
we've taken from

204
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,770
other researchers from the web and would
be

205
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,080
what we can see is dat so-what there is
such a did

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,190
he analyzed password dumps of

207
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,230
of packs that were publicly available
and check what kind possible to people

208
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,710
using

209
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,750
and what we for example see that it's a
five percent of all users

210
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,190
just use the password passport and we
have about 10 percent of the user ID was

211
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,670
password want with 123 456

212
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,750
all one the numbers I want wait and what
we also see is that

213
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,440
a lot of users use the same passport so
we compile a list of the

214
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,560
pop 1000 passports we see that

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,940
ninety-one percent of all passwords I
use

216
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,160
from that list so it's pretty easy to
crack passports

217
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,750
and in recent years we hit we saw shift
from

218
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,930
pecan Internet companies 24th more
strict a passport

219
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,740
complexity rules and is illustrated in
this comic so how so

220
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,660
if you look at Facebook and look at
Google we see that those services

221
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,310
require

222
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,970
much more complex pa Sport so we need to
use uppercase letters lower case letters

223
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,839
when YouTube have numbers and and
special chars in your password

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,310
and this makes possible very heart to

225
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,370
to remember and this i delete leaks lead
said to have

226
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,460
very in unfortunate situation people are
using passports

227
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,480
and it's not the Saini perfect world
where we have a sufficiently complex

228
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,170
passwords by recite

229
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,930
and one solution that was introduced
lately browse our password managers

230
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,580
so because password managers take the
burden of the user

231
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,060
for remembering the password but the
password manager will do this

232
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,390
and nowadays we see that all the
browsers that Ben presented in the

233
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,820
beginning

234
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,110
have password managers I did you tried
to store password

235
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,020
will see such a dialogue that says well
here would you like me to remember your

236
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,700
password

237
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,950
and with if we look at the
functionalities of such a password

238
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,500
manager

239
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,420
it has basically two

240
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,750
the first one is to store the
credentials on first the mission when

241
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,589
you see them perform

242
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,640
and I think a lot of people have looked
into how this is

243
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,940
going and if there's a secure and if no
work and can extract passport from the

244
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,310
computer and so on and so forth

245
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,750
but not a lot of people have looked at
the second functionality

246
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,390
and the second functionality is
inserting the credentials into a web

247
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,880
page

248
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,690
on a subsequent was it so when you come
back to the website for which is stored

249
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,420
password

250
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,100
it will already be filled into the form
and most of the password manager and you

251
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,730
just need

252
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,440
to click Logan and this had

253
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,180
severe consequences so we would like to
look at the second functionality

254
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,140
and we would like to look at this
situation

255
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,279
in terms of a thinking about cross-eyed
scripting

256
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,709
so here we have a an example so we have
a

257
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,480
simple login form and we have apostle
manager

258
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,760
and the password manager has a password
to start for this loving formal for this

259
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,490
origin

260
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,690
and what he does is simply feels that
porn with passport

261
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,490
and although this is implemented in the
browser

262
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,339
that could be special protections
against attacks such as cross-site

263
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:12,980
scripting

264
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,630
so we but what we see is that there is
no protection and also the

265
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,260
the way this password is entered into
the form is that the

266
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,130
the password manager just put the
password into the Document Object

267
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,190
went into the DOM took doctor command
object model

268
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,240
and well dollars good running in the
page can access

269
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,290
data that is put into it don't sewed up
the script in the page

270
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,480
is able to excess the email field and

271
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,800
as well as the password field and just
expect the password

272
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,890
and hear the excess comes in so what an
attack against through excess

273
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,270
is execution of JavaScript code in the
origin of the webpage

274
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,390
and hands he's able to extract hectic
repost

275
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,760
etc sorry execute texas ass at

276
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,500
Talisker and therefore is able to access
the password field and extract the

277
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,040
password

278
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,230
so I will demonstrate that shortly its

279
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,610
very thin very straightforward so here I
have a page

280
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,829
it's called login not calm his page not
reloading dot com but it's a page

281
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,850
on my local computer and what we see is
that I start

282
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,870
a password in that password manager and
we see that this is chrome

283
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,820
and if I reload this page chrome at all
will automatically fill in

284
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,110
at my password into the front so let's
have a look at

285
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,480
JavaScript I just opened a JavaScript
console where can execute

286
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,540
jobs to come on site like across sides
Chris

287
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,620
scripting attacker would do and would be
can just do what we can

288
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,140
select the password field so I use just
JavaScript method

289
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,100
its well-known and say well give me all
fields name password

290
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,660
and this gives me a lot note list so I
take the first element

291
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,180
and he I can see the station I could
have the password field

292
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,970
and we do not see the password in the
external but we can just

293
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,590
query the value attribute and here we
see

294
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,180
the Jalisco can access on the password
was

295
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,100
was insert it into the page were

296
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
ben says I should soon so that its

297
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,270
more with a bow yes that's a good idea

298
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,680
okay so here we can see at the password
is expected

299
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,680
on in cleartext and this is a very good
thing

300
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,760
if we think about cross-site scripting
and

301
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,320
in order to see what the security
consequences of this features are

302
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,080
I would like to compare two worlds one
world without password manager

303
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,330
and the word with password managers to
tend to your credentials

304
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,250
automatically into for so in a world
without password managers

305
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,420
XSS attacks only work

306
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,170
when the user is authenticated so what
you would like to do in excess attack

307
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,750
it would I do like to conduct state
changing actions in the name of the user

308
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,570
are you would like to steal the session
credentials so the session cookie

309
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,360
to conduct on stage injections in his
name on your computer

310
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,060
so if you conduct an XSS attack you
construct the URL with the

311
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,230
exercise payload and sanded to the
victim to execute

312
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,140
and the attack only works when the you
this authenticated

313
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,560
so it is not authenticated you cannot
conduct any stage in connections

314
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,839
and there's also no session credentials
to steal in a world with password

315
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,470
managers

316
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,069
an exercise to truck just works out of
the box

317
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,160
so the if you with a the page

318
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,960
that password manager will fill in your
password you have JavaScript execution

319
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,940
on the page as an attacker so you can
just Texas the password

320
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,860
and you can still the password and the
consequences of this

321
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,940
are very bad because on though

322
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,129
in in a world without password managers
we can just steal

323
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,970
the session credentials so the session
cookie and the session cookie is

324
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,389
only limited only valid for very limited
amount of time so as soon as the was a

325
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:53,080
lockout

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,059
or a timeout said the session
credentials are not valid anymore

327
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,409
so the attacker cannot conduct any
further actions but if you have a

328
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:01,120
password

329
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,210
stolen the attacks are limited to
lifetime

330
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,799
of a password and usually people will
not notice that they

331
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,470
they have been accessed and so you have
the password of the user

332
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,070
and the probability that is not changing
this password is this very high

333
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,789
and then another problem comes in so

334
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:22,659
poss what often reused by users on other
web pages

335
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,700
so an XSS attack on password managers do
not only

336
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,320
affect the side that the users can do
visiting aunt that

337
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,309
is wonderful to access but it will
affect all the sites

338
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:38,159
that the the password is valid for and

339
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,230
if you look at this we have to state
that well

340
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,600
the current password manager generation
makes acetate

341
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,889
XSS attacks mostly via so it's much hot
much

342
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:52,070
more easier for an attacker to do
something bad and

343
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,119
we took this as a basis for research

344
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,389
and had look at security mechanisms that
password managers

345
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:01,559
and as a spoiler we've been found a lot
of them

346
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,049
so but we did we found 5 keep each is a
password managers

347
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,369
so how their inserting credentials into
field and

348
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:14,299
we see week we will have a look at how
password managers are matching the US

349
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,299
else and performs

350
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,639
that the answer passwords into we will
look at password managers that

351
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:23,200
require user interaction before filling
in a a passport

352
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,999
and we will also look at at out a
complete attributes let's first

353
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,840
look at your own for matching another
demo

354
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,509
so

355
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,980
here we are in chrome again and I stored

356
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,169
passwords on this website so on

357
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:44,409
loading dock on flesh login PHP and

358
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,539
on this very same domain I have another
page

359
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,340
which is called search to PHP and such a
PP is a simple

360
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,889
search applications I can just put in
some value and

361
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:59,070
it it will search something for you

362
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,330
and here obviously there's a cross-site
scripting

363
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,129
so here I had user input which is
reflected in the ghetto meet and

364
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:07,789
reflected

365
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,269
in the page and I can just enter some
arbitrary

366
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,239
HTML code so for example I can just
could be so that you believe me

367
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:19,809
so we see that the code that I put into
the URLs

368
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,200
reflected in the page and now the Texas
Board

369
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,090
so let's just try to be a cross-site
scripting attacker and enter

370
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,230
form here so I just at another form

371
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,679
and I give

372
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,879
to input fields to form say just 20

373
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:43,879
I would like to have a text field and I
give it just an arbitrary name

374
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:51,880
and now I will add the password field
and just give it another

375
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,789
arbitrary name and then I sent this

376
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,789
and I see it my form and I see well
chrome isn't very intelligent so

377
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,100
just say well I have credentials stored
for long in the comm

378
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,880
here's a form it has a password kid so I
enter credentials

379
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,049
and funny thing is I can't even at
assert before

380
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,590
field just with another name and
crumbled just

381
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,470
enter and the password so chrome has no
matching rules at all

382
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,960
so just source passport and as soon as
it is a password field

383
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,840
it will enter your credentials and as a
cross-site scripting attack and now just

384
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,590
at some arbitrary JavaScript into the
euro and and just extract that password

385
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,350
from that form

386
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,539
as we have seen it before and still your
password

387
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:43,260
so here we can see a

388
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,360
small overview of brothers doing
matching of your out some forms

389
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,399
and the only browser that really does a
matching is the Internet Explorer

390
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,590
so Internet Explorer only inserts
credentials into the page to distort the

391
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,559
credentials for

392
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,909
and only into that single form and all
the other Bros just

393
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,399
filling password into any form and that
is present on the web page and it has a

394
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,169
password field

395
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,240
the next feature

396
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,860
that we that we noticed this user
interaction

397
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,190
so as we saw in chrome password not just
into

398
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,590
inserted into the page without any
wasn't actions

399
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,779
and that makes it very easy for an XSS
attack a to automate the attack

400
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,080
so just needs to send his cross the
scripting attack and

401
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,390
we received the password so we'll have
another

402
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,279
demo this time been an Internet Explorer

403
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:39,450
at ABC the same side slugging dot com
slash live in touch keep people and I

404
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,870
start a password on the site

405
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,700
in IE on if I refresh this page

406
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,990
takes away we'll see that

407
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,340
there is no password in the password
field

408
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:58,340
while what does it take so long

409
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,320
sorry for that

410
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:06,320
some local host so it should

411
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,249
mom not sure thing

412
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:15,519
Pittman not still strain lowing but

413
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,289
okay let's just wait us

414
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:23,759
you second okay

415
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,389
pap kid not sure what's going on

416
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:31,830
okay to switch to another brother

417
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,960
so adjust its fiery se VC the same side
again

418
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,350
and be with a dude with the fiery we
needed to see that there is

419
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,730
some kind of the pop-up a window

420
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,669
and we first need to click until the
password is entered into for

421
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,840
and if the form is so it can empty it
again circle

422
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,869
if I click so there's some kinda user
interaction about

423
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:58,999
so im if a cross-site scripting attacker
wants to exploit you it's not that easy

424
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,460
so he'd somehow needs to make you to
click on this thing

425
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,740
and here in Safari BC is he a very good
example

426
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,809
of a a secure using tax in because

427
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,970
this being cannot be hidden by other
things 60

428
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,960
so an attack that he could choose to
overcome this issue is clean checking

429
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,369
so you could try to to make the user
click on this thing and you could

430
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,850
try to height this window from it but in
Safari its

431
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,249
relies very good so this this part that
you see cannot be

432
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,850
the Overlake by any other by any other
side by any

433
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,450
development so that you that you have on
the page I cannot make

434
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,570
be made invisible Bice this

435
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,669
yes

436
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:47,519
it's not and I can show it I have I have
a short I say it's a very good solution

437
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,330
so in this case

438
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,820
it's not clear checkable so here we can
see it here I have a page that is called

439
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,629
even dot com

440
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:58,100
which could be used by the attacker and
he framed the the login

441
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,929
but php page from London dot com and he
concede I made a pack

442
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,350
but still so that you can concede and

443
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,360
this thing is still showing a showing up
so people will notice a dent projecting

444
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,950
this this

445
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,150
this very heart

446
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,140
okay let's have a look at the OU again
so

447
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,910
the reason why I wanted show Internet
Explorer's because at a time

448
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,960
when we conduct this research research
Internet Explorer was the only browser

449
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,730
doing that

450
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,570
so before all the brothers just filled
in the passport

451
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,950
and in the last two or three months

452
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,850
opera and also Safari changed it
behavior to show that box

453
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,070
okay

454
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,840
so let's have a look at another feature
so in 1805

455
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,980
we have a new attribute that is called
autocomplete

456
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,570
and here is some tax of the
specification and review

457
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,990
put autocomplete to text feel it s I did
two meanings

458
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,620
so it can I to be used for input fields

459
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,760
that have a particulate Ely sensitive
data

460
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,760
folks under the activation code of a
nuclear weapon says the specification

461
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,070
all you have something dat the user

462
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,600
mystery and top every time he does the
page something like

463
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,990
a for example that in a one-time
password for your banking account

464
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,800
so the autocomplete pot ok to compete at
a good

465
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,980
can be used to opt for a page 2 up out

466
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,280
of storing data in the browser see can
tell the browser

467
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,590
don't safest eight er its sensitive

468
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,120
so we had looked at

469
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,710
different browsers and if they adhere to
decide if you did you put it to the

470
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,560
password field

471
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,640
so if put to the password field brothers
shouldn't store your password

472
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,520
in there so let's have another look
again a chrome

473
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,550
have another page on this domain on is
called

474
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,680
autocomplete aunt

475
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,290
if we look at the password field it is

476
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,670
and here we have the autocomplete
attribute

477
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:06,560
and be switch it off but well chrome
simply sites well

478
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,890
even ever even if the try to to submit
the form

479
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,450
it will say yes some do you want to
start is Password Manager Pro CS

480
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,100
it will store it and it will
automatically fill

481
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,260
discern application

482
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,409
and there's an interesting %uh example
so we have a Firefox

483
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,750
and here we can see login dot PHP

484
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,360
and the login form will be automatically
felt by your password manager

485
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,110
but if we go to autocomplete we will see
but we're not you thought so it

486
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,510
it somehow tears to do all the complete
field but it still other foods that you

487
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:40,970
click

488
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,720
so if you if you have the autocomplete
feature in Firefox its

489
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,970
just switch to mode where you require
user interaction

490
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,990
and then it will again on to compete to
feel if you click so it was still stored

491
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,679
password

492
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,210
so let's have a look

493
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,610
at deal for you again so we have chrome

494
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,409
which doesn't adhere to that attributed
all we have Firefox and Safari

495
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:07,419
day somehow adhere to it because they do
not

496
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,690
out of old the password field but they
still other fill it if you

497
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:16,149
you click and then offer also does not
just here today tribute and Internet

498
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:16,770
Explorer

499
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,570
at his trade and does not offer to %ah
to complete the fields at all

500
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,620
so we report this to Google

501
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,919
so we said we we open the bobbin said
well if they are to complete his

502
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,559
present DART cookie attribute we should
not store passwords on

503
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,580
do not autofill the passports so we open
a back

504
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,039
but and put this Google and local

505
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,169
replied well this is intentional and
working as intended

506
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:47,340
so basically day do not related to
inspect

507
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,169
and does make users on somehow on

508
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:56,350
exploitable on if you look at all this
feature we see we somehow see a

509
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,720
trade-off between usability and security

510
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,240
so it would be very secure to not feel
the passwords to have

511
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,130
using tax ins where the user has to
click multiple times to white

512
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,279
attacks but I think a lot of browsers
not taking the usability route

513
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,840
so it's very convenient to the password
is in your password for Danny just

514
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,919
compress

515
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,230
the login button that you do not need to
click and I think that the autocomplete

516
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,350
I attribute is also very good example
for that

517
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,240
because if the webpage specifies
autocomplete because of

518
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,240
and your browser does not store the
password for you

519
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,509
users will play in the browser for that
it was a well chrome does not start it

520
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,709
my credentials although I would like to
start on soap

521
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,729
chrome to assess be in order the wish of
the web page do not store this

522
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:45,639
credentials and with this I would like
to hand over to bed again

523
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,649
call will talk about the state of
password fields on the web

524
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:53,379
thank you on does 18 issue 2 who

525
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,499
this cunt I actually if both

526
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:59,999
a bit all seen it in a form I set to
what it could be because of

527
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,009
then they don't storage but the

528
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,019
the notion that that I would have as a
programmer think about the following

529
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,819
have this form that was previously

530
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:12,489
I yeah the lead with the popular as
previously thought the credentials

531
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:16,279
and I want the that crimson no longer to
be stored for that field

532
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,869
then I wouldn't ago when the possible to
miss albright I said ought to be to

533
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:21,399
offer the password which means

534
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:25,999
as the specs s Europe read your brother
police don't save it

535
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:29,819
in these cases if a if there's at least
one field

536
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,359
in this form that doesn't have all the
computer to of then chrome stars and

537
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:33,919
only if

538
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,069
all of you to set to auto because of
which

539
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,569
programmers I think Google think that
programs go ahead and by accident

540
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:43,829
put autumn people of to a form and

541
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:47,109
in these cases them to help the
programmer on by a by storing the

542
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:47,679
password

543
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,709
somebody I can I mean this this blog
reported to be open both

544
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:54,679
kind of shot down on with this very
interesting other interesting comment

545
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,279
I not really commenting on the fact that
they are violating the

546
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:01,569
the specification your alright I'm

547
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,529
so enough for Google bashing again
muscle wearing my Microsoft had

548
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,960
and slight be so

549
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,480
another part of the research we did wats
want to then look at

550
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,090
what password protection look a look
like under on the web and

551
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,850
yet this sexually hum was done so we
could gain a better understanding of

552
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,190
house Heights handle these handle forms
so for example

553
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,659
how many sides are actually trying to
actively opt out of

554
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:31,960
apostle men just storing a during the
past what even if they

555
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,299
not necessary do that um so looking at
kinda feels that at all I have bought a

556
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,260
complete set to OFF

557
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm and also I for example look at the

558
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,740
the extra options header which is not a
cricket and has been a

559
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,200
to overcome by a bias he's P directive
an

560
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,250
actually the DX extreme options had a
can be set by website

561
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,570
I'm to tell the browser this this site
should not be

562
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,880
admit to never not ever be framed sorry
so I'm

563
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,929
if we think about the following think
about a yeah

564
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:05,850
a combination of RA modification I E I
he does not

565
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,360
on feel the form if it's not the exact

566
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,409
righty well so if you think back about
20 to our example we have are such field

567
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:17,840
the search field see well does not match
beef unblock in for the looking for

568
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,559
forms

569
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,010
you well so what an attacker could do is
he could use this

570
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,309
cross-site scripting on such feel to
inject an iframe

571
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:28,460
um and then try to yeah a

572
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,860
kind of got yup force the press for the
brother to

573
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,500
I'm to fill out the criminals there I'm

574
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,649
then because they are both this the such
good as well as the

575
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:42,679
login form they're the same origin the
outcome side can access the iframe in

576
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:44,130
can then access the password

577
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,500
so we also want to see how many sides
actually make sure that they're looking

578
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,110
for a page cannot be framed

579
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,950
so by by setting the DXM up to um

580
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,120
through that we implemented a very
simple crawl on which basically goals to

581
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,080
weed out some

582
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,770
from the men from this case the
electropop 4k I'm it scans the entry

583
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,250
page

584
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,669
for a look and feel on but death I get
most of you know

585
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:08,090
and not every webpage necessary has the
the login form

586
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,640
directly on the first page um so bad it
is and look for indicated keywords

587
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,710
um like a log in sign in

588
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,200
Tom on and and such we actually didn't
we only did it for for English

589
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,760
ok for his words so I'm not sure if we
call the Chinese low in points that

590
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,600
might have for

591
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,340
yeah a different than a different URL or
German

592
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,149
it's basically the same and finally a
final piece of the puzzle

593
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,549
wats that this extension that she wraps
excess

594
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:40,760
to two fields um soul that if JavaScript
actually trying to access the few

595
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,610
because this is a very interesting
things well

596
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:47,510
I'm we can notice that as well and these
are the results Offerman

597
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,580
the of the study sought in the 4000

598
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,929
what sites we actually found pass with
you it's on 2,143

599
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:58,710
and this is basically the one percent
your office this relative calm so the

600
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,620
the third column

601
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,779
um so turned on that at with even with
this relatively

602
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,130
simple approach we were able to find
properties on behalf of

603
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,700
of the electropop the 4k site I'm

604
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,109
now for the scary part um so only 38
percent of those actually had the

605
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:20,580
the form on a GPS page the snot not that
bad yet because

606
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,770
just delivering the form on a cheapy
page on

607
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,099
is well not really an issue because well
then somebody can destroy may be on the

608
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:27,609
connection

609
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,300
he with UK there's a password field but
he can't really do anything with it and

610
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:31,919
the thing that

611
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,550
scares me a case miss Kathleen Moore is
the fact that

612
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,080
56 per only 56 percent of the domains we
can talk with you on

613
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,470
actually submit news passwords over
HTTPS so almost every second page

614
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,950
actually use plain HTTP to a yup

615
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,839
transmit your passwords I to it and

616
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,690
if you think about what the boss Antonio
um users typically tend to reuse

617
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,710
passwords quite a lot

618
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,020
so it would be relatively
straightforward and easy onto

619
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,530
get yeah an apartment for a lot of
fights up just by

620
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,830
yeah being in the network and I actually
have a are yeah there's actually a

621
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,730
similar attack a model in which I will
talk about

622
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,859
in in a minute then only thirty .6
percent

623
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,849
on this website actually had the article
pizza to of I think most of them only

624
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:16,710
had a tattoo of

625
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,119
on the password field so again chrome to
sting of this

626
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,339
um still stores at nevertheless and

627
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,720
the other hand number here three in 25
to May 10th somewhat

628
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,719
summer youth

629
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,420
javascript to access this field I will
talk to you about this

630
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,499
the letter in the talk um but we see
that

631
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,439
this the either means that for example
the most of the sites likely

632
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:42,479
just wanted to check that the fuel was
not empty missiles altered Austin Texas

633
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,609
which we could detect because we have
this

634
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,930
this rapper and um so is similar to come
out to her

635
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,579
yeah when we did and l3 said they would
pay basically going on

636
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,660
Morrison perot to our research um was
not in the middle a text soul for

637
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,519
for you stick security this year um just
two do not want to go think

638
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,079
I yeah David silver at all actually
conducted

639
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,529
I'm kinda a study similar to ours but
with a different take on a month so they

640
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:11,229
went ahead

641
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:14,549
and said okay we will go to a public out
to a cafe

642
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:18,170
somewhere and offer a free WiFi service
and everybody loves three wife I'm

643
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,339
and typically use this as a free wifi
cool I'll just

644
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:24,849
click on that and be happy with it but
actually did is

645
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,479
into every HTTP connection they could
hunt so for example the

646
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:31,929
I could think was a bad example but a
any ATT connections or not

647
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:35,479
not equipped that in connection they
actually went ahead

648
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:39,140
intercepted the and the response
injected iframes

649
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,999
into the site up for example to whatever
Google Facebook

650
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:46,069
and so on and so forth um and similar

651
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:49,400
to the tech we describe the possum and I
just thought to to the login form sorry

652
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,749
the possibilities with then in these
cases um

653
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:56,439
fill out the the forms and since we have
a man in the middle attack we can kind

654
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:57,400
of put arbitrary

655
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,719
paled in this this response from
Facebook or Google

656
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,900
um so they also it kinda put from da
script in there

657
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,289
that waited similar to or attacks waited
for the possum intro to be as kind as to

658
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:09,170
fill out the forms

659
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,630
and then you get back a to the attack up
and

660
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,849
yet they did that I'm I think they had
like 10

661
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:20,469
10 I fence or something in Paris each
time user with a different HEB page that

662
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:22,429
you just can't take the next ten domains
into it

663
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:25,640
I'm and according to them it's very very
quick to automate I'm

664
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,709
your kind of sweep Rs they call a sweet
attack we just

665
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,420
sweep over the top the top one thousand
domains for example

666
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,920
and try to still have many possible as
possible I'm

667
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,910
but this is No

668
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,790
on that well thats it with no work

669
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,570
um as far as I know they didn't try to
kind of try to force SSL Certificates I

670
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,820
know for similar study where

671
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,530
I'm yep well

672
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,790
am if you think about the following and
if you don't think about an HTTPS

673
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,200
connection HDP basically lied to a
request to HD it through to Facebook com

674
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,290
with a2dp

675
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,700
am and we have a man in the middle
attack up I'm he can modify any headers

676
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,580
he wants to weaken

677
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,260
inject anything you can just injected
directly into the to the page so

678
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,640
sees Peterson doesn't help in these
cases um and there was also similar

679
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,680
study where

680
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,530
some I think a group from from other
dumb University went ahead and open to

681
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,410
open one of these

682
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,760
these public wifi and they said the user
the only prerequisite

683
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,330
and you have to worry this one thing you
have to do so you can use a wifi

684
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,380
please install the certificate which was
actually a root certificates

685
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,960
and basically allowing them to sign
arbitrary certificates

686
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,070
and so I think I'm like 90% continue the
said yes that's I want free wifi

687
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,310
again the free wifi i win for anything
you want from me because I mean also

688
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,290
it's not executed or something but it's
just a certificate 11 why no one

689
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,190
certificate can do

690
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm but young so I i kno

691
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,320
I think I are at so

692
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,120
we have these two different types of
Alphatec so we have this

693
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,370
discussed but the attacker and wonders
about to that because it's getting

694
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,130
attacker has

695
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,620
obvious the needs cross-site scripting
availability on that

696
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,160
on the target site however as we've seen
this is not a

697
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,180
yeah that that how to the task actually
I'm because

698
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,800
felt most the website a full somewhat
somewhat insecure um

699
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,460
in contrast one downside of this letter
to take a recess you

700
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,840
clearly pointed out it does not work
with https at least not the way they

701
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,800
presented their work

702
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,780
I'm whereas again didn't the crisis
gripping category have Nexus S on edge

703
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,950
DPS page we can

704
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,120
doesn't go through the password from
there um but

705
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,410
and this is one case where the netbook
Asus the their way more

706
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,100
yet sophisticated and powerful than we
are. he can't just eavesdrop on the

707
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,270
crimson that have been posted to the
website so again

708
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,730
half of all the password fields are
actually submitted

709
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,220
by ATP staff H

710
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,220
guess for some reason I'd don't want to
understand um

711
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,070
so summarizing this actually attacks
against Pablo managers can relative it

712
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,380
can be the ultimate

713
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,400
um so but I love this is

714
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,609
the deep apostle managers and lets that
fear

715
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,890
you're not talk about a year not again
the opossum Angeles

716
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,609
in browsers are not really secure this
might be a different story for for these

717
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:19,109
these plug-ins like of parts and and and
1password

718
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:23,220
but we have to think about a although I
guess most of you here

719
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,599
will not necessarily use the built-in
pop-up managers because well you're

720
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,740
your security where up people on the
interrelated

721
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,320
typically are not that security where to
put it mildly for the big and say hey

722
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,090
this is there's a feature on my brother
that

723
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,740
allows me to not remember my password
awesome I'll just use that why should I

724
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,349
buy something or is that something that

725
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:43,880
I don't have the technical knowledge
actually I text reuse

726
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,430
and in our work we found that yeah we
have

727
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,090
issues related to all kinds of think so
we have this all to finish you

728
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,349
well basically or browse the site you
get it say hey there's password field or

729
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,270
if only I just

730
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,240
a display my password here I'm some of
them ignore autocomplete

731
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,760
on at least partially I'm there is no
verification that it's actually still

732
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,970
the login form so we can use for Mrs

733
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,640
names instead of whatever you send the
password but also for us as an attack a

734
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,510
very easy to

735
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,410
can inject this Alberto reform with two
very generic form into any web site and

736
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,470
want to we want to steal

737
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,849
credentials from so the question is

738
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:21,630
and this is a not the end of the the
attack part basically

739
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,810
can we come up with something that might
be better solution

740
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,369
that can still be deployed in kind of
quality browsers

741
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,760
um we don't have to report yeah
basically the hope of a miniature

742
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,859
I'm as well as don't have to force the

743
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:39,099
yeah the the user's the untrained youth
to learn how to tackle the problem into

744
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:39,849
the data click

745
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:43,720
and sewn into force okay

746
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,750
so what we've seen in our research is

747
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,380
the the idea of what a possum and should
do is it should

748
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,540
H user an authentication so too store
securely store

749
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,820
the passwords and if they are needed by
the replication he should then kind of

750
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,290
a provide them to the publication so the
user can authenticate

751
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,180
I'm and our notion authentication is the
credentials are being sent to the top

752
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
but this is actually

753
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,040
when you authenticate against the server
however as we've seen

754
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,450
and they're somewhat of a mismatch in
this notion and the implementation of it

755
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,140
so be credentialed are at some point
into the summer but

756
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,610
most importantly before that actually
happens they are inserted into forms

757
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,830
and therefore inside to the Document
Object Model and

758
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,860
acceptable by by JavaScript or across
its cryptic pale across the trip the

759
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,280
papal

760
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,230
and we just propose well let's try to

761
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,520
align this implementation how done in in
browsers

762
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,350
with this notion I of York rather than
being sent to the cell

763
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,970
alright so I'm a part of this

764
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,970
the slide it is he the the way
possibilities well-written also

765
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,440
initially we find a login form

766
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,910
than the path a manager comes along
against the page find say that the login

767
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,330
form

768
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,340
so I'll just go ahead and then search my
the username the password that I start

769
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,470
for the side and when the you then click
on sign in

770
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,650
this possible is actually sent to the
server

771
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,180
but so this this this is obviously what
we talked about all this the stock

772
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,660
I'm we now propose the following instead
of the possum in a jar directly

773
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,850
inserting username and password

774
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,980
let's go ahead and enter the username
and inserts

775
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,960
some pseudo-random nonce into this field
with this months

776
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,200
the attack occurred to absolutely
nothing this is just

777
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,990
so that the possum injure has away of
kinda figuring out okay

778
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,859
month XP lost password why and what
actually happens is

779
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:36,220
if we now click on Submit since we're in
the browser

780
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,270
we see this outgoing request with you
the name in the months

781
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,730
the nonce can be of any format so that
we can actually easily detected in the

782
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,840
in the outgoing request

783
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,670
am and that it can also be there by
accidental just give them something very

784
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,190
long

785
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,280
well the path a manner that does this it
has gone at to pay their season and as

786
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,320
possible at this month's

787
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,369
so let's exchange the nonce with with
the

788
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:59,410
password there are some contract
constraints this approach

789
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,519
soul potential pitfalls for for this

790
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,279
would be what if in the tech ago the hat
you can use he says cross site scripting

791
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:07,249
capabilities

792
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:11,440
he change the forms target so instead of
posting it to

793
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,230
lookin dot com slash lookin PHP he
actually posted to attack outcome

794
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,910
our evil look on a yeah jump PHP arm

795
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,779
another way of going about this would be
for example to

796
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:26,819
a yep of the two such PHP we've seen
that before

797
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:30,730
um and think about the following we
still in this this scenario where

798
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,240
um the attacker has XSS on on some site
he has

799
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,200
this iframe on that points to the login
page he just modify its

800
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,569
the I'm the target of the login page

801
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:45,180
its sent after the the possum out as a

802
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,299
entered the credentials and now this
such PHP reflects back

803
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:53,430
what it was given right I'm what you can
now do because he still kind of has

804
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,839
control over this parent frame

805
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,960
which is a lot excess because they're on
the same margin to this

806
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,329
to this iframe he can then kinda read
the content of the search page

807
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:04,609
I which affect the back the password and
could install the past

808
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:08,269
I'm an attacker could also go ahead and
just change the the method

809
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:12,269
number is used to post social send the
form sorry from post to get

810
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:16,239
get means that all the para meterse
although the fuel from the password and

811
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,140
the form sorry

812
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,529
are kinda appended s you get para
meterse

813
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:24,130
so again he post the form and then just
REITs the

814
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,480
a Bulo of the of the page that was

815
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,759
the has not been a redirected to and
then yes

816
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:33,819
kinda eight years and I'm Department and
the public at permit and can therefore

817
00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:34,569
expect

818
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:38,749
so we therefore propose the the
following constraints: there should be a

819
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:40,119
very strict checking of

820
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,720
the form Parker 20 um so that the techa
cannot

821
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,130
it cannot change this this at all and
also we propose only to exchange these

822
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:48,749
monsters

823
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:52,849
and post by Madison ever and get her
meters I'm

824
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:55,880
we implemented a proof-of-concept
implementation

825
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,700
for for Firefox this is due to the fact
that Firefox I have a very nice

826
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,329
API that allows you to interact with a
possible 100 so you can exchange topic

827
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,079
and each stuff

828
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,740
I'm just from extension so

829
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,400
we still have this this default the I
can kind of them

830
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,180
question and if that you'll be asked do
you want to do you want me to remember

831
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,730
the password this is the first stage

832
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,530
um if you did yes remember the password
this actually go through the password

833
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,119
manager

834
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,040
um and in the parliament we have a call
back that said that kind of

835
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,590
then is called when a new password is
entered and thus a

836
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,840
then cause our extension let me wrote I
with this information for which host for

837
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,400
the torch

838
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,840
for with you that was its already fall
to form a trio I'll I'm and what was the

839
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,380
password

840
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,790
and what we do then is basically we
start this secret password in our

841
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,660
database we generate around months

842
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,619
and Exchange a man exchange the the
credentials they were initially be

843
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:47,880
stored in the bottom in interest

844
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,650
with our nonce and the learning so
therefore the path we still use the

845
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,860
default password manager but rather than
storing

846
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,630
poss was it not to stores these is
nonsense that we can week and access

847
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,200
later on

848
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,260
arm palaces the tricky treat sorry for
that

849
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,310
um so yeah this is certainly example of
how it then

850
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,990
a goals along 13 arm 13 post

851
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,740
long forms on the apartment for it very
small I'm gonna post login PHP and thus

852
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,670
this month

853
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,800
on is there in the in the daytime so in
the post data

854
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,920
um our extension verify said look at pH
Peets actually

855
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,100
the page that this possible to do that
with this possibles originally Posted to

856
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,080
so it is OK I would exchange that wears
on the lower part which is he opposed to

857
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,880
such PHP which might reflect back this
password

858
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,410
in this case our extensive checks hey
login PHP is month such PHP

859
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,450
so I will not a insert the path with
your

860
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:44,510
with ended a functional evaluation on
this on his work number 23 and 25 to

861
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,640
main street singer Leo

862
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,160
um that somehow you will start yeah a
Tosca to access the

863
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,800
attacked the public feels sought almost
130 on the cement actually

864
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,350
yet this one had an checked whether
there was some possible are they are not

865
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,930
if you clicked kinda submit or login
without the pop up in there that this is

866
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,390
not putting a you don't have

867
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,570
don't tried to send us this form if you
don't have the password

868
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,740
I'm ninety six domains

869
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,670
hutchison to the password by our X mejor
to be requests rather than posting this

870
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,110
form

871
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,530
I'm and I love those a key 23 to mange

872
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,640
hash the possible before sending it out
you think about

873
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,550
the effectively incident rather than
inserting a possibly be entered this

874
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,080
month's

875
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,800
he has two months we have no way of
seeing it on the on the outgoing request

876
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,590
because big picture don't know what kind
of hash function is being used

877
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,340
um soul in these cases are
implementation breaks because

878
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,650
the pathogens that the nonce announces
hashed and doesn't match the password is

879
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,690
stolen the Somerset

880
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:43,850
I'm one domain for some reason went
waiting way out of its way to be

881
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,200
super secure and use the bay 64
according

882
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,619
arm or encryption I think they called it
I

883
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:54,510
again this causes issues if you because
you

884
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:59,530
value base64 encrypt about the month and
and six domains are those actually send

885
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,190
passwords and get para meterse

886
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,530
its own folder thirty of these two men
to be looked at would break

887
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:08,790
with our approach which means that 98 96
percent of all the domains we analyze

888
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,040
would work perfectly fine

889
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,660
but what we propose and also more
importantly actually storing passwords

890
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,500
for

891
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,640
for the tex-mex in LA cheapy requests is
currently not

892
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,760
supported by browsers because brothers
wait for a can afford to be submitted to

893
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,810
so basically a post or get request but
that isn't

894
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,250
initiated by this this form submit an
XHR is not a

895
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,810
not a form submit okay then

896
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,910
I concluding what to take away from the
stalk

897
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,990
um so the current generation of
browser-based problem is quite

898
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:38,560
vulnerable

899
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,820
and even if the most of you and now i
can say this because

900
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,270
and yeah slowly where taking off my my
Microsoft had

901
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,500
I'm not a big fan of IU on for several
reasons

902
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,350
I'm but although most people kind of
hate it and say this is under the really

903
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,030
bad brother

904
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,400
in this instance that actually very very
secure um

905
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,490
then a very shocking nothing that we
found is but almost half of the possible

906
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,090
thanks to post by HCP

907
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:08,260
arm which is yeah met make the top for
an attacker report ever take it by using

908
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,070
because you can just go ahead and turn

909
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:14,180
yup read those from that without the
request and at least again to cross the

910
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,540
scripting attack a week and we can do
something so we can

911
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,750
actually patch relatively easy Pet

912
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,490
existing a in browser solutions arm

913
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,620
to allow for these a yet will offer for
defending against East is kind of tax

914
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,440
I'm its hard against never take a what
we can do is

915
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,740
for example enforce the password should
always be are yes and buy a GPS

916
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,280
rather than HDPE but then again we wit
theory break of the

917
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,820
other websites okay and with that I'd
like to thank you very much

918
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,120
for your attention you want to take a
picture I and we're happy to take any

919
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:47,970
questions you might have

920
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:54,970
me to put the pac

921
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,400
a picture back on I think we will put
those lights on our domain

922
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,920
which is here cut crack soft the ever
time comes at the end

923
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,920
there's a question

924
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,680
and actually there is so this initial

925
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,740
I research we conducted wall so I think
we did kinda and a fan of last year

926
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:28,270
and way let me quickly go back to that
slides

927
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:31,490
lookbook all

928
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,130
I sus screwed up

929
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,700
the this one came on

930
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,470
yes I as an example a this I I think the

931
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,680
initially with Safari 7.7 point all
which

932
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,040
and didn't have your a texan all 7 1/2
human interaction for

933
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,369
for chrome we did the initial a tests
kind of with chrome 31 I think now we're

934
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,690
up to 37 my belief

935
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,240
I'm so they are why the bro this change
um

936
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,690
they actually become somewhat more
secure I can really say for Papa right

937
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:04,950
now

938
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:08,060
I don't know that on the top of my head
but I you with all with 11 I

939
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:13,570
I mean if so weekend

940
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:20,570
yep

941
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,380
up okay so

942
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,910
okay so so your question is basically

943
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,310
a while we looked at how old how they
behave

944
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:38,950
a we didn't really with a we didn't we
analyze how they hold securely they

945
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,000
store the passport

946
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,510
because there has been a lot of reset
going on before on into this

947
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,730
I am I could be say I think I know
something about

948
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:51,090
Firefox I'm but I me by default none
actually have

949
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,790
apostle is that secured a keychain so
you have to accept a

950
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:58,260
XD know what you doing to add kinda
pasta protected York

951
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,950
to your keychain or are you pop a mentor
passengers database

952
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,890
so there's just nothing there I think
it's also depends on the operating

953
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,240
system for example in in Mac OS

954
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,800
a most of the WebKit browsers used to
keep chain of

955
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,120
of Mac OS so distorted possible securely
in there and by the mother operating

956
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,800
system its

957
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:22,800
it's different

958
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:30,330
in Syriac cake

959
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:36,340
wound

960
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,230
okay so it's all that's what you're
saying is the

961
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:44,250
a we propose to use this kind of as a
proxy where whisper so this month

962
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,830
but I was too good in theory excess the
outgoing request

963
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,300
but actually this kind of mangling the
outgoing request

964
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,510
is done inside and also after the form
submitted

965
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,940
would ask it has no way of accessing the
page and more so it's

966
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,270
the request is already outgoing and
JavaScript to see the game

967
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,290
might notice there's a request going out
a.m.

968
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,070
but actually have no way of kind of
accessing this mango

969
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:12,300
request that we that we did so it's it's
a curious

970
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,560
so it's it's currently not possible to

971
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,270
to access the request on the way to the
server for jobs but there's something

972
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,070
that caught service workers weaken

973
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:26,010
install java script to to request but I
think this happening before

974
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,710
so so we are sitting in the browser much
in on a much deeper level than

975
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:36,710
been top

976
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,309
me

977
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:55,760
but only

978
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,589
extensions yep so not not in jobs good
running a web page

979
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:03,650
I the big sexy extensions are basically
Dallas kept

980
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,380
but they are kinda running as an
extension and the browser back and

981
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,150
rather than

982
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:11,599
something you can access from the from
the website so there's no excess towards

983
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,140
extensions well this sometimes but

984
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:18,170
a that he do crack extension to begin
with good
