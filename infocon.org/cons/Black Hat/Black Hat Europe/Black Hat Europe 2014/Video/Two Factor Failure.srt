1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,500
hello everyone good morning I my name's
Ryan Lackey I work for Cloud Player a

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,139
cd&e does mitigation company I'm
speaking a black hair Europe 2040

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,150
so just a quick disclaimer I my employer
does offer customer two-factor

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,550
authentication for website

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,710
I we use internally because a PCI much
other reasons

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,320
we're not a two-factor authentication
vendor I personally hope you like

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,689
consulting in helping out friends people
adopt two factor authentication

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,010
and I think it has serious issues but
also very useful tool

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,149
I'm just a quick back going to let me
i've I work in startups and and security

10
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,610
for about 20 years now Iran offshore
data here in the North Sea called Haven

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,570
co back in

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,649
2003 anonymous like gonna catch stuff
before

13
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,140
defense contracting satellite stuff in
Iraq and Afghanistan

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,420
and now I have trusted computing startup
for a while they got bought by

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,510
Cloud Player earlier this year so the
next 25 minutes we're gonna cover

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,460
quite a bit material a quick overview of
what two-factor authentication is

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,899
than it should be obvious to everyone
here I strengths and weaknesses were

18
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,969
changed over time

19
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,680
there were some assumptions made when
two factor authentication was first

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,430
introduced

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,540
that aren't really true anymore and
things have been adopted over the years

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,460
our bill is a true

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,159
how the threat to all the overtime and
into major weaknesses into factor of the

24
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,490
two-factor authentication and advice
best practice and future goals to do to

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,470
best implement this

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,700
so what is two factor authentication
former more properly multi-factor

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,540
authentication

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,729
at choosy two or more independent
factors for authentication chosen from

29
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:28,829
at least 10

30
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,750
to us at so knowledge factors like
passwords knowledge-based authentication

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,470
question things like that

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,600
a possession a physical topiary or

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,530
effectively a data files protected by
some sort of does control mechanism

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,470
or inherent something that user is a
biometric or some other potential it

35
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,399
inherently user

36
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,899
the star has a pretty long history

37
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:53,060
I'm I'm this stuff before this but
credit cards have a signature

38
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,040
verification

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,770
on the under the same time as a mag
stripe I'm extra cards to pay any such

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,840
as an ATM card

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,259
and then password plus the cloud and the
check so if you're at a checkpoint in

42
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,630
the check your ID plus they ask a word
of the day

43
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,440
that would also be a two-factor form for
the publication to has a long history

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,070
has a long history failures I signature
checking for things like credit cards

45
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,510
always been kind of a joke

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,950
you can write a line to use for
after-the-fact trend analysis and for

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,120
some legal things but

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,370
doesn't really protect you from time
abuse attacks almost all cases

49
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,990
the ATM in the same way perhaps it's a
little bit stronger but we have people

50
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,830
who put their pens on the cars we have

51
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,470
scammers all across devices customers
being this is crazy huge industry now

52
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,500
and in documents like you can just show
up with the

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,080
pretty much anybody photo of you match
some basic parameters problem maybe

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,600
thirty or forty data points

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,460
I'm for 30 or 40 a.m. it's a her brother
no more that Miley

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,920
like six to 10 better information you
can pass muster as

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,890
the clean there's things like us totally
fake authentication credential these are

58
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,820
camouflage passports the people use

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,180
better for countries that don't actually
exist you're not carrying like a a

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,230
a fraudulent document because it's our
country that never existed

61
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,770
I'm from leo is one other seal and from
for back in the day

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,460
but so this is another thing but these
are the physical world versions of these

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,960
things

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,630
we've had two factor authentication
computer systems for a long time

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,830
others ASCII OP the old security tokens
the the offline devices

66
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,670
these probably have seen them since the
early 2000's there are some in the late

67
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,340
90's

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,700
the else I think I guess is HP's nothing
so you've had two factor authentication

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,870
at least in the enterprise environment
or in the system environment for

70
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,510
for quite a long time the they would

71
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,260
to date rates they were really useful
they were generally disconnected they

72
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,239
were offline

73
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,540
they were physically distinct from the
protected system they weren't on the

74
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,350
same system

75
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,820
and they had some negatives they were
difficult to implement

76
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,450
I you end up with a major problem some
the biggest problem I personally had

77
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,050
with stuff like this we ended up with

78
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,209
like a different to factor of hoping for
every one of your accounts they can be

79
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,050
bank accounts a good basis and accounts

80
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,510
the remote overall accounts at work
agree all such a crazy stuff and you end

81
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,900
up with like a bag for tokens are caring
for tokens which is pretty crazy

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,910
the another exciting thing happened

83
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,940
the a little while ago I am

84
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,120
river is a retard one of these tokens
the i-four here this file

85
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,110
for you to review please open to it on
the Rs a security breach

86
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,250
obviously where the sea there was used a
lot it opens was extracted and various

87
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,100
targets were

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,550
compromises an attack are the result of
the attack so

89
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,590
yet there's that so this or a motivated
whole shift towards of tokens

90
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,780
a.m. they have a lot of advantages a
cheaper easier than ever basically an

91
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,490
eraser security control the easiest
possible way to implement it is

92
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,440
ultimately you know when

93
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,060
and these were a lot easier to implement
lot easier to manage a lot easier to

94
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,730
reissued in the physical tokens were

95
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,750
I and it's all those problems like
having ten different opens because you

96
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,670
sound different

97
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,760
entries in your girl authenticator your
other authentication ap

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,540
I'm which is pretty cool the and about
the same time PC I was pushing people

99
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,780
toward implementing

100
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,580
up to factor for a lot of applications
the

101
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,440
are some issues with how it's been done
but we're just over really quickly PCI

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,110
2.0 the me to first after this and

103
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,480
it doesn't really it's not really very
specific about what you want

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,590
and it's not really terribly the
thorough so

105
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,330
with this year potentially could have
one or two users verify

106
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,690
use it for certain remote access I so
there's that

107
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,840
3.0 fix this to some extent I requires
effectively a random sample abusers be

108
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,260
verified and

109
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,280
on as a result you end up with with all
users have to be verified

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,760
and it's it's a Muse from or
implications

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,740
as this but there's still a problem at
all really designer on road access till

112
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not critical systems so if you got
critical systems at work

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,790
the the river in scope it on a silly
need for access locally don't need to

114
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,540
have for

115
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,790
two-factor authentication and of course
your Jessica E

116
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,950
difference but the and there's not
really very specific guidance on to

117
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,140
factor I mean PCI generals fairly

118
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,450
in a little about how detailed it is but
I think this is an area where could

119
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,360
do with being a little bit more specific
about the controls that are acceptable

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,460
on the type to to factor in the title
applications any protected

121
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,790
and specific I guidance about one dollar
tourism showing should be included

122
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,940
so then also in this to factor of

123
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,960
the softer can land there was a push to
using SMS and call based authentication

124
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,090
because not everyone has smart phones
are not everyone on the

125
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,080
not all especially france for consumer
applications not everyone had a

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,930
smartphone and the other applications
were generous carbon-based

127
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,360
so either in addition to or in place
love

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,680
a time a cash-based one-time pad
one-time password authentication on the

129
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,450
the sit on the smartphone the providers
provided this SMS or call based

130
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,220
authentication

131
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,940
and there's a problem here it's not
really great photo by Google Voice

132
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,810
allows you to forward your SMS to

133
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,920
voicemail so a lot of configurations
people have this

134
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,970
this kind of thing configurator SMS is
for their services shared

135
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,830
their voicemail shared otherwise
vulnerable so you got done

136
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,980
call forwarding as a vulnerability on a
buncha

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,470
normal configuration take things which
are one thing to worry about but then

138
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,300
there's the

139
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,380
the problem both now work now we're all
very very quickly once

140
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,200
a SMS and Email and calls where the

141
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,360
primary means a passing out especially
banking credentials which are used by

142
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,140
large numbers of users especially in
Europe and Asia

143
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,290
a so the

144
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,480
there's been like put a limit on this is
just a short summary of some of the

145
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,100
the attacks on our Design just to still
SMS's and call in addition

146
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,390
Commission for it some more so something
sorta close to me was a

147
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,840
the hit the CEO of my company actually
fell prey to this personal attack before

148
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,770
I joined the company

149
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,360
the collapse had a password recovery
mechanism like therefore different

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,169
some security flaws at all chained
together led to his personal Gmail being

151
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,860
compromised which led to a Twitter
account being compromised

152
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,040
which led to a Bulls in prison for some
people so

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,050
I'm yeah another

154
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,040
only great two-factor be technique or
technology people using their smart

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,570
cards

156
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,930
I exciting news from fighter Alliance
particularly as coming recently but

157
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,760
smart cards especially like the I think
cell phones and the

158
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,320
for me in the enterprise the DOD CAC
card with a common axis credential

159
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,289
were really the the best

160
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,289
the access control type model so this
the

161
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,000
the CAC with the smart card readers was
deployed pretty much across the

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,269
DOD and throughout other parts of the
security part the US government

163
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,370
and allows their readers there's real
from blackberry to pair with Bluetooth

164
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,449
there is a

165
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,509
Russia spark our readers on your come
laptop in your keyword everything else

166
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,230
generally will interface with Microsoft
Application actor directory to

167
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,709
to log into systems and was written
reasonably secure the

168
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,639
it unfortunately I don't really help if
is now this whole system doesn't

169
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,069
register now running on the host

170
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,959
being protected because the
authentication happens right there and

171
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,130
the smart card doesn't have any direct
user i/o

172
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,230
so as a result now whereas that was
targeting a specific things

173
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,600
the more so for banking but there have
been

174
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,860
the banking ones are more widely
discussed because they're

175
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,389
consumer-facing and have large numbers
of users so it needs regulatory issues

176
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,160
the enterprise targeted attacks on on
spark arrestor occasionally

177
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,649
are generally not as widely discussed
because they target interest rate is

178
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:32,730
people in the enterprise

179
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,079
another whole category of course
biometrics a.m.

180
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,889
anything from fingerprint to Iris to
retin-a to hand geometry to

181
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,680
various other things their first got
some issues the readers themselves

182
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,029
usually expensive though this is falling
dramatically I

183
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,019
doesn't really help you when something
is running on the track and host again

184
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,510
and you can't reassure you

185
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,430
the uniting with all the other kinds are
potentials as if something does happen

186
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,550
in your ok you can reassure the
credential

187
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,529
but changing your eyeball outside over
the Total Recall and things like that is

188
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:02,389
not really a

189
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:05,399
a viable strategy and has a lot of the
user pushed back so

190
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,190
I there's a problem there on it's
something that that was

191
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,600
very interesting was the touch ID for
the iPhone 5 with

192
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,149
both CCC and when my colleagues mark
Rogers were able to compromise I think

193
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,560
within like a day everything out

194
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,889
and using very simple stuff using some
some

195
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,420
PC board and elmer's glue and

196
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,980
there's that so yeah it's a biometric
sir

197
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,709
a great in a lot of ways but they read
every be deployed in over a secure

198
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,279
system and for consumer website
authentication they're really not a

199
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,100
viable solution

200
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,130
treasury may change this and to make
change over time we have

201
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,170
Apple pay launching soon we should be an
interesting application is this the

202
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,269
consumer space but

203
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,290
think that's pretty much watch the space
and and then there's another

204
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,579
interesting for it to factory that the
the smartphone clients things like

205
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:51,290
Google authenticator very things like
that

206
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,329
but now you have softer base to that
effect authentication I

207
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,399
freely without the and there's several
other cities

208
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,920
there you to implement is local software
that runs on the host

209
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,980
or they are implemented as the also is
local suffering host but like a browser

210
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,880
extension this case a Chrome extension

211
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,180
um and they effectively implemented TOTP
rejected the client

212
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,380
but it's running on the same

213
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,930
user usually say machine everything else
as the project application

214
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,459
I and as we see all these things
together have throughout

215
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:26,160
one coming from whether to come problems
is there not independent factors a

216
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,279
compromise the host

217
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,750
you compromise the two-factor
authentication device all the malware

218
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,860
that sits there

219
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,149
am no matter how strong the the director
of mechanism is

220
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,720
if he can impersonate user it it wins

221
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,519
and you end up with really to

222
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,189
root causes this you have data and
authentication that are running on the

223
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:46,959
same device

224
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,910
you have something like the the TOTP
happening in the same browser that's

225
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,470
running all your other codes at the
browsers averted you lose

226
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,139
order it something unintentional where
you have something like your

227
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,930
multiple devices are paired in different
levels at different places where the

228
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,639
user wasn't expecting repaired

229
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,939
one of the most stunning appealing and
interesting for me

230
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:10,559
unfortunately wealthy responsible for
everything else um

231
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,100
is paired mobile devices so you have
something like an iPhone pair to your

232
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,089
he to Mac or if you've got an Android
device you have the backups

233
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,209
I you end up basically trusting both
devices at the same level

234
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,810
and trusts or it doesn't go up till it
goes downhill so

235
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,850
you can cialis prix excitingly the

236
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,759
Sienna before device backup sync just
below the money device extract the key

237
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,250
is

238
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,319
and with a.m. with especially the iPhone
we found in Ohio s

239
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:43,250
haven't tried this yet on how estate but
I was seven before large amounts of the

240
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,610
I'm data and backups was not crafted
this was

241
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,819
doesn't start his work so you can
extract a lot a really interesting data

242
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,290
from the

243
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,790
the backups often are not crippled at
their own local this is well its initial

244
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,310
option

245
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,940
or they're going through the pass for
the store and user I'm caring so I am

246
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,000
is that and some backups to use
knowledge portable storage

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,610
and but not all the new and there's also
applications that allow you to do cloud

248
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,370
recovery which

249
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,480
a think sorta breaks the assumption oath
to factor of the two separate vice

250
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
the so there's been too much for texting
attacks on this

251
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,529
some so far p I don't really know the
best way to summarize them because

252
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,810
they're actually fairly diverse but
they're all

253
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,490
basically man in the middle the
attacking the device 32 now where

254
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,240
lot of cases out just right now where
that's evolved over time to add

255
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,500
a small SMS catcher component that runs
on mobile

256
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,819
or it's just an hour's been ported a
mobile on

257
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,470
specifically with the goal is health
stealing credentials but

258
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,779
the arm the real problem with that is
that

259
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,459
he used to be have a computer it take
your computer with you wanna multi city

260
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,680
trip or whatever you do work on a
computer you have your phone use that

261
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,339
for your second or occasional vice

262
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,529
but I know a lot of people now the
travel with just a phone or with iPhone

263
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:00,350
and iPad

264
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,230
and or just with an iPad or whatever
else and there's an

265
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,439
really no difference there's no second
device they can use so

266
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,720
this assumption you have to fully
independent advice is that aren't paired

267
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,459
anyway

268
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,860
is not really a great assumption anymore
us there that will put that aside for a

269
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,339
second

270
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,470
there's another exciting area oath of
compromise the people have been

271
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,759
exploiting since at least

272
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,240
the

273
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,000
2012 publicly and pretty much before
that like it's been an ongoing thing

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,360
is that basically this stuff is is
grafted onto existing code a

275
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,000
under existing systems it's not many
many many cases PCI people say

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,660
you need to have to factor of the soul
enterprise clients because a PCI

277
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,790
and so somebody has an existing AAA
system and they decided

278
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,589
oh we quickly need to implement
two-factor how can we do the minimum

279
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:46,430
amount of work

280
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,430
to implement two factors they bolted
onto the front door

281
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,149
leaving all these other unprotected
areas of the application I don't

282
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:54,230
actually is to factor

283
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,290
a lot of reasons why they do that one it
is quick time to market

284
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,569
and what it is they don't really think
through the consequences of it

285
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,600
thing is there's a lot of cases where
there's a very restricted user interface

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,870
from available to the other applications
either because it's somebody else's code

287
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,019
that they're facing with

288
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,899
it's something like the Google
multi-factor that needs to work with the

289
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,970
sixty existing male clients that only
have a feel for password

290
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,500
or some other system like that where
there is no really had an extra

291
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,970
additional steps and they have to
grafted onto the existing stop I

292
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,310
or things where the form factor the
device or the interaction is very

293
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,370
painful to the user implementing
additional codes

294
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,689
it could be a device that doesn't have a
good key or terminal server keyword

295
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:32,779
display or anything on it

296
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,740
and and also it's really the the things
that people don't look at so much that

297
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,120
they get compromised it's the infrequent
things like account recovery

298
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,259
special users internal users a lot of
internal systems and not going to factor

299
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,720
while the external systems do

300
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,569
the and things like that so so those are
really interesting places to look

301
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:54,689
and a lot of people looking as areas p

302
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:58,089
so everyone from

303
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,600
min do it's been incredibly active in a
sealed they're looking at a pellicle

304
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,829
I'm I think they're probably the the
leaders in finding two-factor bypasses

305
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,420
to this particular technique but

306
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,240
there is a teenager who found a
vulnerability in pickles well so

307
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,980
it's not really I'm only the curfew
people are doing it

308
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,339
and these are only people disclosing is
publicly and responsibly there's plenty

309
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:20,829
of people who have from

310
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,629
is a very cookie-cutter take a taxi can
just go after any API for

311
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:29,029
I'm lot of services and look at the
features that are

312
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,259
either infrequent like things that need
characteristics are described

313
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,160
I

314
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,370
the things that are either infrequently
used internally is I'm

315
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,810
restricted in what they can where they
can have the passwords things like that

316
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,870
I'm one of the most interesting things
people seen as the

317
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,259
the Google's publications are passwords
or training people to think that there

318
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,220
they're like these passwords are in some
way restricted but therefore casper's

319
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,920
need a full access to the account so

320
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,250
there's sort of a mismatch between user
the

321
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,829
belief about what the system does and
what this system actually

322
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,490
implements I and yet the the duo guys
found the

323
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,579
exciting Pay Pal mobility using this
this is the hope that they look into

324
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,270
so who thought they looked and i saw
they resist this little air

325
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,189
that said that certain is the
application weren't supporting two

326
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,220
factors so

327
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,270
it was a good place to look so if you
look back at them little bit you can

328
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,740
there's a lot of places they're really
innocent

329
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,959
around fortunately there's an

330
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,309
people who believe more in responsible
disclosure and I do that

331
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,140
have encourage me not to do certain
things so your the

332
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,820
so the the what were the consequences

333
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,669
all the stuff I we will reevaluate
whether two factors are actually

334
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:39,679
independent of each other

335
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,380
and it doesn't do you too much good to
put your on

336
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,980
authentication application in the same
place as you're protected area

337
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,549
I and then there's the home our threat
basically any system that could be on

338
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:52,450
the road now where

339
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,340
if it's attractive enough is going to be
10 the the most interesting things about

340
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,220
this it's usually banking applications
which usually do vary by country

341
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,000
so for instance I know the US banking
applications for the banks I use

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,940
relatively well because there's a part
two of them but I'm not really like the

343
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,500
Indonesian banking system worth their
various

344
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,970
systems out there and I think it's very
unlikely that on

345
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,750
counter malware systems are going to
stay up on all the secondary and

346
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,840
tertiary market

347
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,960
a.m. banking applications in as real
time as people come to the threat so

348
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,559
that's a

349
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,070
constant area to attack and people need
to redesign their system so multi-factor

350
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,710
authentication is inherent in the system

351
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,600
so make sure that every single for
authentication goes to the same

352
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,880
authentication pathway

353
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,690
and don't leave these is like getting
back towards the doctor had rotation

354
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,159
system

355
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,460
there's a lot of things to do work
incredibly well though come

356
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,680
application-specific to factor of
Facebook and Twitter have done a great

357
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,900
job working in both

358
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,460
a.m. where the application itself passes
credentials back and forth

359
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,520
I devices to take multiple inputs is a
really really interesting idea

360
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,010
is that your device actually or you're
protected application is constantly

361
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,820
evaluating

362
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,880
the security printers both on the
environment

363
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,330
which is operating if it see something
abnormal it will require heightened

364
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,150
authentication

365
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,530
purses /a in normal operation mode and a
great example this is on mobile we have

366
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,120
a very restricted user interface

367
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,440
and users want to be able to implement a
rare billion put a very small

368
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,570
pass code each time the user device the

369
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,000
maybe if the device has been unused for
long periods time you want

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,600
a more secure past raise it has a
shorter one or

371
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,860
if you are if the device has been put in
a very bagger some very things like that

372
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,460
various indicators that will show if the
device is a heightened state of alert

373
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,670
and Amazon is a great example this they
allow some very low

374
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,690
risk interactions to operate with very
little authentication using like all

375
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,090
cookies and various other things

376
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,300
but if you want to review your account
history or change payment mechanism

377
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,820
something like that they require height
level the publication

378
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,400
the physical of communication devices
that do have direct you I

379
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,630
things that help keep has things that
have the displays for transaction

380
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,880
details it seems especially the vacant
space a big one is really exciting

381
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,170
for a lot of reasons some even if you
don't believe in it as a payment system

382
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,860
anything else

383
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,510
its really the cutting edge out now
where attacking you right now

384
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,250
because he you have like final
settlement on the resort to attack can

385
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,860
you have got an early so the problem
with attacking traditional banking

386
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,870
systems is

387
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,270
is still may go to jail after the fact
and get caught with big when you have

388
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,520
pretty good chances are both doing a
theft without being caught

389
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,820
so or selling pot after the fact so

390
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,510
a a lot of these devices are now showing
your site

391
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,040
but the Tresor device the shows on the
transaction to be details on it

392
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,230
things that have direct user input
direct is our hope that they will show

393
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,090
transaction details that are specific to
the transaction so you don't know where

394
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,660
compromise your machine fully

395
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,960
you can verify that the transaction that
you this happening is the crack

396
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
transaction

397
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,010
offer the device in it secured in and
then you have

398
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,950
out a band notifications one other

399
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,510
the really obvious in retrospect but not
really obvious to people in the building

400
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,590
systems is that

401
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,980
a lot of his actions are themselves
reversible especially banking

402
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,830
transactions

403
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,860
so an attacker usually compromises has
been a certain point in time

404
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,040
does not pertain control system for ever
and release the user has some

405
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,870
chance if they they can do something
later so what you do is use and delayed

406
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,680
notifications use and

407
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,470
delayed authentication request things
like that out a band I love you's a

408
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,680
rollback transaction

409
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,850
but one of the most exciting things out
there is actually client OS protected

410
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,430
storage

411
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:30,430
the as I said earlier the a mobile but
people moving toward mobile platforms is

412
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,970
a serious

413
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,420
risk for this because it eliminates this
potentially use them as a second from a

414
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,200
publication

415
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,170
however um the advantages they actually
have a relatively good security model

416
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,010
compared to most desktop operating
systems

417
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,660
particularly on the harbor protection
from I work in prosecuting for a long

418
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,790
time that's a great

419
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,780
come gold gold how this is russia
meeting on the desktop but I think we're

420
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,260
still a ways away there's some

421
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,590
great work going on there but it's the
compared the iPhone where there's

422
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,290
trusted computing

423
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,670
very much by default on every iPhone the
it a long ways to go

424
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,220
so X Lion on client certs are really
interesting technology that

425
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,550
have been around now for like the twenty
years and

426
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,660
haven't from little less than 20 years
but haven't really

427
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,980
caught on for two reasons browser UI
issues on dust-up

428
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,750
and the lack the protective storage
because it's just a local file your

429
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,290
system

430
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,050
so on mobile that's no longer really
sure you have local project in storage

431
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,490
for things like client certs

432
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,730
and you have browser UI that's actually
pretty good forum

433
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,180
for how it handles them clio for how it
handles these

434
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,570
for sure anything so I would say that in
the case re not going to happen how to

435
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,370
ban device during authentication

436
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,900
we're showing the transaction detail
showing you I'm pen input in everything

437
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,380
else

438
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,960
you can get this essentially all the
advantage of traditional to factor of

439
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,500
using

440
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,350
TOTP HRDP

441
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,510
I'm client everything else just lazing
client certs hmmm

442
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,419
so there's some usability to finish
their so either exciter face

443
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,929
some usability you get the same me a
better security or you

444
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,660
he could have roughly the same a.m.
security and get a lot better usability

445
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,240
them so those are is an interesting
things but yeah unfortunately the

446
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,669
the couple love and areas where one
could poke at certain API's and get some

447
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,970
really interesting stuff are them that I
am in the Middle Earth

448
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,570
and hearty process on so I'll be happy
to questions

449
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,669
if anyone has questions

450
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:33,350
point B

451
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:40,350
E

452
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:53,639
it

453
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,489
ok thank you very much the pics
