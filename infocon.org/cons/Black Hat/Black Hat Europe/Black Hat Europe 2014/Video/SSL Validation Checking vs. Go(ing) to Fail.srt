1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,509
alright good morning everybody %uh I'm
glad to see that

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,570
so many people have made it here already
including myself

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,160
although it's still quite early in the
morning be

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,660
I was guessing yesterday that play kid

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,970
intentionally moved the away the
conference from the center so they make

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,820
sure that

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,380
speakers don't get wasted so much a
morty

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,750
k so my presentation will be about

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,420
SSL validation shaking I

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,260
while talk about the presentation is
it's a little

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,030
close to the famous at Apple Park go to
fail

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,270
and give you some ideas about the
research that we did

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,420
a along with that topic from this

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,550
go to feel even ability we developed an
idea of how to

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,789
test for as a validation checks

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,390
in a tree also create a prototype that
we of course

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,219
applied to a bunch of different
applications as well as a speak about

18
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,630
the actual results that we achieved
without prototype I am

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,869
great value about myself I guess I'm I

20
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:12,530
mostly known for their I worked at it so
far

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,020
in the industrial security we all die
spent a decade with a large German

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,360
industrial mentor

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,759
now was hitting the air hey proof
Products Group

24
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,750
and eventually also founder of their
product third

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,970
but for quite some time I'm doing my own
thing now

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,390
running a small %uh security consulting
company called like security

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,400
also focusing on secure software
development and industrial security in

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,740
my

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,630
first professional life my second
professional life and a professor at

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,530
University back in Australia where I
really like to teach classes like a

31
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,689
web and application security botnet and
honey pots

32
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,189
and penetration testing nonetheless in
both worlds

33
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:56,549
my research interests is industrial
security and application robustness

34
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,219
which

35
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,610
brings us back to this topic so what
does

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,750
the background for the research so I
guess all of you who have

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,400
and

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,130
Apple devices have read this security by
10 about the security content of IOUs

39
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,290
706 if we go through it it says
something like he has a problem with

40
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,730
data security and taken with privileged
member position may capture a modified

41
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,310
beta

42
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,310
in sessions protected by SSL TLS

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,670
so when I was reading this I was
thinking oh boy this is really already

44
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,680
the worst case and then it came even
better

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,710
secure transport fate to validate

46
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,890
the authenticity of the connection what
that this means ole

47
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,990
if you're in the end it now i dnt rice

48
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,990
then you would not be able to actually
tell

49
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,430
if the validation of the SSL TLS
connection

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,970
ahead really hadn't properly so in in my
opinion this is really the worst case

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,610
of the worst case righty so question was

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,270
I what was wrong in doubles as a
so-called at that point

53
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,310
so the actual phone ability happened in
the

54
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,370
as a key exchange don't see part which
is of course as you would guess

55
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,970
the official as a little less library
that Apple uses

56
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,870
what happens in there is just a regular
steps that

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,670
you would expect to take place when it
comes to ssl/tls

58
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,730
connection setup I the functional
process the client a low of course also

59
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,890
the summer hello

60
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,890
and at some point this certificate and
initiate

61
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,310
the key exchange especially for Gilles
connection we on for its secrecy is

62
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,190
involved I want to spend a minute on
forward secrecy

63
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll wise forward secrecy a good thing
why should everybody in this room

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,780
love forward secrecy I if you haven't
heard about it

65
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,820
police keep close attention perfect
forward secrecy is really nice because

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,010
if a bad guy breaks into your web server
or maybe a

67
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,180
foreign agency which legally claims to
be authorized to hack your server

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,180
on get the server key they cannot be
crypt

69
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,690
traffic and they have captured at some
point in the past

70
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,040
why because individual session he's have
been

71
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,900
have been

72
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,728
just so that's why everybody especially
since

73
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:21,530
2013 should love forward secrecy so the
problem actually happened

74
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,680
in the C function called as assailant
verify signs over key exchange

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,350
and if you look quite closely into the
source code

76
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,560
even if you're not familiar with
programming in C

77
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,380
you see to go two phases in the middle
of this

78
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,680
so I am it looks a little strange

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,320
or what's the problem here obviously the
first fatal

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,710
is really correctly pound to an if
statement

81
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,560
but the second wasn't what does this
mean from

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
a program flow or logic perspective I

83
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,270
so there's again I think can only guess
what should have happened so

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,860
the code should have calculate that
they're a cryptographic check sums

85
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,830
and then past those on to a function
called

86
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,349
SS and role verify for the actual
verification process

87
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:14,020
if the SS and roll verify a function
sexiest in the air a value

88
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,360
that we had and appeared

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
should have been 0 which is quite calmly
meaning

90
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,770
no air on that's what the function users
to signal everything's good

91
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,419
proceed with the connection the problem
he really was

92
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,039
that the very first go to faded that we
sold

93
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,770
if that sexy that hmmm this mandate

94
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,620
there has been a probing and the air is
non-zero and the connection

95
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,010
wouldn't continue right in sea of course

96
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,729
at the second go to feel always happens

97
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,789
a if the first one doesn't so the result
was

98
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,729
that the cold jumped all with different
calls and

99
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,139
in the end is the consequence was that
the fall

100
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,860
SSL validation process didn't take place
so several checks just didn't

101
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,520
and just didn't go through the ultimate
consequence so

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,710
different ideas so generally the
validation wasn't working properly

103
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,880
maybe the link between the funeral key
and certificate chain

104
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,370
was propane it might have been possible
to send a

105
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,000
correct certificate chain declined but
signed with

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,950
wrong private key or not at all I maybe
also

107
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,990
there would be no proof that the so
actually processes the private key

108
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,660
mention the public Ian its

109
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,660
the certificate I'll but

110
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,810
its previous straightforward users
wouldn't have received

111
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,780
any of those typical warning messages
when there's forged certificates around

112
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,710
and thereby making men in the middle a
text probably easier

113
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,200
so we are really thinking how is it
possible that the critical security back

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,870
in security function

115
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,600
when unnoticed for quite a long time
could it have been detected

116
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,190
sorry could have been detected probably
yes

117
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,200
if you have to source code I am I mean

118
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,470
by using the source code scanner be I'm
pretty convinced you could find his I

119
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,800
was even thinking

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,480
and if you could have just the founded
for looking at the compiler messages

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,490
so it's quite some time since I did a
bunch of C coding

122
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,010
but they remember whenever I did
something wrong with the coding and they

123
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,870
created coat that had some errors in a
logical branches and a conditional

124
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,000
statements

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,800
which would end up in some coat that was
never jumped to

126
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,350
the compiler with issue at least a
morning message so with the source code

127
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,680
probably this could have been to take it
period if the source code was not

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,500
available

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,880
mean maybe I am so

130
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,640
our research question and that was it
actually is a go to phil was really the

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,630
starting point

132
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,229
I was to which degree can

133
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:54,190
SSL validation checks of third-party app
speed

134
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,540
systematically assessed if the source
code is not a real

135
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,979
initiated to do an assessment like this
of course what is the overall

136
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,630
a state of as as a validation checks
especially when it comes to mobile app

137
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,540
so the question we are asking was

138
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,010
are doing mobile application developers

139
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,229
the right things are they doing their
homework correctly

140
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,729
I'll when they include as a cell
function because they have to transport

141
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,900
confidential data at the using it the
right way

142
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,410
and this led to our as as a validation
father concept and I picture

143
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,650
what do you want to do again come up
with a methodology which allows us to

144
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,370
test whether this is a late addition
checks are done

145
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,770
properly in mobile applications without
the source code

146
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,490
from that concept of course created tool
which helps us to automate

147
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,550
certain steps to test the quite a number
of steps I

148
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,090
easily and we're also thinking okay once
we have these tools it up what might be

149
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,610
good

150
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,670
candidates for testing

151
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,030
our tool and of course we thought in the
first place about

152
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,160
you banking and more buy leads why a

153
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,410
because at least in my home country
Noster and has been a a huge

154
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,850
around on promoting more by the banking
from your smartphone

155
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,080
on the one hand and on the other hand we
just thought

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,190
I the financial sector has quite high
confidentiality requirements and data

157
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,230
security requirements

158
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,350
so those guys should really do their
homework properly

159
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,360
and finally we want also to Jake the
same application under three different

160
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,980
I major mobile platforms Windows Phone

161
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,320
I US & Noble and see if there's may be
different patterns

162
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,450
so what we really mean assessment
components

163
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,690
I'm the main assessment components on
the client side you're just a regular

164
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,310
mobile equipment

165
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,050
like Samsung Galaxy s2 running and a
rate

166
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,000
412 an Apple iPhone 5 and the Nokia
Lumia running

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,590
how Windows Phone me on the softer side
but we had a modified version of fun

168
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,720
MITM proxy those of you who are already
into penetration testing

169
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,980
know the softer it's a really really
good piece of social for doing man in

170
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,900
the middle it takes

171
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,380
it's an open source a softer that we

172
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,130
modified to interface 20 as El
validation father

173
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,980
and finally of course the I

174
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,920
passing component as such what I'd like
to point out at this point

175
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,130
is p whether or not doing is

176
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,000
fuzzing the as this L library so we're
not facing

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,480
open as this as the in start as is and
what they were

178
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,500
there's other companies and groups doing
research at this what we wanted to test

179
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,740
NSS was really the validation components
really is this software developer

180
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,140
using BS is a library in the right way

181
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,930
what was the setup I

182
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,510
and architectural are a component so on
the right side

183
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,350
now we had our poor clients and rate

184
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,180
windows and iPhone there are connected
through a regular wireless network

185
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,470
and to our evil proxy then

186
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,890
most importance of two components here
were I B tables DNS mouse

187
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,330
Mika in proxy a certificate authority
because we

188
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,150
ahead our own certificate authority for
some test cases

189
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,160
end RSL a certificate father and finally
of course

190
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,340
connection all ports to the internet
because again we want to get

191
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,580
into the middle of the connection why
did we have to set up

192
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,060
well I'll we started out differently he
started out but just to entering a proxy

193
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,100
configuration

194
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,910
into the a

195
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,430
mobile device and thereby trying to
force

196
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,120
the some the mobile app to talk over or

197
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,420
proxy the funny thing was some

198
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,210
of the mobile banking applications
complaint so they say

199
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,280
hey I did take did you have a proxy
configuration

200
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,160
there's a hate security risks I will not
work so I found this interesting does

201
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,210
this and some security

202
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,800
probably not so what did we do just that
move the proxy configuration

203
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,870
out a on the network and to the redirect
to a proxy on the network side

204
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,820
throughout the tables and then of course

205
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,040
the applications been complaining morial

206
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,200
the K what does the testing approach

207
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,310
so what you want to do really is more
target oriented

208
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,730
a fuzzing of the as a lil validation

209
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,120
component so the process was that our
application was really tried to

210
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,180
I E it really tried to connect the

211
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,650
out to the Internet and

212
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,380
a tried to reach out to the server and

213
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,970
from the server of course we will pull
the initial service certificate

214
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,540
through our many middle proxy posit on
to our fussing component

215
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,810
and generate a bunch of new are
certificates

216
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,520
which are somewhat close to the original
certificate

217
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,860
that's also possible for some of the
test cases that's throughout the reason

218
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,970
why we needed our own

219
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,870
a certificate authority so the idea was
really

220
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,870
to think about how might a software
developer

221
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,060
have checked for the presence of the
right I

222
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,760
SSL certificate I'm

223
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,910
so test cases we had to think about test
cases but

224
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,760
which ones actually to make sense so we
also thought how twisted Ken

225
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,100
a the developers mind be what could he

226
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,800
check for from an SSL certificate
perspective so maybe something without

227
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,870
maybe some developer really shakes

228
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,390
hardcoded the certificate serial number

229
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,690
actually we found that stat3 true

230
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,840
but the majority of our test cases
really is just

231
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,280
based on the regular X 509

232
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,530
standard certificate fields so something
like

233
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:03,420
a hostname I the ability debates invalid
not after in millet not before

234
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,450
so our original first test case was case
number two

235
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,860
a valid certificate what we mean by this
this was a certificate that we

236
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,900
generated with our own CA I

237
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,910
which was I marked trusted on the device

238
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,930
butthead really nothing to do with the
original

239
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,290
I with the original certificate what did
you want to check by this we also want

240
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,950
to Jake

241
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,730
how widespread I'm certificate pinning

242
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,760
is used already so that's that i think
is a typical pinning is quite an

243
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,780
interesting approach

244
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,360
and we thought maybe for this for this
application field it's a good thing

245
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,390
um at some point we had a
misconfiguration

246
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,600
and we ended up I with our proxy just
sending some

247
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,850
random certificate I which was not
marked

248
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,630
trust state which has just some
snake-oil information in the air

249
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,510
and actually some application some more
by banking at three Li

250
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,540
accepted the certificate I so we
wouldn't have

251
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,090
we wouldn't have started with this test
case and in the beginning

252
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,270
but it really work alt so we kept the
test case right

253
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,420
um so b-side

254
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,540
the regular test cases they do derive
just from the

255
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,420
X 59 standard certificate fields we also
found it

256
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,050
I am worthwhile to look not only for
certificate pinning but also for

257
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,460
s as stripping I'm as as tripping

258
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,540
to the make a long story short this
really

259
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,400
I a way of being able to preventing an
encryption taking place

260
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,900
so think about the banking application
trying to

261
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,680
I trying to connect to server may be
starting up with regulations impede

262
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,420
traffic

263
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,780
and then trying to create a

264
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,590
I SSL connection by reaching out to a
resource

265
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,340
that the station TBS protected if you
are

266
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,510
Enoteca in the middle I love this
connection

267
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,730
and implement the implementation is done
the wrong way

268
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,520
you're able to redirect this request for
an encrypted at

269
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,650
resource just to another website which
is

270
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,050
may be a very good fishing site and
therefore preventing

271
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,800
the actual security connect the actual
secure connection from

272
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,890
Eva taking place I and this is also
something that unfortunately some

273
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,420
banking app sarra no

274
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,960
run the road to so I have eighty short

275
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,510
I have a short with you I hope it works

276
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,320
so we have been application on the right
side

277
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,550
I didn't shy I didn't want to show the
actual banking

278
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,610
I logo what did we inject here

279
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,790
they very evil lime security company
logo

280
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,890
so we are of course able to get into the
connection but this just HTTP

281
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,050
now our user clicks into creeks into the
mobile banking

282
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,280
and encrypt it connection should take
place this

283
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,300
is very very close resemble to the
original

284
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,689
I website again for demo purposes we put
intentionally our company logo there

285
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,329
and on the I lower

286
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,980
a on the lower side of the screen you
see of course already

287
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,689
the login information the pin that ten
whatever is needed

288
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,120
by a the the user to log onto the
website and then of course we just

289
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,740
redirect to the regular

290
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,290
I banking application so this is this is
by the way

291
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,360
and an Austrian bank but those guys if
you are lucky already started to fix

292
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,990
this so

293
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,200
a the funniest thing was that we just

294
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,770
started by looking at the regular
certificate fields but over time we

295
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,150
found

296
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,120
other test cases like as as as stripping
which I really the

297
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,700
not related to the X 509 stand up but we
also found really really

298
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,450
growth while to talk about and to
include in our research

299
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,180
so what about the results until

300
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,260
I beginning of August we had something
like

301
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,390
ninety applications test it so we
started all with national Austrian banks

302
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,470
I moved over to Germany and then went to
China

303
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,230
to India US bank so those overall ninety
applications

304
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,320
that we tested I'm the bad news

305
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,670
about the results so probably debate use
for you

306
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,730
I know everybody loves one abilities but
we have

307
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,120
I made agreements with the bank's that
those who have not fixed them and that's

308
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,330
quite a bunch of them

309
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,830
I

310
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,440
mmm yeah we won't name anybody not on
the positive side

311
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,679
not on the negative side but still I was
surprised

312
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,640
even in 2014 they're still several ABZ

313
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,140
both the European and international
banks regardless of the company size

314
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,260
that do not comply any validation
shaking

315
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,630
I to appear SSL connection and that
therefore really susceptible

316
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,010
to chess the default man in the middle
it takes from

317
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,840
let's say around 2,000 so this is what I
would consider a total fail

318
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,240
at least in the financial industry we
also found of course

319
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,570
several lower degrees of fun validation
some maps were

320
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,260
as I said so skeptical too as as
tripping also making many middle it

321
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,779
takes

322
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,389
easier for fishing purposes for example

323
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:22,889
we also looked at how widely deployed
ages the SS

324
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:27,500
so HDPE streak Transport Security some
of you may know it from

325
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,480
browsers of course I it's not as widely
used as I expected

326
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,350
also talking about pools the pool gonna
be too which came around just this week

327
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,950
we did a very quick test just two days
ago how many of the

328
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,580
service i'd counterparts of our banking
applications

329
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,149
would be configured to talk as a
celebration at three in the

330
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,519
problematic CBC mode yes there was quite
a bunch of them so of

331
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,620
the thirty wheat estate I think at least
15 were talking eyes elevations been

332
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,350
in CBC and I think in this case this
could be prevented

333
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,730
why I think the people reluctance to
change

334
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,019
from SSL versions 3 the are reluctant
only because

335
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:16,380
of legacy clients like Internet Explorer
6

336
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,899
this is not the case here why because
you do have

337
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:23,769
the client on the you control your the
bank rolling out dog handing out the

338
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:24,580
client

339
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,019
today mobile users so you do not have to
worry about

340
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,610
any ancient broza right we also found

341
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,110
some interesting results some
applications newest

342
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,679
other band TCP connections for whatever
reasons

343
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,240
not only as is and is also plane takes
to

344
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,830
other fantasy be connections beside the
SSL connection

345
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,330
some helps transmitted quite the punch
of device state

346
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:55,970
which ya maybe rises privacy concerns so
I have one example from the papal at

347
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,360
I am I think that's a legitimate purpose

348
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,780
but I still find it interesting to see
something like

349
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,720
the device identify I'm from the sim
serial number the subscriber ID

350
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,429
the geolocation their friends if it's if
it's jailbreak

351
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:20,429
are not but I am I wasn't aware what
kind of data is being sent

352
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,280
from I from the mall by so that's why I
think the purpose

353
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,200
is really fraud detection or risk
detection that's why I

354
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,500
data like this is being sent but
nonetheless i think is really both right

355
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,330
from time to time to peak into

356
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,760
the data that is being sent um

357
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,670
from your applications out to the
Internet the good news

358
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,960
well likely several banking payment app
sexist the

359
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,250
which to apply all as the cell
validation checks

360
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,350
as you would expect a really
state-of-the-art

361
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,410
homework probably done even certificate
been in place

362
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,440
I as a set the next line

363
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,290
in some cases you do fine certificate
pinning now in talking to banks

364
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,250
it was most of the time more on the
enjoyed sides

365
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,610
wide because on the endurance I it those
guys have

366
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,650
head issues already with banking Trojans

367
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,030
doing exactly the same thing as we have
been doing bringing their own

368
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,080
certificate authority with them

369
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,770
installing into the device the storage
and then being able to type

370
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,300
into their mobile connections also

371
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,330
I if the developers use their provided
validation functions

372
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,570
I the platform provided validation
functions the results

373
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,770
look much much more better than if
home-grown crypto and validation

374
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,570
functions are you so

375
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,070
and not a big surprise same here so

376
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,530
what should you take away from this talk
assessing SSL a validation checks

377
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,330
over third-party app is possible I think
to a good

378
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,570
the treaty even without the source code
I think it's very important to do so

379
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,950
because it's quite common to pope you
were to buy a third-party applications

380
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,029
from somewhere else and you really wanna
know if the protective measures

381
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:12,539
in there are working or not even in 2014
the banking sector as is lol addition

382
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:15,730
checking is not properly done in all
cases

383
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,990
I and probably the bad guys have also
figured out where it's worthwhile

384
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,380
locally to exploit this so we also so
some

385
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,600
yeah local I areas

386
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
where we found the banking applications
to be more insecure than others

387
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,370
and in the end of course its up to
developers who create

388
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,909
those applications those guys need to be
educated how

389
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:43,309
as this Ln validation checks really
should be used to in order to prevent

390
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:46,470
something like the next go to feel at
least a widely used at

391
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,399
so with that I'm really already at the
end of my presentation

392
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,950
thanks to some colleagues from my
university and my company

393
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,990
one from Asian is available at this link
and I'll be happy to take any questions

394
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:04,990
thank you

395
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,880
it's difficult to see questions and
nearly blinded

396
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,419
yes he

397
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:20,629
good

398
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:21,820
mud

399
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,500
in so I would say it's different when
it's difficult because we had the

400
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,380
test runs so i thinkI at least

401
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,900
20 percent off at least 20 percent

402
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,540
I failed at one of our test cases

403
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,500
or all so not only the first test run
which was more nationally but also

404
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,550
internationally so

405
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:49,320
roughly maybe twenty percent any other
questions

406
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,720
yes we'll

407
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,720
sorry could you shout out to me yes

408
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,660
so I how can you perform any additional
tests so we

409
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,440
I we will make this tool available so if
you are an app developer

410
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,250
please approach us and the you can get
this tool

411
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,930
we just do not want to put it yet fully
on the internet we had this request

412
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,930
I by banks so I

413
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,990
if you identify yourself to us and we
make sure we try to find out if you're a

414
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,170
bad fishing guy

415
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,940
them probably won't get it but if you
look somewhat legitimate will pass this

416
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,050
tool happily on to you so you can

417
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,110
I use it for your own the application
development or even

418
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,390
if you're procured from the outside
that's one way of doing it

419
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,960
any other questions okay

420
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,450
thank you very much
