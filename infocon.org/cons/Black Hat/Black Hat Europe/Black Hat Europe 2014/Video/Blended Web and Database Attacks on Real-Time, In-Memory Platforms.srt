00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,849
I want to tell you is at this was
supposed to be a two-man stark

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,850
so and we'll was not able to

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,150
come here because he has other things to
do so and unfortunately he's not going

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,019
to be here but

8
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,010
I'm gonna do the presentation so that
starts

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,380
first of all the disclaimer

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,079
which is in every presentation and when
and do a very quick introduction

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,750
on me and the company for those of
people

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,020
don't know one at CS on and what we do

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,469
is a company focused on business
critical applications security

14
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,510
so we focused on applications such as:

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,280
SAP Oracle PeopleSoft JD Edwards

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,500
to win this time that the supplications
are very critical

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,199
and are holding the the BCS crown jewels
so

18
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,260
weeee do a lot of things around it
security lots of two are

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,229
a.m. provide services such as Ben tests
am

20
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,899
mean tray a whole trainees

21
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,100
research a report on my so is far under
oath

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,770
a activities the dandy allows us to

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,229
do this kind of presentations technical
presentation see in this kind of

24
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,100
conferences

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,399
so 19 my name is kinda fun along the
name is one by Lovisa to russian

26
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,549
there so for you its SJP because they
had

27
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,659
also lovely friend combinations of my
name so just say

28
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,890
for for for EC for to make any seats AB

29
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,060
I work at the nazis be my CC beginning
doing research

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,959
my background is coming from the ink pen
test and the name

31
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,060
research on different drugs SAP Oracle

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,880
on other process well so it's a taking
about

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,450
well having said that let's jump into
their presentation

34
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,159
this is the agenda for today where gonna
and do

35
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,159
a brief introduction into the in memory
platforms or in memory databases

36
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,780
then lamented about SAP HANA and then

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,049
some threat or attack vectors to SAP
HANA

38
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,510
and it well all you have all the all
those

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,350
there around we're gonna go through each
one of them and then we are gonna draw

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,579
some conclusions

41
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:27,620
and for you to take out of the stock if
you're running

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,889
SAP or if you're running a sybian of
wheat on tap for Hannah

43
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,950
have an application's then I think you
will find this very interesting

44
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,680
sold the first slide that I wanted to

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,209
percent he say an introduction to the
memory databases right so

46
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,340
but then it started thinking and I
realized that

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,670
it's a very simple concept if you think
about it

48
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,700
eats and day to raise that is running

49
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,280
in memory made it's doing all the
processing of the tables

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,799
on the quay Reese modifications changes
everything

51
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,910
to the tables that are stored in the
main memory

52
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,860
right not in the sky even though there
is the storage holding the

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,500
the day the date and the tables all
details are

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,420
sense to the main memory and needs to be
able to be whole

55
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,690
I'm and the main memory in order to be
processed so that's basically the

56
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,370
concept it's not such a new concept

57
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,920
it's something that has been going on
out there

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,030
like since long time ago them if you
even if you go to Wikipedia

59
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,060
you will see that there are many
products our own

60
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,670
in memory databases them

61
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,830
then we started seeing a couple of years
ago

62
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,440
we focused heavily on SAP I'm

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,260
studied seen a hannah has started
talking about Hannah

64
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,660
I we realize that this is something
that's getting a lot of attention

65
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,160
and it's really growing but it's not
just ask school

66
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,840
was saying that right it's got nice also
im

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,489
saying that as well and we actually see
these

68
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,489
we see this every day with a new
implementations

69
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,160
with new customers so it didn't happen
before

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,150
well there are some things that

71
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,620
head this happening and its

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,979
it in the last part but I think it's
very important

73
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,270
the narration by right so these kind of
things

74
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,770
are coming in not so related to main
brother lines

75
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,850
but usually from their research labs on
the company's

76
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,640
right so and this is what happened with
this is behind as well so it's something

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,130
that

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,120
Israel in by innovation itself then we
have also

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,750
it cost of physical memory going down
rights own

80
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,030
we know the Swissy these every year we
know that

81
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,260
it's not the same have CCD love it. now
laptop

82
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,139
and

83
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,270
right now that in the last four years
ago or even

84
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,360
area so it's it's going down this making
things

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,879
a possible to have make sever sweet

86
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,389
256 tealights one terabyte of memory

87
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,430
of RAM memory right so this is what we
need actually to run these kind of

88
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,300
databases

89
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,619
and then also they said

90
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:18,430
an important the push from the business
itself

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,199
so we aren't usually from your ass with
business applications

92
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,009
am ERP CRM business intelligence

93
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,589
SCM all these kind of in business
applications at

94
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,649
I will talk about later but these
obligations are growing

95
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,089
not only in terms of their business
processes that are being

96
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:37,470
a

97
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,830
him process it through those obligations
but also

98
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,410
in terms of the data that is being I
managed sold

99
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,390
their reports that usually to sixty
meets

100
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,960
or 6 hours to be generated because it
was

101
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,920
using a lot of it tables acquiring a lot
of information

102
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,410
now with this kind of that now she can
be generated in america meaning to read

103
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,200
in seconds

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,360
so this is a big push out of the
business in order to achieve these

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,380
made on

106
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,760
Paul we have some Ben those involved
into these

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,360
in memory databases we have Oracle

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,370
this are the usual suspects right so we
have Oracle

109
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,270
we have Microsoft we have SAP the south
end up there

110
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,350
the most a well-known bender of

111
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,820
basis obligations Oracle is in

112
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,520
very dedicated to databases and also has
a lot of products

113
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,740
in terms of it business applications
such as financial people self

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,850
JD ed wants evil to all those who true
shown framework

115
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,340
all those applications are running
around the Oracle database but Oracle

116
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,300
12c

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,540
is the first one eat on providing

118
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,300
in memory features and then microsoft
also as you can see Microsoft SQL Server

119
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,110
to sup

120
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,330
2014 so it's kind of knew right I also

121
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,080
or at the term see East New to I know if
it was released already or not but

122
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
this is something very mean but then we
have

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,620
SAP HANA CB hannah has been around

124
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,410
a here around see it 2011

125
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,970
something like that there were twenty
less started to being implemented on

126
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,210
customer standby let implementations

127
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,300
on different deployment so where going
to focus

128
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,970
on SAP HANA and I'm gonna tell you why

129
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,270
soul just to illustrate these

130
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,640
am this in what I'm saying is

131
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,670
something for example from Oracle and
this is

132
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,720
exactly what what you will get from the
internet I'm with you

133
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,460
with you feel right its or their soft
money to the fastest

134
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,520
it said the difference within walking
I'm flying a plane any PC comparisons

135
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,410
you will see that it's true you will
have reports

136
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,510
and you will have results way faster
than with any other

137
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,120
a a key to Lake typical database right
in memory databases

138
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,480
are way faster I also

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,520
a about around the nation from SAP
another quote

140
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,200
I i really like this one because I think
it's very

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,540
you sorry in in this sense of what this
actually means

142
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,910
in memory computer ima competing for ACP

143
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,230
that you had the traditional approach at
Lucille so when the user or the

144
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,210
application layer

145
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,510
he summed up and then a you need to go
through and grab the data

146
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,560
a from the lower right but in the in
memory competing

147
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,979
you have this blended are key to that's
what we're gonna talk about this

148
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,210
in the same layer you have the
obligation in a year you have the

149
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,510
the web applications you have the you
says the authorizations and the data

150
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,070
itself

151
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,310
everything in a single brother I'm
finally

152
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,220
them this is just too to show you some
real-world examples right

153
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,420
SAP's pushing a so what's SAP HANA

154
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,450
providing a lot of brothers such as the
RB

155
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,610
CRM all the pieces sweet am

156
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,160
honor of proton huh not in terms of
analytics for example

157
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,000
the Seas after in Germany has won the
World Cup

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,060
am DC's actually

159
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,350
SAP saying that they were using SAP
Hannah

160
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,520
to the analytics I'm not too happy about
this because I'm from

161
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,280
Argentina originally so if you remember
the define a

162
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,050
well you know it's not so good but and

163
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,630
I think it's a great example to show
that this is something

164
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,880
that is being used by customers there
are a lot of companies

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,290
actually implementing and in the process
of migration

166
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,290
to SAP HANA and so that's

167
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,459
I N this is what I wanted to show you
with these a

168
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,910
quotes and examples so

169
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,010
let's talk about SAP anyone

170
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,290
running SAP doing best and dentist
recipe

171
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,990
all the thing is it be funnier with the
city okay

172
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,570
your leader the child but North

173
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,920
and is a piece everywhere is ABC

174
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,529
in in the biggest companies in the world
is the the biggest provider of business

175
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:10,750
management solutions

176
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,390
if you go to I needs it's not for SMBs
right even though it has

177
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,160
and solutions for SMBs for small and
medium businesses

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,800
80s in their biggest companies in the
world

179
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,050
and if you go to 142 mmm fun pay $100
for compact 500

180
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,680
for 210 all those companies most of
those companies are running

181
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,910
SAP software and Iranian the most
critical business processes

182
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,350
on top of this and does some numbers for
you too

183
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,250
get an idea of the not only the size of
the company itself

184
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,649
but this ice of the implementation from

185
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,790
from Manteca standpoint eats decisively
attacks are face right

186
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,820
if you see it like Microsoft is

187
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,880
im being research all over the world

188
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,600
yet you you will see a by suicide and

189
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,139
in exploits everywhere because the
attack surface is huge

190
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,230
while SAP also lease

191
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,810
that there are many implementations out
there so in even

192
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,610
he and its were unintended would think
he said that's a and b. attack surface

193
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,019
and a pretty good idea of the seceding
be so it's not

194
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,290
in small in SMB's it's in the biggest
companies in the world

195
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,410
and those companies are running that
kind of process

196
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,680
right Treasury embracing say's
production procurement

197
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,980
thats critical business information that
is being

198
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,810
stored and processed by the system's and
Hannah is being used for that

199
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,959
so what waste it so important in weight
daily focus on this

200
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,060
here because we started focusing on on
SAP and Oracle Applications

201
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,990
but then we also give research and study
to analyze

202
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,699
Hannah and the reason for this is
because is a beast

203
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,250
a panics SEP star pro right so

204
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,560
whenever they say new plantation he said
he's going to push

205
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,709
for this implementation to be and

206
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,130
implemented it through Hannah right but
by

207
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,660
implementing a hundred 80 East and not
for example an Oracle database

208
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,459
so that's one example then you have a
lot of new products

209
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,389
a new product line it supported by
Hannahs were

210
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,430
so there is a lot of a movement within
this

211
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,509
be in order to push Hannah and it's
really really important for exhibitors

212
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:31,079
migrations also are planned to go from
the typical databases such as

213
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,540
them Oracle SQL Server the two into

214
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,139
Mahan environment so

215
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,389
on and went to quickly finish with the
introduction

216
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:44,430
what I want to chill you here is that

217
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,589
we are talking about this at the sisters
were talking about

218
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,040
a memory databases their processing
basis critical

219
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,060
information right so in

220
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,620
in the sense we are not talking about
and someone

221
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,639
just exploiting a vulnerability and
having a root shell account

222
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,510
but we are

223
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,589
talking about someone explaining on a
meaty and connecting to the database

224
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,610
and retrieving these information such as
customers when those human resources

225
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,470
in a sheet when it's finished that also

226
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,330
we are not talking about am I know the
night of service someone

227
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,830
fascina brought the goal I'm breaking up
a service right

228
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,779
we are talking about someone fussing
abroad to go

229
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,470
I'm breaking up and missus assert his
arrest supporting

230
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,210
basis with the girl a process right so
someone

231
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,620
will paralyze abrasion like by breaking
up an interface by breaking

232
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,580
a connection between to SAP systems or
just chat the known the holy city system

233
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,589
so that's a salad the shit that I'm
finally from attack also

234
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:54,490
if I you serious a if an attack agreed
to you so we've had three wishes

235
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,500
on a axes bank account numbers squeakers
information modify some other is some

236
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,560
some vendor information treating you
employees all those attacks

237
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,450
can be possible can be made it because
of the

238
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,670
the nature of the information they
spawned all systems right

239
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,459
so in the slide what I want to
emphasizes the fact that we are not

240
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,400
talking about just

241
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,450
exploits up only have it is we are
talking about business processes

242
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,760
there are supported by these
technologies so

243
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,050
let's jump into SAP HANA is it behind a
cent in memory database

244
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,180
but what's really important or a really
interesting of this party said

245
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,990
it's sheep we then HTTP Server and

246
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,820
you have these integrated in today to
diesel

247
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,040
whenever you develop I said in a very
creating application

248
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,320
for SAP HANA we are creating an
application that's running

249
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
a on top of the database but into Gary

250
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,920
with the same users so that's that's
very important to understand from an

251
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,839
acceded to a point of view then there
are integrations with that somehow

252
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,380
a applications such as kardashian's
there were gonna

253
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,550
show some I'm gonna show some examples
about

254
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,800
integration to our server and I don't
know how that can be

255
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,130
actually treat into achieved something

256
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,120
them on what's important again

257
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,290
is at 80s supporting meet its
obligations right

258
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,920
it's not just the stand-alone database
it's not just a stand-alone

259
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,740
a web server is something that supports
and holds

260
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,170
real business information so what do we
say that

261
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,579
this is a blender that he did too so it
I love you that's

262
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:44,450
he usually analyzed a web application so
the bend this

263
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,050
am I use to the also web occasion
dentist in

264
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,020
long time ago as well we know how this
works right

265
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,459
typical applications and also SAP
NetWeaver

266
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,020
Rance in a very similar way typical
applications

267
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,130
are configured be in LA as approach

268
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,170
so you have the user's and and the
application

269
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,260
layer then there is a connection

270
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,150
from the application to the database
which is usually a single user

271
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,520
a that you serious

272
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,779
Asia legal field Texas all tables and
everything we teamed with navigation

273
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,540
anything that

274
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,720
should be reached by the application
should be reached by that user

275
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,220
and then we have an a plan

276
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,040
and a buddy system you said that he's
actually they use a running the database

277
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,700
itself

278
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,800
so it's a layered approach on if they if
someone wants to break into the

279
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,700
obligation

280
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,420
he will be able to John between the LAS

281
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,490
make exploiting a.m. ET for companies to
rejection

282
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,280
something to the database and then
jumping to the system

283
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,470
depending on that whenever it is that
are affecting their obligation sewed

284
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,220
in the scheme we have the senior user

285
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,180
on the database and a single user on the
operating system

286
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,260
so but we have several users connecting
to the web application like

287
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,960
however in the splendid architecture

288
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,430
we have a different approach we have

289
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,130
database users or application users

290
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,590
indeed in really depends on how you see
it which are

291
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,300
authenticating to database an ass these
integrate

292
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,590
we have the same source abusers
connecting

293
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,610
through HTTP or maybe through SQL

294
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,610
right so or the use or so the same
within the database and within the

295
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,560
application server

296
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,820
and the web occasion den there is an

297
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,850
like another layer which is the
operating system that is

298
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,580
supporting our executing all the Hannah
services and

299
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,490
providing a.m. like an interface for and
a

300
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,210
function course I know that so it's a
different approach

301
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,180
that's why we call it a blender
architecture that's because

302
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,360
is still high in different layers we
have now

303
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,760
two layers there integrated into a
single layer

304
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,910
so now the cease going to make someone
having a tea stain but the someone amity

305
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,230
sandy be different

306
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,880
for example

307
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,470
and I what's really interesting here is
a

308
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,980
this kind the fiery passion make and and
I'm in explaining why

309
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,650
in typical with ups an escalation action

310
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,030
and depending well it really depends on
that when I read itself I'm and other

311
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,170
factors tried but

312
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,910
usually and a you so that West newest

313
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,140
in order to execute Dolce Clarisse any
in shape they

314
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,150
the SQL commands is the you this either
use a right so that you sir

315
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,340
has full access to all the tables
therefore

316
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,680
an escalation usually it

317
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,450
ends have meaning a a full system gone
from my cell phone application

318
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,120
components

319
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,600
it really depends on the one every day
and some other factors but

320
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,320
the cease the typical brought however

321
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,700
in hand now we have a different scenario
because we have a moral obligation

322
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,850
that he's in today to database

323
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,030
so the same Hisar the East that the
other thing to the application is the

324
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,080
same he said that he's

325
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,610
executing any query if there is an
escalation for example

326
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,300
so it's really up to the authorizations
of that User

327
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,629
it's not is no longer a single user

328
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,510
with phone authorizations to all tables
so

329
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,630
they pretty deputy city of these when
everybody's

330
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,300
tends to be lower because you need to

331
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,530
mix it with some socially she knew to
get

332
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,390
after food really should use a ride to
two tricks on you said to that

333
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,130
however crusades greedy

334
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,890
in in into bigger weapon gay shows is
something that

335
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,320
needs to be mixed with socially she knew
you need to

336
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,890
target the user and you can still the
session you can do different things

337
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,770
depending on the

338
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,350
on the

339
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,130
in him programming language on on the
friend a

340
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,190
factors right however now with this
blender that Kitty to

341
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,549
and a integrative a.m.

342
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,110
there is a feature that is set by
default on every Hannah

343
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,110
system that I'm and when and this guy
later

344
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,419
but with the default features these
things to be

345
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,720
more critical because having had really
should you sir

346
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,650
would lead to an attempt at being able
to money fight any

347
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,150
bache within the Hannah system i'd it's
a matter of targeting the right you sir

348
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,950
and having and just the the the features
they are because of the ID

349
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,270
that is provided by default but it's a
matter of finding the right you sir I'm

350
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,600
the a full system comprised could be
achieved then some some other

351
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,850
facts for example they go to store it in
if I system

352
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,350
typically it really depends but usually
its story if I system

353
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,669
how every high night we have the cold
within the database

354
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm we will see how which %uh the place
that we need to execute in order to get

355
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,870
the

356
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,880
the call itself and actually it said go
that can be changed

357
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,980
and we've seen the application right if

358
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,289
if they right SQL query can be executed

359
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,789
the whole call could be modified another
fad

360
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,289
I in terms of voice commands is that

361
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,120
SAP really restricted the command
execution within Hannah

362
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,030
so these three-letter these two layers

363
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,200
then we see here the

364
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,530
jumping between the delay here and they
always layer

365
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,620
is very very difficult its be there is
no feature do that

366
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,890
like no liee it by the feature so if
there is a way to

367
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,799
actually execute voice commands that
said we have ATT

368
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:56,190
but by the four you know have any any
feature that allows you to

369
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,110
jumping to a buddy system that you have
with starr proceed you seen in our

370
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,370
databases for example

371
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,549
so it's restricted

372
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:09,929
some to more concerts Aradhana and then
we will jam

373
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,880
into the different attacks and there are
different

374
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,710
programming languages provided by Hannah
by the phone we have a very complex

375
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,510
stock

376
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,140
and different languages for example

377
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,799
X este es is a East Dallas group but
sever side

378
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,110
its it based on spider monkey just read

379
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,740
so it's a something well-known out there
we have SQL skills great

380
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,250
are cold on L cold here for

381
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,470
in time to see the US so we can actually

382
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,150
right to proceed your in an hour and
that will be executed

383
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,270
externally in a in a different system so
that's possible

384
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,400
a pup also we can code specific a lot go
them

385
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,510
that will that he steeled for Hannah

386
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,980
here to work faster and then ATM out
five

387
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,020
we have them all these it more while

388
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,520
im stock that is available in order to

389
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,549
develop mobile applications as well so
this is just an example right

390
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:17,059
we have more a more programming
languages as well

391
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,510
SAP he said brining a lot of it tools

392
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,919
on trainings and courses and other
information

393
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,450
and in order to a.m.

394
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,200
make people start calling on top of the
sprite and

395
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,080
to make new obligations and this is
important

396
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,380
them to understand some some other
further attacks

397
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,409
we have to waste into how to create

398
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:46,840
new gold within SAP HANA for web
applications

399
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,530
right that one is the hand as to the art
that's the

400
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,380
kind of the database client we get the
package

401
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,610
is tallied and connect to the database
am

402
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,929
we can modify any 95 we can create new
applications great you says the whatever

403
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:03,610
we want

404
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,409
that she has to heal but

405
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,860
on the other hand we also have the exits

406
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,250
excess I the this is and in David

407
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,240
a I D E which is by default on every
hand implementation so

408
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,660
if you have enough religious you can
actually create

409
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,690
a weapon gation through the web browser
right

410
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,530
connecting to the port 8,000 is a the
default

411
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,100
in URL into a thousand

412
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,530
AC CO CO CO and that's a URL but

413
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,590
if you have enough British issue come on
if I go the create you call

414
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,590
pay you says the whatever in

415
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,640
whatever you need to know to me say this
system however

416
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,010
in on the other side an attacker be able
to connect to the see if he got some

417
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:51,970
credentials

418
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,250
she will be able to also modify things
as well

419
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,809
so let's

420
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,580
took read a bit about that threat or
attack vector so SAP HANA

421
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,179
what's that this is the difference
between a typical a skinny section

422
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,690
an escalation action that is being
treated at within Hannah

423
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,730
own on one hand we have

424
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:20,670
the Hannah call and on the other side we
have a PHP example on

425
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,280
you will see that the first differences
these and single

426
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,000
are authentication of single you so
these that is being used

427
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,610
when you called application for example
the in PHP right

428
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,200
so the user is connected to database

429
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,010
this could be the store the in a

430
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,860
you notified whenever by the query sent
being executed with the single-user

431
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,390
however in Hannah we had this statement

432
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,530
DB get connection there's no user name
no bus word

433
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,920
that's basically its sick they say

434
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,720
hey I want to use I want to get a
connection to database using

435
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,620
my uses right so that's that's what's
going to happen

436
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,590
there is no X Asia for their shows its
only the you said that was

437
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,650
already authenticated to the system that
will be executing don't that

438
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,370
a sentence on you can see that both

439
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,679
obligations are born every to SQL
injection and

440
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,690
so this is and just an example for you
to see the differences

441
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,290
of both approaches so

442
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,470
when it comes to Scottish election it's
not only about

443
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,750
what's being executed or what can be

444
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,250
im appended to the to Ustream how we can
exploit these

445
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,610
how we can trigger this condition it's
not only about that

446
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,730
but its also about who is actually
treating that

447
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,050
right because it's not the same if I
have a and use everybody do you sir

448
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,300
and I did take and excretion any treated
that

449
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,740
within the application I can have
completely different results

450
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,120
if the SIS another you said treating
that same when everybody

451
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,410
so it's not about what's being executed
but also

452
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,790
it's about who so social engineering
attacks

453
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,470
ir very very important when he comes to

454
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,820
im for example doing a bend test on this
kind of a

455
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,010
implementations right so

456
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,620
I'm gonna do a quick them on this key
should chill

457
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,640
on Hannah hope okay

458
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,780
so this is very quick is an application

459
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,690
Ohana morning it was clearly section
what's happening here is that there's a

460
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,370
parameter

461
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,040
between egypt the with through sentence
that's okay

462
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,770
there is a single record in the in the
table however we can

463
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,040
a band something to get the data is
special for example

464
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,290
and that's what we're gonna do in order
to

465
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,370
a have additional information all this
information is so silly

466
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,990
in amp and this chichi destroyed by the
end of the presentation

467
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,890
so you will be able to see which other
commands there are useful in order to

468
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,460
get

469
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,110
additional information so

470
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,890
they cited nothing strange in Minack
initiation

471
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,270
it's a matter of knowing which is a
should come find

472
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,100
which is information though we going to
get depression database

473
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,320
company making in union with dinner
table

474
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,730
that there's nothing strange with that
however

475
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,200
there is something that them we saw in
terms of red

476
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,240
the tables that are comfier within
Hannah nice called

477
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,730
time travel and that's not something
that we we

478
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,700
created right the term is already being
used for that Roush inanity

479
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,550
so I don't know if you remember the same

480
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,150
screen or or even this movie so

481
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,780
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna show
you

482
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,679
that there are ways into getting
information from tables that

483
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,410
shouldn't be there or apparently is not
there so there is something that is

484
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,059
called

485
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,140
history tables and he saw the tables

486
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,200
is a concept very simple him

487
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,540
is basically inform our tables whose
information is never been deleted

488
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,559
but it's being kept track of

489
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,570
all the changes right so for example it
with an initial table

490
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,750
like the one we we have a

491
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,140
am in the upper section we had three
rows

492
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,250
however if we updates one of the roles

493
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,070
we will have an additional with the
change

494
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,000
and the the oration on modified so we
have a I and your old

495
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,050
in detail but we will have

496
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,150
the friends buddy from somebody to

497
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,200
thats chauvinists ass dates

498
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,980
and in the area table its its actually
know the dates but an

499
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,550
kami a the so but just for you too

500
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,410
to have an a an idea it's the and ABC's
Good to

501
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,740
understand sorry we delete something now
we see a different recording

502
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,870
whose body ti also changed right so it
changed

503
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,250
now we don't have a a question mark that
means that

504
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,460
if we want to query the table the
current state

505
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,990
off the table is gonna have only

506
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,070
their records whose body to date is not
being shown

507
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,250
but all the rest of the records are
still there

508
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,130
so let's say that we want to keep
confidential information or or very

509
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,690
sensitive information in table

510
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,980
I we want to keep track of that because
it's important information

511
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,670
were through any skinny section

512
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,880
someone with access to the table would
be able to

513
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,680
got there all the table all the contents
I something to

514
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,640
to keep in mind is the fact that we need
specifically

515
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,750
the lead the information right so it's
it's not something that

516
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,120
gets ultimately the lead either or its

517
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,820
nothing is the leading until we
specifically say so so there is a

518
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,710
command that

519
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,120
I'm gonna show yours so

520
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,460
conceptually time travel tables our
history tables

521
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,560
are tables post States start to cease
being tation

522
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,780
overtime and all the changes are being
recorded

523
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,400
some it commands for you to keep

524
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,549
as a reference how to create a history
table

525
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,870
how to least history tables this
important because

526
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,200
if we want to know if we have such a
table we need we need to execute that

527
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,860
command

528
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,880
and then if they if the user wants to

529
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,190
axis all the table like

530
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,190
the current status of the table that
would be select Start from table right

531
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,529
but if we want to let a specific study
also or specific comic I D

532
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:56,840
that's a the technical term if you want
to meet the specific amid a the weekend

533
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,929
specify that and we will get the table

534
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:02,960
acid was in that specific date

535
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,820
so that's something we can we can get
and also

536
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,740
and there is another way is specifying
request flax

537
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,580
make request blacks are almost that's on
our way

538
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,649
so we are not getting a specific comedy
but we are getting the whole table

539
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:22,399
so we will have way more results and

540
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,360
finally to the late the history
information that should be the command

541
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,409
I haven't tested it but that going to
with documentation that should be the

542
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:31,899
command

543
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:37,019
to the lead all the a.m. the comments
that are not the current one right

544
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:41,509
so let's see

545
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:44,899
and more interesting SQL injection

546
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:49,570
so what what we have here

547
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,580
East him you sir connecting to the

548
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,350
I D E the way we're interface so he's

549
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,769
authenticating to assist them he will

550
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,129
actually axis all the cattle I will be
able to see

551
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:07,720
on their the applications and we'll see
then they're born and application

552
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,789
and the tables so that's what he's doing
right now

553
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,909
it takes some time not something to

554
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,140
to say that unfortunately I cannot go on

555
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,340
Hannah system on a laptop because I it
will require a lot of memory so

556
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,970
I had to record the the Thames so

557
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,400
the user is connected to the ID to the
EM

558
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,640
it he succeeded got alone she will

559
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,120
show all the information its MOU

560
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,880
in a bit so

561
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,210
he can kid and sq browser for example

562
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,610
I'm least all the tables which are type
he story

563
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,310
so this is when they believe you sir
side the right to

564
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,520
take on that history tables so we see
accounts

565
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,140
that so he stay table so that there
might be something interesting there

566
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,340
but on the other hand we have an
obligation that is actually

567
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,659
connecting to that table I'm showing all
the information

568
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,060
so the in the ID

569
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,480
we have the autopsies package which
holds some

570
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,850
some applications someone have an
obligation some some

571
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,620
obligations that we developed for for
testing and these

572
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,940
applications specifically is very
similar to the other one heir to the one

573
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,990
we have a test construction it's
something that gets a parameter

574
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,250
eights being the put together with a
wary

575
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,389
and it's being executed so conceptually
is very similar

576
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,389
by the 21 to show you is the difference
that we did

577
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:49,100
when we execute an SQL injection
tradition it's ESC initiation

578
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,690
or when we apply some of these modifiers
so

579
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,650
now eats em we we are not providing any

580
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,760
ID parameter so once we provide the
parameter

581
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,860
we have the id1 we can have the ID to as
well

582
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,430
those are the only to records I will was

583
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,610
we will be able to validate that because
if we other

584
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,240
and

585
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,360
a two-sentence we will see that

586
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,600
those two records are the only ones in
the table right

587
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,470
so if we don't if we don't know that
that's a history table

588
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,210
that seat right and we can stick to that

589
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,360
however if we abandon dad modifier

590
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,570
we will have additional contents

591
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,080
dont maybe we're not see the

592
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,090
supposed to be shown Maurice information
that we don't want to

593
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,220
to be accessible right so that's that's
possible

594
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,440
if we have been some of these modifiers
to release

595
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,640
specific comment eighties or even get
the whole contents of the table

596
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,650
and then finally a C you sir what we're
doing is

597
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,290
showing least the status of the

598
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,970
account stable buddy to is not
configured for the first two

599
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,869
those are the first two records and
suppose we were

600
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,080
we show that these were the only ones
but then we have some others

601
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,330
which whereby leave Inc at some point in
some comment

602
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,470
so that's

603
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,930
that's a basically how you treat your
time travelers can chechen

604
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,710
with these historical tables in SAP HANA

605
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,490
soap for each one of the attacks

606
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,830
a.m. I'm gonna show you some
countermeasures well

607
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,490
this is air for the developers if they
if they are aware of the

608
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,950
this kind of where it is it's probably
something they know but

609
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,490
it's never a

610
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,710
it it's never too much to know all these
this kind of a counter measures

611
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,000
his paper statement do not concur than
eight

612
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,750
parameters are not a buddy eighty on in
the end

613
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,150
it's all about the user's permissions
right so it

614
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,490
there is a new requirement which should
be very very strong

615
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,830
on every issue implementation and that's
permissions

616
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,270
permissions now eat Ian before they

617
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,550
permissions were always very important
right but now its

618
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,420
even more critical because this is going
to defined ain't bad

619
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:25,240
of many of these women 80s and the web
player so

620
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,630
process discrediting him very quickly

621
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,030
Chris had scripting attacks you seen
these

622
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,300
and in there with all these default

623
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,300
built-in functionality could be even
more critical right because

624
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,960
having this kind of say cross-site
scripting

625
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,660
like this kind of scripps im

626
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,430
sent to you sir are being able to
execute in the use our site

627
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,490
targeting the URL that we see in our
Irish

628
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,320
that's a URL in the IB right so that's
that's a URL

629
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,730
of the application that can modify
anything we didn't within

630
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,100
SAP HANA so if the user has sufficient
privileges to that

631
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,190
then it's a marathon in the right you
sir

632
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,570
on sending something ad/ce modifying

633
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,180
or inserting or changing executing any

634
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,850
squarely within the database so this is
just an example

635
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:26,040
free to keep of what could be
potentially

636
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,310
and bad cross-site scripting attack
within SAP HANA

637
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,760
some some other accommodations in terms

638
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,280
pulled there's some summer
recommendations in terms of

639
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,080
cross-eyed is sorry im excess day is
cold

640
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,310
am the same there are different but
harry said could be affecting

641
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:47,810
X's ES cold for example the eve I'll

642
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:52,090
assignment that simply every T that a
nap there is simply no media

643
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,619
announces reporter

644
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:57,020
is to SAP a.m. our own people as well

645
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,530
so SAP already it published and advice
and sorry and some security note

646
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,859
so a.m. SAS AB or C behind a customer's
good

647
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:10,990
update their see stance and get it bites
for this kind of an LED is

648
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,440
however it's all about the cold right so
this this was simply a meeting the

649
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,470
standard gold

650
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,960
however if you have developers creating
your obligations

651
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,980
and they use the evil in any secure way

652
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,290
then you have whenever it's again
affecting the SAP HANA system

653
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,510
so all the say examples

654
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,880
are just to show you that even though

655
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,640
your a calling application excess JS
call

656
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,540
in which is a server-side JavaScript
code the application the whole

657
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,880
in up application and they have whole
Hannah sees them

658
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,670
could be in danger if it's not properly
called again

659
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,760
some countermeasures for these rested

660
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,050
packages expose the HDB am

661
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,100
its are you sir is Alferez to connect to
SQL

662
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,359
on to connect through ACP right so we
have a three stations to Lee Mead

663
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,850
which uses and which back issues we want
to restrict

664
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,030
for end-users through SQL through

665
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,300
am ATP I'm through different mechanisms
so they're

666
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,790
a.m. different British East such a
system application of shape and on TV

667
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,970
package users its complex

668
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,000
but it's something we need to tackle I
we need to take care of because

669
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,820
otherwise

670
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,130
air we can expose a whole

671
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,720
in

672
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,060
application enable cross-site request
forgery protection

673
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,180
am yep definitely validate all the
parameters

674
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:44,650
so let's talk about the integration with

675
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,540
our server anyone familiar with Ireland
which

676
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,920
good how when well I wasn't familiar
with this language before

677
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,369
a before us researching on these Hannah
platform

678
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:01,260
87 hoping it's used for

679
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,690
M they let like him doing things very
fast right analytics processing

680
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,650
things that needs I love processing
power them

681
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,660
it's very well-known in the academic

682
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,010
the field so we will see a lot of papers
and I've

683
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,460
work intense around are language

684
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,780
but ass SAP HANA East

685
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,270
heavily focused on an early TX I'm
processing

686
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,670
and performance it's provided an
interface to

687
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,270
our server for users to call that

688
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,020
it me proceed US in that language so

689
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,290
the CS SQL sentence that is creating

690
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,510
and procedural Brittany our language

691
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,760
in the red part just we need to remove
done and put the

692
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,170
our language there and that's it so

693
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,380
our server is going to be running in a
separated

694
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,680
host right it's not gonna be it
shouldn't be running

695
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,170
on the

696
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,890
a Hannah system I according to SAP's
recommendation should be trying

697
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,119
outside that they had a system however I
know

698
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,119
its it's up to the user how to implement
this right

699
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,150
so there are some

700
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,410
attacks and to the south are Sebring to
Gration

701
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,880
and because of the Greek idea of the
information that is being processed

702
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,109
we want to emphasize own all these
different attacks

703
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:32,010
so initially this must be is doubtless a
break and host

704
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,200
therefore from the AC behind its a

705
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,869
and Bronte from any other systems there
should be

706
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:42,220
a remote connection to the our server so
the port

707
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,819
needs to be listening to the network on

708
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:50,119
our server East also exposing hi
Brigitte functions

709
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,530
Lake remote shutdown on always kamensky

710
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,099
execution a within that our server so
that's

711
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:00,829
that something you will find within the
the are so a package

712
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:04,630
and then

713
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,849
if we talk about authentication on also

714
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:12,099
encryption of the traffic well for mas
pego feel we've

715
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:15,750
you South indication however there is
nothing forstmann the fat

716
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,010
it could be completed without any kind
of rough indication at all

717
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,430
on even if we go figure in the South
indication there are

718
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,760
there's no protection in terms of bus
restraint

719
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,240
into software brute force protection or
any other things like that

720
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,880
because thats on the our server side so

721
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,960
depending on the type of information we
are sending and receiving

722
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,410
this could be critical information this
could be basis information right

723
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,210
we might be sending something some
numbers to be calculated but we can be

724
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,250
kute some forecast or some

725
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,700
payroll total payroll all or anything
like it

726
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,119
it really depends on

727
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,119
how we in the sign and how we go that

728
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,350
so that could be it says city
information flowing through that by

729
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,510
default there is no

730
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,730
encryption so necessarily supported by
are several however

731
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,800
I'm not sure if it's supported by Hannah
and

732
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,970
SAP so this presentation so we the you
have any

733
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,430
any information about this is so my
guess is that it's still not supported

734
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,150
but it could be eventually at some point
so that

735
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,840
that information could be sneed if
undetected its access to the traffic

736
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,619
made so let's see some to more

737
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:38,300
in summer examples specifically for
attacks to our server integration

738
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,570
so this is a

739
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:45,570
a harness to the on is they had a client
am

740
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,090
if we go to Bros they cuddle and the
objects on the packages

741
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,500
we will see that the reset procedure

742
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,140
it takes time am so we come Bros

743
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,740
the system scheme and we can see the
procedures and we will see that there is

744
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,500
and special procedure that

745
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,570
could be Colleen our language we have

746
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,609
this is my F and my f2 the those are two
different procedures

747
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:17,400
if we axis the details of the procedure
we will see that

748
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,540
the primary risk being sent and received
and also

749
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,030
the the cold of the procedure itself

750
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,150
what's a the definition so once we

751
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,800
we have this information we can see the
Prometheus on also

752
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,090
the Phoenician right so we see language

753
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,210
I landed them told

754
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,250
this is and perceive your develop

755
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,670
it around our language so if we execute
dad

756
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,369
always have the results we will this is
a very basic

757
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:51,700
approach it this is where the

758
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,180
say the our server is configured it's
just

759
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,150
IP others Fort if we have authentication
information

760
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,680
it's there to so

761
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,660
we we can call the function

762
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,020
I we will get the results so we see that
this is something that is

763
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,150
actually run in bright it could be guide
to dating

764
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,400
anything around SAP HANA so

765
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,470
thats from our side but what an attacker
would try to do is

766
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:25,369
he would try to connect directly to our
server

767
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:29,260
for example he's bringing that IP
address that we saw before in the

768
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,310
configuration

769
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:34,680
doing an end not this could be a brother
a scanning these

770
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,310
just for that board its opener and they
said by some package

771
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,579
that is caused by are sadder that by
compac ish can be used

772
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:48,750
you know to connect to our server so
instead of going through Hannah

773
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,589
the attacker will try to go through the
our server

774
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:55,819
and Canadian to the our server for
example now

775
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:59,150
his importing this package and

776
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,180
doing a connection to the system

777
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,530
on after that what the attackers

778
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,670
going to try to the east just to jot
down and that's a

779
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,690
this is Tim they our server

780
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,940
was shut down so whenever there's a

781
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,160
buddy the request to execute this
function is gonna fail

782
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,819
so this could be breaking about it ABC's
interface

783
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:26,310
or something that is stylish or
depending on this function

784
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,980
the Seas blowing through that size right

785
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,310
however let's say that

786
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,760
the attacker to compromise the SAP HANA
I so

787
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,470
externally that's a good and shut down
the system but that say that

788
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,920
the are sever is restrictive the APS is
protected by a firewall

789
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,190
their issues authentication everything
is funny in a

790
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,440
is properly configured so

791
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,680
an attacker who has reason compromise
the city Hanna

792
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,910
what he could do is just drop

793
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,920
they proceeded that is already created
angry he some perceive you

794
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,690
might modify the existing procedure to
do

795
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,950
while they had a process for the for the
resolution that but it says there it's

796
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,270
system need you sir JP

797
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,690
the bus were slash as and then and

798
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,859
need to him you sir local group

799
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:24,180
on these traders say to to add the user
to a local group so

800
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,510
depending on the authorizations up that
our server

801
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,710
the the attacker could compromise the
XML system as well

802
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,839
rights going through that are several
practical

803
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,049
on creating a new user in the system so

804
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:41,859
after these what happens is that once

805
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,849
the procedure is executed it will be
executed

806
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:49,109
running not only the cold it was
developed to

807
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:52,680
actually run but also they call the that
US

808
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,829
a added by the attacker so this is a

809
00:48:56,829 --> 00:49:01,579
this just affiliation of these they are
so is running

810
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:04,890
we will see that a call to these

811
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,319
a function now is not only generating
the prime

812
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:13,710
or calculating the prime numbers but
also something different happened on the

813
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,599
screen right

814
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:17,680
the USS work with the use a wake was
created

815
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,010
and also the the use a West added to the
local administrator school

816
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,140
so this this is limited by the

817
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,510
by the authorization so the user but it
really depends on the

818
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,420
how this was implemented if its running
as a service a system account

819
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,880
these are the possible so the last

820
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,920
tape he's the attacker that connects to
the system

821
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,529
so that's its let's keep that he's gonna
get through Terminal Server just

822
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,430
somebody that that the site was created

823
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,000
so

824
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,830
countermeasures is secure that are
integration using a cell phone for your

825
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:00,360
authentication using something hrs
restrict access to a car servicing a

826
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,330
local firewall

827
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,600
you still British account so all these
recommendations

828
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,870
needs to be taken care of because I waz
hey there through our server

829
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:13,760
or through Hannah this could be abused
breaking up a buddy interface or even

830
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,500
compromising on a national system

831
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,820
breasted shut down and sees them I know
that

832
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,260
it's possible to receive shutdown I
don't know a lot system maybe some

833
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,420
expert on our server could comment on
that

834
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,510
and but if it's possible we should do it

835
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:33,870
am last day of the thread that doses
that

836
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,410
as I said before is it behind is
restricted from an

837
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,240
always calm an execution standpoint
there is no way for a body do so even

838
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,610
though the Sesame Street or to execute
voice commands

839
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:49,120
and the added the operating system
leather however

840
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,700
there are some ways to interact with see
gold

841
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,800
right for example CS excess see funk

842
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,650
he said wait to actually define and
we're big Asian that caused

843
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,030
and lay buried in the operating system
and then we have the AFL

844
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:08,380
that on also labor Reese that are
shipped by ASAP

845
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,440
in order to a extend the functionality
of the

846
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,870
SAP HANA system so these are two

847
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:20,230
ways that we have to interact with its
Eagle what we have a.m.

848
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,710
found these that its if the you serious
able to

849
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:26,900
just food and library or at least

850
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,110
control of I'll that is putting the
Hannah sees them so the recent

851
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:35,160
it this is a blog post expectation is
that right so he needs to be able to

852
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,830
pull

853
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,510
day a file or the library in this city
and operating system

854
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:43,780
but if that happens then it could be
possible to

855
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,420
actually a.m. execute commands because

856
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,140
the attacker will be able to the final
application calling that library

857
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,920
right sewing this weak example what we
see is

858
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,449
the race

859
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,599
them and it kind that was open in the
laptop

860
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,549
of the name of the attacker right then
the attacker

861
00:52:03,549 --> 00:52:07,059
creates these X X excesses fun

862
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:10,409
pointing to the liar and the library
that he

863
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:13,479
a blow that previously so he controlled

864
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:17,529
the library and base the into the day if
I system

865
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:20,599
so once now once they

866
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:24,909
would you around executed there's going
to be an execution

867
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:28,829
of that library and then what happens is
that

868
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:32,419
a remote shell will be called

869
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:36,799
to the and the attacker slapped a bright
so you can see here

870
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:41,059
user ID he's HC 01 ATM that to Hannah
system

871
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:44,929
the system administrator and that's an
interactive shell

872
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:49,619
that could be retrieved just because
there was a previous exploitation or

873
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:52,629
control of a file that was placed into
application server

874
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,729
so the as I said before this very
restricted

875
00:52:55,729 --> 00:53:00,269
in a city Hanna but if there's a breeze
compromise there could be a way

876
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:04,019
to bypass this that thats that's how it
works right

877
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:08,949
we need to have a piece exploitation
sold

878
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:13,569
chest to keep as a reference offender
search Ichi all the commands that we

879
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,929
have been talking about blast some
additional

880
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:19,589
for you to have how to get information
from

881
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:23,699
Hannah systems am one that I would like
to point out this

882
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:26,859
to lease the bus or hashes so those are
the

883
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:31,709
the you serve the password hashes I'll
of the user circle fear within

884
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,809
they sit behind and 80 is and that can
access both

885
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:38,049
the web server and also database if they
have the beaches

886
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:41,399
so let's there are some compressions

887
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:44,889
business-critical applications which are
the ground rules:

888
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,979
we know that these critical applications
are running

889
00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:51,599
the most critical business processes
within our company

890
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,159
are supported by the latest technologies
so we need to catch up with this guy we

891
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:56,679
need to

892
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:59,689
understand how these technologies are
better

893
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:03,609
in many ways but we need to secure them
properly

894
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:07,340
otherwise we can be exposing the whole
impressive

895
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,610
within the issue by adding is critical
to

896
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,920
restrict the permissions of the user's
it within Hannah

897
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,940
so before these it was very important
and now it's

898
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,600
even more important because we are
driving the impact of the different

899
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,480
minorities

900
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,810
them on finally

901
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:30,980
somehow not was built the with its
security focus in mind so we see that

902
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,240
because we have been

903
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,180
a.m. learning about Hannah we having
researching about Hannah

904
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,610
we know that this was built with a
security

905
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:44,350
in focus right however there are many
responsibilities that relies

906
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,350
on demonstrators on the user's on the
developers

907
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:51,310
so we need to catch up with that too and

908
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:56,620
finally this was a include by the SAP
bro to get a response team

909
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,790
some references for you to keep and

910
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,350
security guy and some white papers some
guides that

911
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,600
I think you will find useful if you want
to

912
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,730
keep for the learning about SAP HANA
security

913
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:13,380
so thanks to an abscess Research Labs
team

914
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,670
the they helped me a lot with them or so
on

915
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:21,470
their research as well I'm unfortunately
we'll we'll see the you make it

916
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,370
for today but he also helped a lot

917
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:27,990
for these for the research on for a
presentation so

918
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,320
if you have any questions the free to
ask I will be around here still

919
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,170
whenever you you have a question is
there any question

920
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,630
okay

921
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,560
so you can go to answer them and enjoi

922
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,280
in JC thank you all
